## Scroll I. Attica

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.1.1">

Belonging to the Greek
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnikē</span>\] mainland
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ēpeiros</span>\], facing the
Cyclades Islands and the Aegean Sea, is the headland
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">akrā</span>\] named Sounion,
jutting out from the land of Attica. When one[^1] has rounded the
headland \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">akrā</span>\] there
is a harbor and a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Athena
of-Sounion \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Souniás</span>\] on
the summit \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koruphē</span>\] of
the headland \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">akrā</span>\].
Farther on is Laurion, where once the Athenians had silver mines, and a
small uninhabited island called the Island of Patroklos.
I-say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] a fortification
was built on it and a palisade constructed by Patroklos, who was admiral
in command of the Egyptian trireme ships sent by Ptolemy, son of
Ptolemy, son of Lagos, to help the Athenians, when Antigonos, son of
Demetrios, was ravaging their country, which he had invaded with an
army, and at the same time was blockading them by sea with a fleet.[^2]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.1.2">

The \[harbor city\] Peiraieus was a deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] from early
times, though it was not a seaport
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-neion</span>\] before
Themistocles became an archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] of the
Athenians.[^3] Their seaport
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-neion</span>\] had been
Phaleron, for at this place the sea comes nearest to Athens, and from
here it is said that Menestheus sailed off with his fleet for Troy, and
before him Theseus, when he went off to give compensation to Minos for
the death of Androgeōs. But when Themistocles became archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\], since he
thought that the \[harbor city\] Peiraieus was more conveniently
situated for those who sail, and had three harbors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">limenes</span>\] as against
one at Phaleron, he made it \[= Peiraieus\] the Athenian seaport
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-neion</span>\]. Even up to
my time there were ship-sheds
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">neōs oikoi</span>\] there, and
near the largest harbor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">limēn</span>\] is the tomb of
Themistocles. For it is said that the Athenians repented of their
treatment of Themistocles, and that his relatives took up his bones and
brought them from Magnesia. And the children of Themistocles certainly
returned \[to Athens\] and set up in the Parthenon a painting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\] in which \[the
figure\] of Themistocles has been painted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphesthai</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.1.3">

Worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] in the Peiraieus
is a precinct \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\]
of Athena and Zeus. Both their statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] are of
bronze; Zeus holds a scepter and a Nike, Athena a spear. Here is \[a
painting of\] Leosthenes and \[of\] his sons, painted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] by
Arkesilaos. This Leosthenes at the head of the Athenians and the united
Greeks \[Hellēnes\] defeated the Macedonians in Boeotia and again
outside Thermopylae forced them into Lamia over against Oitē, and hemmed
them in there.[^4] It \[= the painting\] is in the long portico
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoā</span>\], where is
located a marketplace
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agorā</span>\] for those
living near the sea—those farther away from the harbor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">limēn</span>\] have
another—but behind the portico near the sea stand a Zeus and a
\[personified\] Dēmos, the work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] of Leokhares.
And by the sea Konon[^5] built a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Aphrodite,
after he had crushed the Lacedaemonian warships off Knidos in the Carian
peninsula.[^6] I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] the people of
Knidos honor \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmân</span>\]
Aphrodite greatly, and they have sanctuaries
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiera</span>\] of the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\]; the
oldest is to her as Doritis \[‘Bountiful’\], the next in age as Akraia
\[‘of the Headland’\], while the newest is to the Aphrodite called ‘of
Knidos’ by people generally, but Euploia \[‘Good Sailing’\] by the
people of Knidos themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.1.4">

The Athenians have also another harbor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">limēn</span>\], at Mounukhia,
with a temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Artemis of Mounukhia, and yet another at Phaleron, as I have already
stated, and near it is a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Demeter.
Here there is also a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Athena
Skiras, and one of Zeus some distance away, and altars of the gods named
Unknown \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Agnōstoi</span>\], and
of heroes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\], and
of the children of Theseus and Phaleros; for this Phaleros is said by
the Athenians to have sailed with Jason to Kolkhis. There is also an
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of
Androgeōs, son of Minos, though it is called that of Hērōs; those,
however, who pay special attention to the study of their
local-antiquities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">enkhōria</span>\] know that it
belongs to Androgeōs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.1.5">

Twenty stadium-lengths away is the headland
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">akrā</span>\] called Kōlias;
to this place, when the Persian fleet was destroyed, the wreckage was
carried down by the waves. There is here a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the
Aphrodite surnamed Kōlias, together with goddesses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theai</span>\] called
Genetyllides \[presiding-over-childbirth\]. And I am of opinion that the
goddesses \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theai</span>\] of
the people of Phokaia in Ionia, whom they call Gennaides, are the same
as those at Kōlias. On the way from Phaleron to Athens there is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Hērā with
neither doors nor roof. It is said that Mardonios, son of Gobryas,
burned it. But the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] there today
is, as report goes, the work of Alkamenes.[^7] So that this, at any
rate, cannot have been desecrated by the Persians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.2.1">

As one enters the city, there is a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\][^8] of Antiope
the Amazon. This Antiope, Pindar says, was abducted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harpazein</span>\] by
Peirithoös and Theseus, but Hegias of Troizen has created-poetically
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] about her such
things as I will now tell. Hēraklēs was besieging Themiskyra at \[the
river\] Thermodon, and could not take it, but Antiope,
having-conceived-a-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erastheisa</span>\] for
Theseus, who was aiding Hēraklēs in his campaign, surrendered the
stronghold. These things has Hegias created-poetically
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]. But the
Athenians assert that when the Amazons came \[to attack Athens\],
Antiope was shot by Molpadia \[the Amazon\], while Molpadia was killed
by Theseus. The Athenians have a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\][^9] of Molpadia
as well.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.2.2">

As one goes up from the Peiraieus there are ruins of the walls that
Konon restored after the naval battle offshore from \[the island of\]
Knidos. I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] those \[walls\]
that had been built by Themistocles after the retreat of the Persians
were destroyed during the rule
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] of the
so-called Thirty.[^10] Along the road are some very well-known tombs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphoi</span>\]: that of
Menander, son of Diopeithes, and a cenotaph
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma kenon</span> ‘empty
tomb’\] of Euripides. He \[= Euripides\] himself went to King Arkhelaos
\[of Macedonia\] and lies buried in Macedonia; as for the way
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tropos</span>\] he died—many
have narrated it—let it be as they say.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.2.3">

I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] even in his time
\[= the era of Euripides\] poets
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiētai</span>\] could live in
the company of kings, as earlier still Anacreon resided in the company
of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos; also, Aeschylus and Simonides were sent
to Hieron at Syracuse. Residing in the company of Dionysius, tyrant in
Sicily at a later period, was Philoxenos, and, residing in the company
of Antigonos,[^11] ruler of Macedonia, were Antagoras of Rhodes and
Aratos of Soloi. As for Hesiod and Homer, they either did not have the
good fortune of residing in the company of kings or else purposely
neglected doing so, Hesiod because of his countryside ways
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agroikiā</span>\] and
reluctance to travel, while Homer, having traveled very far and wide,
considered the aid provided by the powerful in the acquisition of wealth
to be less important than his fame
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\] among the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hoi polloi</span>. And yet
Homer, too, in what he composed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\], makes
Demodokos live in the compnay of Alkinoos, and \[he makes\] Agamemnon
leave behind \[when the king departed for Troy\] a poet
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiētēs</span>\] to attend his
wife. Not far from the gates is a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\], on which is
positioned a soldier
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stratiōtēs</span>\] standing
by a horse. Who it is I do not know, but both horse and soldier were
carved by Praxiteles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.2.4">

On entering the city there is a building for the preparation of the
processions \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pompai</span>\],
which are arranged
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pempein</span>\] in some cases
every year, in other cases at longer intervals. Close by is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Demeter, with
statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of
her and of her daughter, and of Iakkhos holding a torch. On the wall, in
Attic letters, is written that they are works of Praxiteles. Not far
from the temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\]
is Poseidon on horseback, hurling a spear against the giant
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gigas</span>\] Polubōtēs,
concerning whom is prevalent among the people of Kos the myth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mūthos</span>\] about the
promontory \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">akrā</span>\] of
Khelōnē. But the inscription of our time assigns the likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] to another, and
not to Poseidon. Extending from the gate to the Kerameikos there are
porticoes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoai</span>\], and
in front of them bronze likenesses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] of such as
had some title to fame
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\], both men and
women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.2.5">

One of the porticoes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoai</span>\] contains
shrines \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiera</span>\] of
gods, and a gymnasium named after Hermes. In it is the house
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikiā</span>\] of Poulutiōn,
at which it is said that a mystical-rite
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teletē</span>\] was once
performed \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\] by
Athenians of considerable fame, corresponding to the mystical-rite
performed at Eleusis. But in my time it was devoted to the worship of
Dionysus. This Dionysus they call Melpomenos \[from
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">melpesthai</span> ‘sing and
dance’\], on the same principle as they call Apollo Mousēgētēs ‘Leader
of the Muses’. Here there are statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Athena
Paiōniā), of Zeus, of Mnemosyne \[‘Memory’\] and of the Muses, an
Apollo, the votive-offering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēma</span>\] and work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] of Euboulides,
and Akratos, a superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] who is one of
the attendants of Dionysus \[Jones mistakenly says “Apollo” here\]; it
is only a face
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prosōpon</span>\] of him,
worked-into
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en-oikodomeîn</span>\] the
wall \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toikhos</span>\].
Situated beyond the precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] of Apollo is
a building \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma</span>\]
that contains terracotta statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\]: Amphiktyon,
king of Athens, in the act of celebrating-at-a-feast
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hestiân</span>\] Dionysus and
other gods. Here also is Pēgasos of Eleutherai, who introduced the god
to the Athenians. Participating-in-the-action
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-lambanesthai</span>\] was
the oracle \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteion</span>\]
at Delphi, which called-to-mind
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-mnē-sai</span>\] that the
god once dwelled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-dēmeîn</span>\] in Athens
in the days of Ikarios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.2.6">

Amphiktyon acquired the kingdom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileiā</span>\] thus. It is
said that Aktaios was the first to become-king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\] of what is
now Attica. When Aktaios died, Kekrops received-by-relay
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ek-dekhesthai</span>\] the
rulership \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\],
housed-together
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-oikeîn</span>\] as he was
with the daughter of Aktaios, and there were born to him daughters,
Hersē, Aglauros and Pandrosos, and a son Erysikhthon. This son did not
become king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\] of the
Athenians, but happened to die while his father lived, and the one who
inherited-by-relay
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ek-dekhesthai</span>\] the
kingdom of Kekrops was Kranaos, who surpassed at the time the other
Athenians with his power. They say that Kranaos had daughters, and among
them Atthis; and from her they call the region Attica, which before was
named Aktaia. And Amphiktyon, leading an insurrection against Kranaos,
although he had his daughter as wife, deposed him from rulership
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\]. Afterwards he
himself was deposed as the result of an insurrection organized by
Erikhthonios and his followers. They say that Erikhthonios was not born
of humans \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\],
but that his parents were Hephaistos and Earth \[Gē\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.3.1">

The locale \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōrion</span>\]
known as the Kerameikos has its name from the hero Keramos, and they say
that he too was son of Dionysus and Ariadne. First on the right is what
is called the Royal Portico
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Sto</span><span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ā
Basileios</span>\], where is seated the archon-king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] when holding
the yearly rulership
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] that is named
after the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn
basileus</span>. On the tiling
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">keramos</span>\] of this
portico \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoā</span>\] are
statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] made
of terracotta, Theseus throwing Skiron into the sea and Day \[Hēmerā\]
carrying away Kephalos, who they say was most beautiful and was abducted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harpazein</span>\] by Day, who
conceived-a-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erasthēnai</span>\] for him.
His son was Phaethon, afterwards abducted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harpazein</span>\] by
Aphrodite) \[…\] and he was made a guardian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulax</span>\] of her temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\]. That is what is
said by Hesiod, among others, in his verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epos</span> plural\] having to
do with women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.3.2">

Near the portico \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoā</span>\]
stand \[the statues of\] Konon, Timotheus his son, and Euagoras,[^12]
King of Cyprus, who exacted a gift of Phoenician trireme ships to be
given to Konon by King Artaxerxes. This he did as an Athenian whose
ancestry connected him with Salamis, for he traced-his-lineage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">geneālogeîn</span>\] back to
Teukros as also to the daughter of Kinyras. Here stand \[the statue of\]
Zeus, called Zeus Eleutherios \[‘of Freedom’\], and \[the statue of\]
‘King’ \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\]
Hadrian, who made-public-displays
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-deiknusthai</span>\] of
his benefactions to all the populations that he ruled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhein</span>\]—and
especially to the city of the Athenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.3.3">

Another portico \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoā</span>\]
is built behind \[the one I just talked about\], and this one has
paintings \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\] of
the gods called the Twelve. On the wall opposite are painted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphesthai</span>\] Theseus,
\[personified\] Democracy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Dēmokratiā</span>\], and
\[personified\] <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Dēmos</span>.
The painting \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\]
represents Theseus as the one who established for the Athenians a system
of governance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">politeuesthai</span>\]
on-an-equal-footing \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ex
isou</span>\]. In other ways as well did the story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] spread among
the people—the story that Theseus bestowed upon them the management of
their own affairs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pragmata</span>\], and that
from his time onward the people continued to have-a-democratic
government
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmokrateîsthai</span>\],
until the emergence of Peisistratos, who became-tyrant
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turanneîn</span>\].[^13]
Granted, the majority of people tell and are told many other things as
well—things that are not true
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">alēthē</span>\], since people
are ignorant of scientific-research
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">historiā</span>\] and consider
trustworthy whatever they have heard, from childhood onward, in choruses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khoroi</span>\] and tragedies
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tragōidiai</span>\]. There are
stories like that also concerning Theseus, who himself became king, and
afterwards, when Menestheus died, the descendants of Theseus remained
rulers even to the fourth generation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">geneā</span>\]. But if I cared
about tracing-lineages
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">geneālogeîn</span>\] I should
have included in the counting, besides these, the kings starting from
Melanthos extending all the way to Kleidikos the son of Aisimides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.3.4">

Also painted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphesthai</span>\] here is
the exploit, near Mantineia, of the Athenians who were sent to help the
Lacedaemonians.[^14] Xenophon among others has written a history of the
whole war—the taking of the Kadmeia, the defeat of the Lacedaemonians at
Leuktra, how the Boeotians invaded the Peloponnesus, and the contingent
sent to the Lacedaemonians from the Athenians. The painting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\] shows a
cavalry battle, in which the most famous men are, among the Athenians,
Grylos the son of Xenophon, and, in the Boeotian cavalry, Epameinondas
the Theban. These paintings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\] were painted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] for the
Athenians by Euphranor, and he also did the Apollo surnamed Patrōos
\[‘Ancestral’\] in the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] close by. In
front of the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] is an Apollo
that Leokhares made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]; \[also in
front is\] another Apollo, called Alexikakos \[‘averter of evil’\], made
by Kalamis. They say that the god received this name because, by way of
an oracular pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteion</span>\] from Delphi,
he stopped the pestilential disease
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nosos</span>\] that afflicted
the Athenians at the time of the Peloponnesian War.[^15]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.3.5">

Here is built also a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of the Mother
of the gods; she \[= her statue\] is by Pheidias. Close by is the
council-chamber
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleutērion</span>\] of those
called the Five Hundred, who for a term of a year act-as-councilors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleuein</span>\] on behalf
of the Athenians. In it are a wooden-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] of Zeus
Boulaios and an Apollo, the work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnē</span>\] of Peisias,
and a \[personified\] Dēmos, a work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] by Lyson. As
for the lawgivers
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thesmothetai</span>\], they
were painted \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\]
by Protogenes[^16] of Kaunos, and Olbiades painted Kallippos, who led
the Athenians to Thermopylae to stop the incursion of the Gauls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Galatai</span>\] into Greece
\[Hellas\].[^17]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.4.1">

These Gauls \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Galatai</span>\]
inhabit the most remote portions of Europe, near a great sea that is not
navigable all the way to its extremities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">perata</span>\], and has tides
and fauna quite unlike those of other seas. Through their territory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōrā</span>\] flows the river
Ēridanos, on the banks of which the Daughters of Hēlios \[‘Sun’\] are
customarily thought to be lamenting the experience
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pathos</span>\] of their
brother Phaethon. It was late before the name
<span custom-style="chs_foreign">Gauls</span>
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Galatai</span>\] prevailed;
for in ancient times they were called Celts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Keltoi</span>\] both among
themselves and by others. An army of them gathered and turned towards
the Ionian Sea. They dispossessed the Illyrian people and all who
dwelled as far away as Macedonia, along with the Macedonians themselves.
Then they overran Thessaly. And when they drew near to Thermopylae, the
Greeks \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] in
general made no move to prevent the incursion of the barbarians, since
previously they had been severely defeated by Alexander and Philip.
Further, Antipatros and Kassandros[^18] afterwards crushed the Greek
side \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò Hellēnikon</span>\],
so that, because of their weakness, each state thought it was not
shameful to take no part in the defense.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.4.2">

But the Athenians, although they were more exhausted than any of the
other Greeks \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\]
by the long Macedonian war, and had been generally unsuccessful in their
battles, nevertheless set forth to Thermopylae with such Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] as joined
them, having made the Kallippos I mentioned their general. Occupying the
pass where it was narrowest, they tried to keep the barbarians from
entering Greece \[Hellas\]; but the Celts, having discovered the path by
which Ephialtes of Trakhis once led the Persians,[^19] overwhelmed the
men of Phokis stationed there and crossed Oitē unperceived by the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.4.3">

Then it was that the Athenians put the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] under the
greatest obligation, and although outflanked offered resistance to the
barbarians on two sides. But the Athenians in the fleet suffered most,
for the Lamian gulf is a swamp near Thermopylae—the reason being, I
think, the hot water that here runs into the sea. These then were more
distressed, and the reason is this: taking the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] on board,
they were forced to sail through the mud, weighed downas they were by
arms and men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.4.4">

So, they tried to save the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] in the way
described, but the Gauls, now south of the Gates \[= Thermopylae\],
cared not at all to capture the other towns, but were very eager to
plunder Delphi and the treasures of the god. They were opposed by the
people of Delphi themselves and by the men of Phokis who originated from
the cities around Mount Parnassus; a force of Aetolians also joined the
defenders, for the Aetolians at this time were preeminent for their
vigorous resistance. When the forces engaged, not only were thunderbolts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">keraunoi</span>\] and rocks
broken off from Parnassus hurled against the Gauls, but
terrifying-shapes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">deimata</span>\] that looked
like armed warriors appeared to the barbarians. They say that two of
these apparitions, Hyperokhos and Amadokos, came from the Hyperboreans,
and that the third was Pyrrhos son of Achilles. Because of this help in
battle the Delphians sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">enagizein</span>\] to Pyrrhos
\[as to a hero\], although formerly they held even his tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] in dishonor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">atīmiā</span>\], as being that
of an enemy.[^20]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.4.5">

The greater number of the Gauls crossed over to Asia \[Minor\] by ship
and plundered its coasts. Some time after, the inhabitants of Pergamon,
which was called in ancient times Teuthrania, drove the Gauls into this
region, away from the sea. Now this population occupied the country on
the farther side of the river Sangarios, capturing Ankyra, a city of the
Phrygians, which Midas son of Gordios had founded in former time. And
the anchor \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ankura</span>\],
which Midas found, was even as late as my time in the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Zeus, as
well as a spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\] called the
Spring of Midas, water from which they say Midas mixed with wine to
capture Silenos. Well then, the Pergamenes took Ankyra and Pessinos
which is situated under Mount Agdistis, where they say that Attis lies
buried.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.4.6">

They \[= the Pergamenes\] have spoils-of-war \[captured\] from the
Gauls, and a painting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\] that portrays
their deed \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\]
against them. The land they dwell in was, they say, in ancient times
sacred \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierā</span>\] to the
Kabeiroi, and they claim that they are themselves Arcadians, being
descended from those who crossed into Asia \[Minor\] with Telephos. Of
the wars that they have waged no story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] has been made
public to the world-at-large, except that they have accomplished three
most notable achievements: the subjection of the coastal region of Asia
\[Minor\], the expulsion of the Gauls from there, and the exploit of
Telephos against the followers of Agamemnon, at a time when the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\], after
failing to reach Troy, were plundering the plain called Mēion, thinking
it Trojan territory. Now I will return from my digression.

Near to the council-chamber

sacrifice \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\], and
there are a few small statues

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\], from whom
afterwards the Athenian subdivisions
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phūlai</span>\] received their

The heroes known as the eponymous ones
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epōnumoi</span>\] are \[1\]
Hippothoön son of Poseidon and of Alope daughter of Kerkyon, \[2\]
Antiokhos, whose father was Hēraklēs and whose mother was Meda daughter
of Phylas, thirdly, \[3\] Ajax son of Telamon, and, among the Athenians,
\[4\] Leōs, who is said to have given up \[as human sacrifice\] his
daughters in accordance with what was-said-in-an-oracular-pronouncement

be communal \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koinē</span>\] for
all; also among the eponymous-heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epōnumoi</span>\] is \[5\]
Erekhtheus, who conquered the Eleusinians in battle, and killed their
general, Immarados the son of Eumolpos; there is also \[6\] Aigeus, and
\[7\] Oineus the bastard son of Pandion, and \[8\] Akamas, one of the
children of Theseus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.5.3">

I saw also among the eponymous-heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epōnumoi</span>\] the
likenesses \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] of
\[9\] Kekrops and \[10\] Pandion, but I do not know who among those who
have these names are given the honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\] \[of being
venerated as an eponymous hero. I say this because there was an earlier
Kekrops who was-ruler
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhein</span>\]—his wife was
the daughter of Aktaios—and there was also a later Kekrops—the one who
led-a-colonizing-expedition
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">met-oikeîn</span>\] to Euboea.
This one was son of Erekhtheus son of Pandion son of Erikhthonios. And
there was a king Pandion who was son of Erikhthonios, and another who
was son of Kekrops the second. This man \[Pandion\] was deposed from his
rule \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] by the
Mētionidai, and when he fled to Megara—for he had as wife the daughter
of Pylas king of Megara—his children were banished with him. And Pandion
is said to have fallen ill there \[in Megara\] and died, and on the
coast of the region of Megara is his tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\],[^22] situated
on the cliff called the rock of Athena the Aithuia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.5.4">

But his sons \[= the sons of Pandion\] expelled the Mētionidai, and
returned from their exile at Megara. Then Aigeus, as the eldest, became
king of the Athenians. As for his daughters \[by contrast with his
sons\], on the other hand, there was no benevolent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agathos</span>\]
superhuman-force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] to help him
raise them, nor did they \[= these daughters\] leave him with any sons
who could avenge him \[the same way that his sons avenged him against
the Mētionidai\]. And yet it was for the sake of \[his own\] power
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dunamis</span>\] that he
\[Pandion\] had made a marriage-alliance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kēdos</span>\] with the man
from Thrace \[= Tereus, king of Thrace\]. Well, there is no way
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poros</span>\] for a mortal to
evade what is sent by a god as a thing that the god deems to be fitting
to send. They say that Tereus, though he was married to Procne, violated
Philomela. Thus, \[Thracian that he was,\] he transgressed the custom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomos</span>\] of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\]. And, on top
of that, he mutilated the body
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sōma</span>\] of the daughter
\[of Pandion,\] \[cutting out her tongue\]. By doing so, his action led
the women \[= the daughters of Pandion\] to resort to \[what was for
them\] the necessity of retribution
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span>\]. There is also
another statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andrias</span>\] of Pandion on
the Acropolis, and it is worthy of viewing

These are the Athenian eponymous-heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epōnumoi</span>\] who belong
to the ancients
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhaioi</span>\].[^23] And of
later date than these they have subdivisions
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phūlai</span>\] named after
the following: Attalos[^24] the Mysian[^25] and Ptolemy the
Egyptian,[^26] and within my own time\*[^27] ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\]Hadrian
,[^28] who was most observant in giving honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\] to divinity
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò theion</span>\] and who
contributed very much to the happiness

whom he ruled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhein</span>\]. He never
voluntarily entered upon a war, but he reduced the Hebrews
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hebraioi</span>\] who lived
beyond Syria; they had rebelled.[^29] As for the sanctuaries
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiera</span>\] of the gods

cities that are Greek
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnides</span>\], and
sometimes even to barbarians who asked him, all these acts are inscribed
in his honor in the sanctuary

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.1">

But as for what pertains to Attalos and Ptolemy, it is more ancient in
point of time, so that the story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] no longer
remains, and those who attended these kings for the writing-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun=graphē</span>\] of their
deeds fell into neglect even before \[= before the story failed\]. So,
it occurred to me to highlight
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēloûn</span>\] their deeds
also, and how the rule
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] of Egypt, of
the Mysians, and of the neighboring peoples fell into the hands of the
ancestors \[of these rulers\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.2">

[^30] The Macedonians consider Ptolemy to be the son of Philip, the son
of Amyntas, though putatively the son of Lagos, asserting that his
mother was pregnant when she was married off to Lagos by Philip. And
among the distinguished acts of Ptolemy in Asia they mention that it was
he who, of all the companions of Alexander, was foremost in helping him
when in danger among the Oxydrakai. After the death of Alexander,[^31]
by withstanding those who would have conferred all his empire
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] upon Aridaios,
the son of Philip, he became chiefly responsible for the division of the
various nations \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ethnē</span>\]
into the kingdoms
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileiai</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.3">

He crossed over to Egypt in person, and killed Kleomenes, whom Alexander
had appointed satrap of that country, considering him a friend of
Perdikkas, and therefore not faithful to himself; and the Macedonians
who had been entrusted with the task of carrying the corpse
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nekros</span>\] of Alexander
to Aigai, he persuaded to hand it over to him. And he proceeded to
entomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thaptein</span>\] it,
in the ritual-way
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomos</span>\] of the
Macedonians, in Memphis, but, knowing that Perdikkas would make war, he
kept Egypt garrisoned. And Perdikkas took Aridaios, son of Philip, and
the boy Alexander, whom Rōxanē, daughter of Oxyartes, had borne to
Alexander, to create some decorum for the military campaign, but really
he was plotting to take from Ptolemy his kingdom in Egypt. But being
expelled from Egypt, and having lost his reputation as a soldier, and
being in other respects unpopular with the Macedonians, he was killed by
his bodyguards.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.4">

The death of Perdikkas immediately raised Ptolemy to power, who both
reduced the Syrians and Phoenicia, and also welcomed Seleukos, son of
Antiokhos, who was in exile, having been expelled by Antigonos; he
further himself prepared to attack Antigonos. He prevailed on
Kassandros, son of Antipatros, and Lysimakhos, who was king in Thrace,
to join in the war, on the grounds that Seleukos was in exile and that
the growth of the power of Antigonos was dangerous to them all.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.5">

For a time Antigonos prepared for war, and was by no means confident of
the issue; but on learning that the revolt of Cyrene had called Ptolemy
to Libya, he immediately reduced the Syrians and Phoenicians by a sudden
attack, handed them over to Demetrios, his son, a man who for all his
youth had already a reputation for good sense, and went down to the
Hellespont. But he led his army back without crossing, on hearing that
Demetrios had been overcome by Ptolemy in battle. But Demetrios had not
altogether evacuated the country before Ptolemy, and having surprised a
force of Egyptians, killed a few of them. Then on the arrival of
Antigonos Ptolemy did not wait for him but returned to Egypt.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.6">

When the winter was over, Demetrios sailed to Cyprus and overcame in a
naval action Menelaos,[^32] the satrap of Ptolemy, and afterwards
Ptolemy himself, who had crossed over to bring help. Ptolemy fled to
Egypt, where he was besieged by Antigonos on land and by Demetrios with
a fleet. In spite of his extreme peril Ptolemy saved his empire
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] by making a
stand with an army at Pēlousion while offering resistance with warships
from the river. Antigonos now abandoned all hope of reducing Egypt,
under the circumstances, and dispatched Demetrios against the Rhodians
with a fleet and a large army, hoping, if the island were won, to use it
as a base against the Egyptians. But the Rhodians displayed daring and
ingenuity in the face of the besiegers, while Ptolemy helped them with
all the forces he could muster.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.7">

Antigonos thus failed to reduce Egypt or, later, Rhodes, and shortly
afterwards he offered battle to Lysimakhos, and to Kassandros and the
army of Seleukos, but he lost most of his forces, and was himself
killed, having suffered most by reason of the length of the war with
Eumenes. Of the kings who put down Antigonos I hold that the most unholy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-hosios</span>\] was
Kassandros, who although he had recovered the throne of Macedonia with
the aid of Antigonos, nevertheless came to fight against a benefactor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.6.8">

After the death of Antigonos, Ptolemy again reduced the Syrians and
Cyprus, and also restored Pyrrhos to Thesprotia on the mainland. Cyrene
rebelled; but Magas, the son of Berenikē (who was at this time married
to Ptolemy) captured Cyrene in the fifth year of the rebellion. If this
Ptolemy really was the son of Philip, son of Amyntas, he must have
inherited from his father his madness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò epi-manes</span>\] for
women, for, while wedded to Eurydikē, the daughter of Antipatros,
although he had children he went into a state-of-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\] for Berenikē,
whom Antipatros had sent to Egypt with Eurydikē. Having
conceived-a-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erastheis</span>\] for this
woman, he had children by her, and when his end drew near he left the
kingdom of Egypt to Ptolemy (after whom the Athenians name their
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulē</span>) being the son of
Berenikē and not of the daughter of Antipatros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.7.1">

This Ptolemy, having-conceived-a-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erastheis</span>\] for
Arsinoe, his full sister, married her, violating Macedonian custom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizomena</span>\] in doing
so, but following that of his Egyptian subjects. Secondly he put to
death his brother Argaios, who was, it is said, plotting against him;
and it was he who brought down from Memphis the corpse
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nekros</span>\] of
Alexander.[^33] He put to death another brother also, son of Eurydikē,
on discovering that he was creating disaffection among the Cypriotes.
Then Magas, the half-brother of Ptolemy, who had been entrusted with the
governorship of Cyrene by his mother Berenikē—she had borne him to
Philip, a Macedonian but of no note and of lowly origin—induced the
people of Cyrene to revolt from Ptolemy and marched against Egypt.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.7.2">

Ptolemy fortified the entrance into Egypt and awaited the attack of the
Cyrenaeans. But while on the march Magas was informed that the
Marmaridai, a tribe of Libyan nomads, had revolted, and thereupon fell
back upon Cyrene. Ptolemy resolved to pursue, but was checked owing to
the following circumstance. When he was preparing to meet the attack of
Magas, he engaged mercenaries, including some four thousand Gauls.
Discovering that they were plotting to seize Egypt, he led them through
the river to a deserted island. There they perished at one another’s
hands or by famine.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.7.3">

Magas, who was married to Apame, daughter of Antiokhos, son of Seleukos,
persuaded Antiokhos to break the treaty that his father Seleukos had
made with Ptolemy and to attack Egypt. When Antiokhos resolved to
attack, Ptolemy dispatched forces against all the subjects of
Antiokhos—he sent plunderers to overrun the lands of the weaker, and an
army to hold back the stronger—so that Antiokhos never had an
opportunity to attack Egypt. I have already stated how this Ptolemy sent
a fleet to help the Athenians against Antigonos and the Macedonians, but
it did very little to save Athens. His children were born of Arsinoe—not
his sister, but the daughter of Lysimakhos. His sister who had wedded
him happened to die before this, leaving no issue, and there is in Egypt
a district called Arsinoites after her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.8.1">

It is pertinent to add here a report about Attalos, because he too is
one of the Athenian eponymous-heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epōnumoi</span>\]. A
Macedonian by the name of Dokimos, a general of Antigonos, who
afterwards surrendered both himself and his property to Lysimakhos, had
a Paphlagonian eunuch called Philetairos. All that Philetairos did to
further the revolt from Lysimakhos, and how he won over Seleukos, will
form an episode in my account of Lysimakhos. Attalos, however, son of
Attalos and nephew of Philetairos, received the kingdom from his cousin
Eumenes, who handed it over. The greatest of his achievements was his
forcing the Gauls to withdraw from the seacoast into the region that
they still hold.

Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes.[^34] Here also is Demosthenes, whom the
Athenians forced to retire to Kalaureia, the island off Troizen, and
then, after receiving him back, banished again after the disaster at
Lamia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.8.3">

Exiled for the second time[^35] Demosthenes crossed once more to
Kalaureia, and committed suicide there by taking poison, being the only
Greek \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēn</span>\] exile
whom Arkhias failed to bring back to Antipatros and the Macedonians.
This Arkhias was a man from Thourioi who undertook the unholy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-hosion</span>\] task of
bringing to Antipatros for punishment those who had opposed the
Macedonians before the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] met with
their defeat in Thessaly. Such was Demosthenes’ reward for his great
devotion \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eu-noia</span>\] to
Athens. I think it is well said, the saying that no man who has
unsparingly thrown himself into political-life
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">politeiā</span>\] trusting in
the loyalty of the democracy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tà tou dēmou</span>\] has ever
met with a beautiful death.

Near the likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of Demosthenes
is a sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\]
of Ares, where are placed two statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of
Aphrodite, one of Ares made by Alkamenes, and one of Athena made by a
man from Paros by the name of Lokros. There is also a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Enyo, made
by the sons of Praxiteles. About the temple stand \[images of\]
Hēraklēs, Theseus, Apollo binding his hair with a fillet
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tainiā</span>\], and statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andriantes</span>\] of
Kalades, who it is said to have framed laws for the Athenians, and of
Pindar, and this likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] \[of Pindar\]
is one of the rewards the Athenians gave him for praising
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ep-aineîn</span>\] them in a
song that he made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.8.5">

Close by stand statues of Harmodios and Aristogeiton, who killed
Hipparkhos.[^36] The reason
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\] for this deed
and the way it was done have been related by others; of the statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andriantes</span>\] some were
made by Kritios, the old ones being the work of Antenor. When Xerxes
captured Athens after the Athenians had abandoned the city he took away
these statues also among the spoils, but they were afterwards restored
to the Athenians by Antiokhos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.8.6">

Before the entrance of the theater
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theatron</span>\] that they
call the Odeum
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ōideion</span>\] are statues
of Egyptian kings. They are all alike called Ptolemy, but each has his
own surname. For they call one Philometor, and another Philadelphos,
while the son of Lagos is called Soter, a name given him by the
Rhodians. Of these, Philadelphos is he whom I have mentioned before
among the eponymous-heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epōnumoi</span>\], and near
him is a likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of his sister
Arsinoe.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.1">

The one called Philometor is eighth in descent from Ptolemy son of
Lagos, and his surname was given him in sarcastic mockery
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khleuasmos</span>\], for we
know of none of the kings who was so hated by his mother. Although he
was the eldest of her children she would not allow him to be called to
the throne, but prevailed on his father before the call came to send him
to Cyprus. Among the reasons assigned for Kleopatra’s enmity towards her
son is her expectation that Alexander the younger of her sons would
prove more subservient, and this consideration induced her to urge the
Egyptians to choose Alexander as king.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.2">

When the people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">plēthos</span>\] offered
opposition, she dispatched Alexander for the second time to Cyprus,
ostensibly as general, but really because she wished by this means to
make Ptolemy more afraid of her. Finally she covered with wounds those
eunuchs she thought were best disposed \[toward her, and thus least
likely to object\], and she presented them to the people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">plēthos</span>\], pretending
that she was the victim of Ptolemy’s machinations, and that he had
treated the eunuchs in such a fashion. The people of Alexandria rushed
to kill Ptolemy, and when he escaped on board a ship, made Alexander,
who returned from Cyprus, their king.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.3">

Retribution for the exile of Ptolemy came upon Kleopatra, for she was
put to death by Alexander, whom she herself had made to be king of the
Egyptians. When the deed was discovered, and Alexander fled in fear of
the citizens, Ptolemy returned and for the second time assumed control
of Egypt. He made war against the Thebans, who had revolted, reduced
them two years after the revolt, and treated them so cruelly that they
were left not even a memorializing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hupomnēma</span>\] of their
former prosperity, which had so grown that they once surpassed in wealth
the richest of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\], even the
sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of
Delphi and the people of Orkhomenos. Shortly after this Ptolemy met with
his appointed fate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">moira</span>\], and the
Athenians, who had been benefited by him in many ways, which I need not
stop to relate, set up a bronze \[statue\] of him and of Berenikē, his
only legitimate child.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.4">

Next in line after the Egyptians are set up the statues of Philip and of
his son Alexander. The events of their lives were too important to make
digressive remarks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parerga</span>\] in what is
another story. In the case of the Egyptians, they had their tokens of
gratitude bestowed upon them because the honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\] they received
was genuine and because they were benefactors, but it was rather the
sycophancy \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kolakeiā</span>\]
of the people \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">plēthos</span>\]
that resulted in tokens of gratitude to Philip and Alexander, since they
set up a \[statue of\] Lysimakhos also not so much out of goodwill
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eunoiā</span>\] as because
they thought it would serve their immediate ends.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.5">

This Lysimakhos was a Macedonian by birth and one of Alexander’s
bodyguards
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doruphoroi</span>\], whom
Alexander once in anger shut up in a chamber with a lion, and afterwards
found that he had overpowered the beast. Henceforth he always treated
him with respect, and honored him as much as the noblest Macedonians.
After the death of Alexander, Lysimakhos ruled those of the Thracians,
who are neighbors of the Macedonians, who had been under the sway of
Alexander and before him of Philip. These would comprise but a small
part of Thrace. If populations be compared with populations no people
except the Celts are more numerous than the Thracians taken all
together, and for this reason no one before the Romans reduced the whole
Thracian population. But the Romans have subdued all Thrace, and they
also hold such Celtic territory as is worth possessing, but they have
intentionally overlooked the parts that they consider useless through
excessive cold or barrenness.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.6">

Then Lysimakhos made war against his neighbors, first the Odrysai,
secondly the Getai and their king Dromikhaites. Engaging with men not
unversed in warfare and far his superiors in number, he himself escaped
from a position of extreme danger, but his son Agathokles, who was
serving with him then for the first time, was taken prisoner by the
Getai. Lysimakhos met with other reverses afterwards, and attaching
great importance to the capture of his son made peace with Dromikhaites,
yielding to the king of the Getai the parts of his empire beyond the
Istros, and, chiefly under compulsion, giving him his daughter in
marriage. Others say that not Agathokles but Lysimakhos himself was
taken prisoner, regaining his liberty when Agathokles made a treaty with
the king of the Getai on his behalf. On his return he married to
Agathokles Lysandra, the daughter of Ptolemy, son of Lagos, and of
Eurydikē.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.7">

He also crossed with a fleet to Asia (Minor) and helped to overthrow the
empire \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] of
Antigonos.[^37] And he founded the modern city of Ephesos, extending as
far as the coast, bringing to it as settlers people of Lebedos and
Kolophon, after destroying their cities, so that the iambic poet Phoenix
composed-a-lament
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thrēneîn</span>\] for the
capture of Kolophon. Mermesianax, the one who wrote
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] elegies
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">elegeia</span>\], was, I
think, no longer living, otherwise he too would certainly have been
moved by the taking of Kolophon to make-a-lament
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oduresthai</span>\].
Lysimakhos also went to war with Pyrrhos-son-of-Aiakidēs. Waiting for
his departure from Epeiros—Pyrrhos was of a very roving disposition—he
ravaged Epeiros until he reached the royal tombs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thēkai</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.9.8">

The next parts of the story are not credible
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pista</span>\] to me, but
Hieronymos of Kardia writes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] that he \[=
Lysimachus\] destroyed the tombs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thēkai</span>\] and cast out
the bones of the corpses. But this Hieronymos has a reputation generally
of being biased against all the kings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileîs</span>\] except for
Antigonos, and of being unfairly partial towards him. As to the
treatment of the tombs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphoi</span>\] of the people
of Epeiros, it is perfectly plain that it was malice that made him
record that a Macedonian destroyed the tombs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thēkai</span>\] of the dead.
Besides, Lysimakhos was surely aware that they were the ancestors not of
Pyrrhos only but also of Alexander. In fact, Alexander was a native of
Epeiros and descended from the lineage of the Aiakidai on his mother’s
side, and the subsequent alliance between Pyrrhos and Lysimakhos proves
that even as enemies they were not irreconcilable. Possibly Hieronymos
had grievances against Lysimakhos, especially for his destroying the
city of the people of Kardia and founding Lysimakheia in its stead on
the isthmus of the Thracian Chersonesus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.10.1">

As long as Aridaios reigned, and after him Kassandros and his sons,
friendly relations continued between Lysimakhos and Macedon. But when
the kingdom devolved upon Demetrios, son of Antigonos, Lysimakhos,
henceforth expecting that war would be declared upon him by Demetrios,
resolved to take aggressive action. He was aware that Demetrios
inherited a tendency to aggrandize, and he also knew that he visited
Macedonia at the summons of Alexander and Kassandros, and on his arrival
murdered Alexander himself[^38] and ruled the Macedonians in his stead.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.10.2">

For these reasons he clashed with Demetrios at Amphipolis and came near
to being pushed out from Thrace,[^39] but after Pyrrhos came to his aid
he mastered Thrace and afterwards extended his empire at the expense of
the Nestians and Macedonians. The greater part of Macedonia was under
the control of Pyrrhos himself, who came from Epeiros with an army and
was at that time on friendly terms with Lysimakhos. When, however,
Demetrios crossed over into Asia (Minor) and made war on Seleukos, the
alliance between Pyrrhos and Lysimakhos lasted only as long as Demetrios
continued hostilities; when Demetrios submitted to Seleukos, the
friendship between Lysimakhos and Pyrrhos was broken, and when war broke
out Lysimakhos fought against Antigonos son of Demetrios and against
Pyrrhos himself, had much the better of the struggle, conquered
Macedonia and forced Pyrrhos to retreat to Epeiros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.10.3">

Erotic-passion \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\]
has a way of bringing many calamities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sumphrorai</span>\] for
humans. Lysimakhos, although by this time of mature age and considered
happy \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eudaimōn</span>\] in
respect of his children, and although Agathokles had children by
Lysandra, nevertheless married Lysandra’s sister Arsinoe. This Arsinoe,
fearing for her children, lest on the death of Lysimakhos they should
fall into the hands of Agathokles, is said for this reason to have
plotted against Agathokles. People have already written
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] about how
Arsinoe got into a state of erotic-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\] for Agathokles,
and, being unsuccessful, they say that she plotted against his life.
They say also that Lysimakhos discovered later his wife’s machinations,
but by now, toward the end, he had no resources left, having lost all
who were near-and-dear
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">philoi</span>\] to him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.10.4">

Since Lysimakhos, then, entrusted to Arsinoe the murder of Agathokles,
Lysandra fled to Seleukos, taking along her children and her brothers,
who were taking refuge with Ptolemy and who finally adopted this course.
They were accompanied on their escape to Seleukos by Alexander, who was
the son of Lysimakhos by an Odrysian woman. So, going up to Babylon,
they entreated Seleukos to make war on Lysimakhos. And, at the same
time, Philetairos, to whom the property of Lysimakhos had been
entrusted, aggrieved at the death of Agathokles and suspicious of the
treatment he would receive at the hands of Arsinoe, seized
Pergamon-on-the-Kaïkos, and sending a herald offered both the property
and himself to Seleukos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.10.5">

Lysimakhos, hearing of all these things, lost no time in crossing into
Asia (Minor),[^40] and, taking the initiative, he attacked Seleukos,
suffered a severe defeat, and was killed. Alexander, his son by the
Odrysian woman, after interceding long with Lysandra, won possession of
his body and afterwards conveyed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\] it to the
Chersonesus and buried it, where his tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] is still to be
seen between the district
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmē</span>\] of Kardia and
Paktye.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.11.1">

Such were the things that happened in connection with Lysimakhos. The
Athenians have also a likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of Pyrrhos.
This Pyrrhos was not related to Alexander, except by way of genealogy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">genos</span>\]. Pyrrhos was
son of Aiakidēs, son of Arybbas, but Alexander was son of Olympias,
daughter of Neoptolemos, and the father of Neoptolemos and Arybbas was
Alketas, son of Tharypos. And from Tharypos to Pyrrhos, son of Achilles,
are fifteen generations
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">geneai</span>\]. Now, Pyrrhos
was the first who after the capture of Troy disdained to return to
Thessaly, but sailing to Epeiros dwelled there following the
oracular-pronouncements
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsmoi</span>\] of Helenos.
By Hermione Pyrrhos had no child, but by Andromache he had Molossos,
Pielos, and Pergamos, who was the youngest. Helenos also had a son,
Kestrinos, being married to Andromache after the killing of Pyrrhos at
Delphi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.11.2">

Helenos on his death passed his rulership
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] to Molossos,
son of Pyrrhos, so that Kestrinos with volunteers from the people of
Epeiros took possession of the region beyond the river Thyamis, while
Pergamos crossed into Asia (Minor) and killed Areios, despot in
Teuthrania, who fought with him in single combat for the rulership
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\], and gave his
name to the city which is still called after him.[^41] For Andromache,
who accompanied him, there is still a hero-shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\] in the
city.[^42] Pielos remained behind in Epeiros, and to him as ancestor
Pyrrhos-son-of-Aiakidēs and his fathers traced their descent, and not to
Molossos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.11.3">

Down to the time of Alketas, son of Tharypos, Epeiros too was under one
king. But the sons of Alketas after a quarrel agreed to rule with equal
authority, remaining faithful to their compact; and afterwards, when
Alexander, son of Neoptolemos, died among the Leukanoi, and Olympias
returned to Epeiros through fear of Antipatros, it was Aiakidēs, son of
Arybbas, who continued in allegiance to Olympias and joined in her
campaign against Aridaios and the Macedonians, although the men of
Epeiros refused to accompany him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.11.4">

Olympias on her victory behaved in-unholy-ways
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-hosia</span>\] in the
matter of the death of Aridaios, and in even more-unholy-ways
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-hosia</span>\] with regard
to certain Macedonian men, and for this reason was considered to have
deserved her subsequent treatment at the hands of Kassandros; so
Aiakidēs at first was not received even by the people of Epeiros because
of their hatred of Olympias, and when afterwards they forgave him, his
return to Epeiros was next opposed by Kassandros. When a battle occurred
at Oineadai between Philip-brother-of-Kassandros and Aiakidēs, it was
Aiakidēs who was wounded and who shortly after met what was fated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò khreōn</span>\].[^43]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.11.5">

The people of Epeiros accepted Alketas as their king, being the son of
Arybbas and the elder brother of Aiakidēs, but of an uncontrollable
temper \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thūmos</span>\] and on
this account banished by his father. Immediately on his arrival he began
to take out his insanity
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mainesthai</span>\] on the
people of Epeiros, until they rose up and put him and his children to
death at night. After killing him they brought back
Pyrrhos-son-of-Aiakidēs. No sooner had he arrived than Kassandros made
war on him, while he was young in years and before he had consolidated
his empire \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\].
When the Macedonians attacked him, Pyrrhos went to Ptolemy, son of
Lagos, in Egypt. Ptolemy gave him as wife the half-sister of his
children, and restored him by way of an Egyptian force.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.11.6">

The first of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] that Pyrrhos
attacked on becoming king were the people of Corcyra. He saw that the
island was near his own territory, and he did not wish others to have a
base from which to attack him. My account of Lysimakhos has already
related how he \[= Pyrrhos\] fared, after taking Corcyra, in his war
with Lysimakhos—how he expelled Demetrios and ruled Macedonia until he
was in turn expelled by Lysimakhos, the most important of his
achievements until he waged war against the Romans,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.11.7">

being the first Greek
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēn</span>\] we know of to
do so. For no further battle, it is said, took place between Aeneas and
Diomedes with his Argives. One of the many ambitions of the Athenians
was to reduce all Italy, but the disaster at Syracuse[^44] prevented an
encounter then with the Romans. Alexander, son of Neoptolemos, of the
same family as Pyrrhos but older, died among the Leukanoi before he
could engage the Romans in battle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.12.1">

So Pyrrhos was the first to cross the Ionian Sea from Greece \[Hellas\]
to attack the Romans.[^45] And even he crossed on the invitation of the
people of Tarentum. For they were already involved in a war with the
Romans, but were no match for them unaided. Pyrrhos was already in their
debt, because they had sent a fleet to help him in his war with Corcyra,
but the most cogent arguments of the envoys of Tarentum were their
accounts of Italy, how its prosperity was equal to that of the whole of
Greece \[Hellas\], and their plea that it was unholy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-hosion</span>\] to dismiss
them when they had come as friends and suppliants in their hour of need.
When the envoys urged these considerations, Pyrrhos remembered the
capture of Troy, which he took to be an omen of his success in the war,
as he was a descendant of Achilles making war upon a settlement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apoikiā</span>\] of Trojans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.12.2">

Pleased with this proposal, and being a man who never lost time when
once he had made up his mind, he immediately proceeded to man war ships
and to prepare transports to carry horses and men-at-arms. There are
books \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">biblia</span>\] written
by men of no renown when it comes to writing-things-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-graphē</span>\], which are
called commentaries
\[<span custom-style="chs_emphasis">hupomnēmata</span>\]. When I read
these I marveled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thaumazein</span>\] greatly
both at the personal bravery of Pyrrhos in battle, and also at the
forethought \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pronoia</span>\]
he displayed whenever a conflict was imminent. So, on this occasion also
when crossing to Italy with a fleet he eluded the observation of the
Romans, and for some time after his arrival they were unaware of his
presence; it was only when the Romans made an attack upon the people of
Tarentum that he appeared on the scene with his army, and his unexpected
assault naturally threw his enemies into confusion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.12.3">

And being perfectly aware that he was no match for the Romans, he
prepared to let loose against them his elephants. The first European to
acquire elephants was Alexander, after subduing Poros and the power of
the Indians; after his death others of the kings got them but Antigonos
more than any; Pyrrhos captured his beasts in the battle with Demetrios.
When on this occasion they came in sight the Romans were seized with
panic, and did not believe they were animals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.12.4">

For although the use of ivory in arts and crafts all men obviously have
known for a long time, the actual beasts, before the Macedonians crossed
into Asia, nobody had seen at all except for the Indians themselves, for
the Libyans, and for their neighbors. This is proved by Homer, who
describes the couches and houses of the more prosperous kings as
ornamented with ivory, but never mentions the beast; but if he had seen
or heard about it he would, in my opinion, have been much more likely to
speak of it than of the battle between the dwarf-men and cranes.[^46]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.12.5">

Pyrrhos was brought over to Sicily by an embassy of the Syracusans. The
Carthaginians had crossed over and were destroying the Greek
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnides</span>\] cities,
and had set up a siege of Syracuse, the only city now remaining. When
Pyrrhos heard this from the envoys he abandoned Tarentum and the
Italiots on the coast, and crossing into Sicily forced the Carthaginians
to raise the siege of Syracuse. In his self-conceit, although the
Carthaginians, being Phoenicians of Tyre by ancient descent, were more
experienced seafarers than any other barbarian people of that day,
Pyrrhos was nevertheless encouraged to engage them in a naval battle,
employing the people of Epeiros, the majority of whom, even after the
capture of Troy, knew nothing of the sea nor even as yet how to use
salt. Witness the words of Homer in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>:

Defeated on this occasion, Pyrrhos retreated with the remainder of his
vessels to Tarentum. Here he met with a serious reverse. And his
withdrawal, for he knew that the Romans would not let him depart without
striking a blow, he contrived in the following manner. On his return
from Sicily and his defeat, he first sent various dispatches to Asia
(Minor) and to Antigonos, asking some of the kings for troops, some for
money, and Antigonos for both. When the envoys returned and their
dispatches were delivered, he summoned those in authority, whether from
Epeiros or from Tarentum, and without reading any of the dispatches
declared that reinforcements would come. A report spread quickly even to
the Romans that Macedonians and men from Asia (Minor) also were crossing
to the aid of Pyrrhos. The Romans, on hearing this, made no move, but
Pyrrhos, on the approach of that very night, crossed to the headlands of
the mountain called Keraunion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.2">

After the defeat in Italy, Pyrrhos gave his forces a rest and then
declared war on Antigonos, his chief ground of complaint being the
failure to send reinforcements to Italy. Overpowering the native troops
of Antigonos and his Gallic mercenaries he pursued them to the coast
cities, and himself reduced upper Macedonia and the Thessalians. The
extent of the fighting and the decisive character of the victory of
Pyrrhos are shown best by the Celtic armor dedicated in the sanctuary of
Itonian Athena between Pherai and Larisa, with this inscription on them:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

These shields did the Molossian one, as a gift to Itonian Athena,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.3">

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thauma</span>\],

since the Aiakidai are masters of the spear, even now as also in the
past.

</div>

These shields then are here, but the shields of the Macedonians
themselves he dedicated to Dodonian Zeus. They too have an inscription:

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

These \[shields\] once ravaged the golden land of Asia,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

</div>

Pyrrhos came very near to reducing Macedonia entirely, but,

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.4">

being usually readier to do what came first to hand, he was prevented by
Kleonymos. This Kleonymos, who persuaded Pyrrhos to abandon his
Macedonian adventure and to go to the Peloponnesus, was a Lacedaemonian
who led a hostile army into the Lacedaemonian territory for a reason I
will relate after giving the descent of Kleonymos. Pausanias, who was in
command of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] at
Plataea,[^48] was the father of Pleistoanax, he of Pausanias, and he of
Kleombrotos, who was killed at Leuktra fighting against Epameinondas and
the Thebans. Kleombrotos was the father of Agesipolis and Kleomenes,
and, Agesipolis dying without issue, Kleomenes ascended the throne.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.5">

Kleomenes had two sons, the elder being Akrotatos and the younger
Kleonymos. Now Akrotatos died first; and when afterwards Kleomenes died,
a claim to the throne was put forward by Areus son of Akrotatos, and
Kleonymos took steps to induce Pyrrhos to enter the country. Before the
battle of Leuktra[^49] the Lacedaemonians had suffered no disaster, so
that they even refused to admit that they had yet been defeated in a
land battle. For Leonidas, they said, had won the victory,[^50] but his
followers were insufficient for the entire destruction of the Persians;
the achievement of Demosthenes and the Athenians on the island of
Sphakteria[^51] was no victory, but only a trick in war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.6">

Their first reverse took place in Boeotia, and they afterwards suffered
a severe defeat at the hands of Antipatros and the Macedonians.[^52]
Thirdly the war with Demetrios[^53] came as an unexpected misfortune to
their land. Invaded by Pyrrhos and seeing a hostile army for the fourth
time, they arrayed themselves to meet it along with the Argives and
Messenians who had come as their allies. Pyrrhos won the day, and came
near to capturing Sparta without further fighting, but desisted for a
while after ravaging the land and carrying off plunder.[^54] The
citizens prepared for a siege, and Sparta even before this in the war
with Demetrios had been fortified with deep trenches and strong stakes,
and at the most vulnerable points with buildings as well.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.7">

Just about this time, while the Laconian war was dragging on, Antigonos,
having recovered the Macedonian cities, hastened to the Peloponnesus
being well aware that if Pyrrhos were to reduce Lacedaemon and the
greater part of the Peloponnesus, he would not return to Epeiros but to
Macedonia to make war there again. When Antigonos was about to lead his
army from Argos into Laconia, Pyrrhos himself reached Argos. Victorious
once more he dashed into the city along with the exiles, and his
formation not unnaturally was broken up.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.8">

When the fighting was now taking place by sanctuaries and houses, and in
the narrow lanes, between detached bodies in different parts of the
city, Pyrrhos, left by himself, was wounded in the head. It is said that
his death[^55] was caused by a blow from a tile thrown by a woman. The
Argives however declare that it was not a woman who killed him but
Demeter in the likeness of a woman. This is what the Argives themselves
relate about his end, and Lykeas, the exegete
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ex-hēgetēs</span>\] for the
local-population
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\], has also
said so in hexameters
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\]. They \[= the
Argives\] have a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Demeter,
built in accordance with an oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrē-</span>\], on the spot
where Pyrrhos died,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.13.9">

and, in there, Pyrrhos is buried. I consider it a wonder
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thauma</span>\] that, of those
who are called Aiakidai, three met their end
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teleutē</span>\] in the same
kinds of way through the agency of the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ek tou theou</span>\]—if, as
Homer says, Achilles was killed by Alexander, son of Priam, and by
Apollo, and if the people of Delphi were bidden by the Pythia to slay
Pyrrhos, son of Achilles, and if the end of the son of Aiakidēs was such
as the Argives say and as Lykeas has said-in-poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]. What
Hieronymos of Kardia has written
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\], however, is
different, since a man who associates with royalty cannot help being
partial in what he writes up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-graphein</span>\]. If
Philistos had just-cause \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā
dikaiā</span>\] in suppressing the most unholy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-hosia</span>\] deeds of
Dionysius, because he expected to be restored to Syracuse from exile,
surely Hieronymos may be fully forgiven for writing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] to please
Antigonos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.14.1">

In this way did the period when the people of Epeiros reached their
zenith come-to-a-catastrophic-end
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kata-strephein</span>\].
Entering the Odeum
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ōideion</span>\], one finds
situated there, among other things that are also worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\], a figure of
Dionysus. Nearby is a fountain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\] called
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Enneakrounos</span> \[‘Nine
Streams’\]; the way it is now is the way it had been arranged
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kosmeîsthai</span>\] by
Peisistratos. Unlike the cisterns
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phreata</span>\] that are
found all over the city, this fountain is really a freshwater spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\]. Looming over
the fountain \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\]
are two shrines \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāoi</span>\].
One of them is sacred to Demeter and the Maiden
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Korē</span>\]. Inside the
other one, a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Triptolemos
has been set up. I will write down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] the things
that pertain to him \[= Triptolemos\], but I will omit whatever part of
the things-that-are-said
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] pertains to

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.14.2">

The Greeks \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\]
who dispute
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">amphisbēteîn</span>\], more
than anyone else, the claims made by the people of Athens regarding
their antiquity
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhaiotēs</span>\] and also
regarding the gifts they say they have received from the gods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\], are the people
of Argos, just as among those who are barbarians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">barbaroi</span>\] the
Egyptians compete with the Phrygians. So, it is said \[by the people of
Argos\] that when Demeter came to Argos she was received by Pelasgos
into his home \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikos</span>\],
and that Khrysanthis, knowing about the abduction
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harpagē</span>\] of the Maiden
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Korē</span>\],
related-the-story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">di-hēgeîsthai</span>\] to her.
They say that, at a later point, Trokhilos, revealer-of-the-mysteries
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierophantēs</span>\], fled
from Argos because of the enmity of Agenor, came to Attica, and married
a woman of Eleusis, by whom he had two children, Eubouleus and
Triptolemos. This is what-is-said
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] by the people
of Argos. But the people of Athens and those who inhabit Athens with
them \[…\] know that Triptolemos, son of Keleus, was the first to
sow-seed \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">speirein</span>\] for
getting cultivated grain-to-be-harvested
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">karpos</span>\].

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.14.3">

There are on one hand verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\] of Musaeus—if in
fact even these verses really belong to Musaeus—that say, in the singing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">āidesthai</span> =
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aeidesthai</span>\], that
Triptolemos is the son of Ōkeanos and Earth. There are on the other hand
verses of Orpheus—again, I do not think that these verses belong to
Orpheus—saying that Eubouleus and Triptolemos are sons of Dysaules, and
that because they made-revelations
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēnuein</span>\] to Demeter
about her daughter, she gave them as her gift the sowing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">speirein</span>\] of
grains-to-be-harvested
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">karpoi</span>\]. But
Khoirilos, an Athenian, who made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] a drama
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drâma</span>\] called
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Alopē</span>, says that Kerkyon
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">and</span> Triptolemos were
brothers, that their mother was the daughter of Amphiktyon, and that the
father of Triptolemos was Raros—while the father of Kerkyon was
Poseidon.I was getting ready to go further in connection with this
thing-that-is-said
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\], telling about
however many things the sacred-place
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] has available
for interpretation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ex-hēgēsis</span>\]—I mean,
the sacred place in Athens that is
called <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Eleusinion</span>, but a
vision \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">opsis</span>\] that
came from a dream
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oneiar</span>\] held me back.
As for things that it is divinely-allowed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hosion</span>\] to write down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] in
addressing everyone, I will turn \[implied

In front of the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\], where is also
the statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Triptolemos, is a bronze bull being led as it were to sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\], and what has
been made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pe-poíētai</span>\]
there is a seated figure of Epimenides of Knossos, who they say came to
a field \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agros</span>\],
entered a cave
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">spēlaion</span>\] there, and
fell-asleep
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koimâsthai</span>\]. The sleep
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hupnos</span>\] did not leave
him before the fortieth year, and afterwards he made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\] and purified
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kathairein</span>\] Athens and
other cities. But Thales, who stopped the plague
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nosos</span>\] for the
Lacedaemonians, was not related to Epimenides in any way, and did not
belong to the same city. The one I mentioned first was from Knossos, but
Thales was from Gortyn, according to Polymnastos of Kolophon, who
composed \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]
verses \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\] with
reference to him for the Lacedaemonians.

was coming into view for him, he reminisced
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmoneuein</span>\] not about

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\] with his poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiēsis</span>\] and with his
participation in the naval battles of Artemision and at Salamis.
Instead, he just wrote down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] \[in an

name of Marathon, after whom the plain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pedíon</span>\] called
Marathon gets its name. Also represented
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikazesthai</span>\] is
Theseus as he appeared when he was coming back up from under the earth.
Also, Athena and Hēraklēs. I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\], the people of
Marathon were the first to establish-the-custom-of-venerating
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] Hēraklēs as
a god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]. Featured
most prominently in the painting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\] are
Kallimakhos, who had been elected commander-in-chief
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polem-arkhos</span>\] by the
Athenians, and Miltiades, one of the generals
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stratēgoi</span>\]. Also
\[featured is\] a hero
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōs</span>\] called
Ekhetlos, about whom I will make mention
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] at a later
point as well.[^56]

Here are dedicated bronze shields, and some have an inscription
\[saying\] that they are taken from the Skiōnaioi and their allies,[^57]
while others, smeared with pitch lest they should be worn by age and

prisoners in the island of Sphakteria.[^58]

Here are placed bronze statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andriantes</span>\], one, in
front of the portico
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoā</span>\], of Solon, who
wrote \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] the
laws \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomoi</span>\] for the
Athenians,[^59] and, a little farther away, one of Seleukos, whose
future prosperity was foreshadowed by signs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeia</span>\] that were not
at all unclear
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aphanes</span>-\]. When he was
about to set forth from Macedonia with Alexander, and was sacrificing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] at Pella to
Zeus, the wood \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xula</span>\]
that was placed on the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] moved
all-by-itself
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">automato-</span>\] toward the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] and
caught-fire
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">haptesthai</span>\] without
the application of fire. After Alexander died, Seleukos, in fear of
Antigonos, who had arrived at Babylon, fled to Ptolemy, son of Lagos,
and then returned again to Babylon. On his return he overcame the army
of Antigonos and killed Antigonos himself, afterwards capturing
Demetrios, son of Antigonos, who had advanced with an army.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.16.2">

After these successes, which were shortly followed by the fall of
Lysimakhos, he \[= Seleukos\] entrusted to his son Antiokhos all his
empire \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] in Asia
(Minor), and himself proceeded rapidly towards Macedonia, having with
him an army both of Greeks \[Hellēnes\] and of barbarians. But Ptolemy,
brother of Lysandra, had taken refuge with him from Lysimakhos; this man
\[= Ptolemy\], who was in any case prone to be-daring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tolmân</span>\] and for this
reason was called Thunderbolt
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Keraunos</span>\],
\[accomplished quite a daring act\] when the army of Seleukos had
advanced as far as Lysimakheia: he \[= Ptolemy\] killed Seleukos by
stealth. Then he turned over to the \[other\] kings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileîs</span>\] his
possessions \[= the possessions of Seleukos\],[^60] while he \[=
Ptolemy\] ruled-as-king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\] over
Macedonia until, being as far as we know the first of the kings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileîs</span>\] to dare
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tolmân</span>\] to face the
Gauls \[Galatai\] in battle, he was killed by thesebarbarians.[^61] The
empire \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] was
restored-to-safety
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sōzesthai</span>\] by
Antigonos son of Demetrios.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.16.3">

I am persuaded that Seleukos was the most righteous
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikaios</span>\], and in
particular the most pious-in-ritual
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eu-sebēs</span>\] of the kings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">baslileîs</span>\]. For one
thing, it was Seleukos who sent-back
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kata-pempein</span>\] to
Brankhidai for the people of Miletus the bronze Apollo that had been
conveyed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-komizesthai</span>\] by
Xerxes to Ecbatana in Persia. For another thing, when he founded
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikizein</span>\] Seleukeia on
the river Tigris and brought to it Babylonians as settlers
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sunoikoi</span>\], he spared
the wall \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teikhos</span>\] of
Babylon as well as the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Bēl, near
which he permitted the Chaldaeans to settle

In the Agora \[‘Marketplace’\] of the Athenians there are things that
are not meaningful
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-sēma</span>\] to all
\[though they are meaningful to me\]. Among such things is an altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] \[sacred\] to
Pity \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Eleos</span>\]
\[personified\]. Of all the other gods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\] he \[=

helpful \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ōphelimos</span>\] in
the life \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bios</span>\]
of-humans \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpinos</span>\]
and in the vicissitudes of their affairs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pragmata</span>\], but only
the Athenians, alone among the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\], assign
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nemein</span>\] to him \[=
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Eleos</span>\] honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] \[of worship\].
And they \[= the Athenians\] have institutionalized not only those
things that pertain to love-of-humanity
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">philanthrōpiā</span>\] but
they also piously-engage-in-rituals
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eusebeîn</span>\] more than
the others. I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] they also have an
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\]
\[sacred\] to Decency

\[personified\], one to Special-Wording
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Phēmē</span>\]
\[personified\], and one to Initiative
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hormē</span>\]
\[personified\]. It is clear
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēla</span>\], visibly
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">enargōs</span>\] so, that
those who excel in piously-engaging-in-ritual

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.17.2">

Not far from the Agora is a gymnasium that is named after Ptolemy, its
founder. In this gymnasium are stone Hermai worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] and a likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] in bronze of
Ptolemy. Here also is Juba the Libyan and Khrysippos[^62] of Soloi.
Close by the gymnasium is a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Theseus,
where are paintings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\] of Athenians
battling Amazons. \[The story of\] this war
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polemos</span>\] has also been
crafted \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîsthai</span>\]
for them on the shield
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aspis</span>\] of their
\[statue of\] Athena and upon the base
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bathron</span>\] of the
\[statue of\] Olympian Zeus. There has also been painted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphesthai</span>\] in the
sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of
Theseus the battle between the Centaurs and the Lapithai. Theseus has
already killed a Centaur, but, for the others \[= the other fighters\],
the fighting is still undecided.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.17.3">

The painting \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\]
on the third wall \[of the sanctuary of Theseus\] is not clear
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">saphēs</span>\] for those who
have not inquired-about-and-learned
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">punthanesthai</span>\] what is
said \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legein</span>\]. It \[=
the lack of clarity\] is due partly to the passage of time and partly to
the fact that Mikon \[the painter\] did not paint
\[<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">graphein</span>\] the entirety of
what is said to have happened. When Minos was bringing to Crete Theseus
and the rest of the group-that-was sent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stolos</span>\], which was a
group of young-ones
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paides</span>\], he \[=
Minos\] conceived a passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erâsthai</span>\] for
Periboia, and, when Theseus opposed him with the greatest kind of
opposition \[imaginable\], he \[= Minos\] got angry and hurled insults
at him \[= Theseus\], saying that he \[= Theseus\] was not the son of
Poseidon, claiming that he \[= Theseus\] could not bring-back-to-safety
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-sōzein</span>\] for him
the signet-ring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sphrāgis</span>\] that he \[=
Minos\] happened to be wearing, if he \[= Minos\] threw it into the sea.
Saying these things, Minos is said to have thrown the signet-ring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sphrāgis</span>\], but they
say that Theseus came up \[for air\] from out of the sea holding that
signet-ring \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sphrāgis</span>\]
and holding also a gold garland
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stephanos</span>\] that
Amphitrite gave him.

With regard to the end
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teleutē</span>\] of Theseus
many things have been said, and these things are not \[mutually\]
consistent. They say he was kept tied-down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">deesthai</span>\] until he was
brought-back \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-agein</span>\]
by Hēraklēs \[to the light of day\], but, of all the things I heard, the
most believable
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pithanon</span>\] is as
follows. Theseus invaded Thesprotia to carry off the wife of the
Thesprotian king, and in this way lost the greater part of his army, and
both he and Peirithoös—he too was taking part in the expedition, being
eager for the marriage—were taken captive. The Thesprotian king kept
them tied-down \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">deein</span>\]
at Kikhyros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.17.5">

Among the things worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] at Thesprotia
are a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Zeus at
Dodona and an oak
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēgos</span>\] sacred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierā</span>\] to the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]. Near Kikhyros
is a lake called Akherousia, and a river called Akheron. There is also
Kokytos, a stream of water
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hudōr</span>\] that is
the-farthest-away-from-giving-any-pleasure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aterpestaton</span>\]. I think
it was because Homer had seen these places that he acted boldly in
putting into his poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiēsis</span>\] the things
having to do with Hadēs, and gave to the rivers there the names of those
in Thesprotia. While Theseus was thus held-back
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ekhesthai</span>\], the sons
of Tyndareus \[= the Dioskouroi\] led their armed forces against
Aphidna, captured it, and restored Menestheus to the kingship.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.17.6">

Now Menestheus took no account of the children of Theseus, who had
secretly withdrawn to Elephenor in Euboea, but he was aware that
Theseus, if ever he was-brought-back-to-safety
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-komizesthai</span>\] from
Thesprotia, would be a powerful antagonist, and so he curried favor with
the people \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\],
with the result that Theseus, when he had been
brought-back-home-to-safety
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-sōzesthai</span>\], was
expelled \[after his homecoming\]. Theseus now set-off-on-a-voyage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stellesthai</span>\] to
\[reach a man called\] Deukalion in Crete. Being carried off-course by
winds to the island of Skyros he was treated splendidly by the
inhabitants, thanks to the fame
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\] of his lineage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">genos</span>\] and to the
worthiness of his own achievements. For this very reason, Lykomedes
plotted his death. And-from-what-I-have-just-said-you-can-now-see-why
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">men dē</span>\] the Athenians
had their hero-precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēkos</span>\] \[of Theseus\].
This was after the Persians landed at Marathon. It was when Kimon, son
of Miltiades, removed the population of Skyros, thus exacting
vindication \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span>\] for
the death of Theseus, and brought-to-safety
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\] his bones to
Athens.

The sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\]
of the Dioskouroi is ancient. They themselves are represented as
standing, while their sons are seated on horses. Here Polygnotus[^63]
painted \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] the
marriage of the daughters of Leukippos, which was \[a story that was\]
pertinent to them \[= the Dioskouroi\], while Mikon painted those who
sailed with Jason to the land of Kolkhis. He \[=Mikon\] focused his
\[artistic\] effort on Akastos and the horses of Akastos.

Looming over the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of the
Dioskouroi is a sacred-precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] of Aglauros.
It was to Aglauros and her sisters, Herse and Pandrosos, that they say
Athena gave Erikhthonios, whom she had hidden in a box
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kibōtos</span>\], forbidding
them to pry curiously into what was entrusted to their charge.
Pandrosos, they say, obeyed, but the other two opened the box
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kibōtos</span>\], and went mad
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mainesthai</span>\] when they
saw Erikhthonios, and they threw themselves down the steepest part of
the Acropolis. Here it was that the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Mēdoi</span>\] climbed \[up
the Acropolis\] and killed the Athenians who thought that they
understood the oracle[^64] better than did Themistocles, and fortified
the Acropolis with logs and stakes.[^65]

Autolykos, a contestant in the pankration.[^66] And I say-this-because

As one descends from here to the lower part of the city, there is a
sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of
Serapis, whose worship the Athenians introduced from Ptolemy. Of the
Egyptian sanctuaries
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiera</span>\] of Serapis the
most famous is at Alexandria, the oldest at Memphis. Into the second of
these two neither stranger nor priest may enter, until they
make-a-funeral-for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thaptein</span>\] Apis. Not

Peirithoös and Theseus made their pact before setting forth to
Lacedaemon and afterwards to Thesprotia.

who they say came from the Hyperboreans to Delos as a helper
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">boēthoos</span>\] to Leto in
her labor; and from Delos the name spread to other populations. The
people of Delphi sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] to Eileithuia
and sing a hymn
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">humnos</span>\] of Olen. But
the Cretans customarily-think
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] that
Eileithuia was born at Amnisos in the territory of Knossos, and that
Hērā was her mother. Only among the Athenians are the wooden-figures

offerings \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\]
of Phaedra, and that the third

sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of
Olympian Zeus the Athenians say was built by Deukalion, and they show as
a sign \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeion</span>\]—that
Deukalion resided
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in Athens—a
tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] that is
not far from the present temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\].

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.18.9">

Hadrian constructed other buildings also for the Athenians: a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Hērā and Zeus
Panhellēnios \[‘belonging to all Hellenes’\], a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] that was
common \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koinon</span>\] to all
the gods, and, most famous of all, a hundred columns
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kiones</span>\] of Phrygian
marble. The walls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toikhoi</span>\] too are
constructed of the same material as the porticoes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stoai</span>\]. And there are
rooms there adorned with a gilded roof and with alabaster stone, as well
as with statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] and
paintings \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\]. In
them are kept books
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">biblia</span>\]. There is also
a gymnasium named after Hadrian; of this too the columns
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kiones</span>\] are a hundred
in number, from the Libyan quarries.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.19.1">

Close to the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Olympian Zeus
is a statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
the Pythian Apollo. There is also a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Apollo
surnamed Delphinios. They say that when the temple was finished, with
the exception of the roof, Theseus arrived in the city, unknown as yet
to everybody. When he came to the temple of the Delphinian, wearing a
tunic \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khitōn</span>\] that
reached to his feet and with his hair neatly plaited
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">plekesthai</span>\], those who
were building the roof by way of mockery
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khleuasiā</span>\] inquired
why a girl \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\]
who was in the right season
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hōrā</span>\] for getting
married was wandering around all by herself. The only answer that
Theseus made was to unyoke, it is said, the oxen from a wagon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hamaxa</span>\] close by, and
to throw it higher than the roof of the temple they were building.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.19.2">

Concerning the place
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōríon</span>\] called The
Gardens \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kēpoi</span>\], and
the temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Aphrodite, there is no word
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] about them,
nothing that is told
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legesthai</span>\]—nor about
the Aphrodite that stands near the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\]. Now the shape
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\] of it is
tetragonal, like that of the Hermai, and the inscription
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epigramma</span>\] indicates
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmainein</span>\] that
Aphrodite the celestial one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ouraniā</span>\] is the oldest
of what are called the Fates
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Moirai</span>\]. And the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Aphrodite in the Gardens
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kēpoi</span>\] is the work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] of Alkamenes.
It is one of those few things that are most worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] in Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.19.3">

There is also the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Hēraklēs,
called ‘Brightness of the Dog’ \[Kynosarges\]; the things having to do
with the bright-white
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">leukē</span>\] dog
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kuōn</span>\] may be known by
reading \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epilegesthai</span>\]
\[the pronouncement of\] the oracle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsmos</span>\]. There are
altars \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmoi</span>\] of
Hēraklēs and Hebe, who they customarily-think
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] is the
daughter of Zeus and lives with
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-oikeîn</span>\] Hēraklēs.
An altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] has
been built to Alkmene and to Iolaos, who shared-in-labors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-poneîn</span>\] with
Hēraklēs with regard to most of his deeds
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\]. The Lyceum
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Lukeion</span>\] has its name
from Lykos \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Lukos</span>\], the
son of Pandion, but it was considered sacred to Apollo from the
beginning down to my time, and here was the god first named Lykios
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Lukios</span>\]. It is said
that the Termilai also, to whom Lykos came when he fled from Aigeus,
were called Lykioi
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Lukioi</span>\] after him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.19.4">

Behind the Lyceum is a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\][^68] of Nisos,
who was killed while king of Megara by Minos, and he \[= his body\] was
conveyed \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\] by
the Athenians to this place, and he was buried here. About this Nisos
the word \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] is
that his hair was purple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">porphurai</span>\], and that
it had-to-happen
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrē-</span>\] that he would
die if it was cut off. When the Cretans attacked the land \[of Megara\],
they captured by assault the other cities of the region of Megara, but
Nisaia, where Nisos had taken refuge, they besieged. It is said that it
was here that the daughter of Nisos, conceiving a passion for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erasthēnai</span>\] Minos, cut
off her father’s hair.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.19.5">

Anyway, they say that it happened this way. As for the rivers that flow
through the land of the Athenians, they are the Ilissos and its
tributary the Eridanos, the name of which is the same as that of the
Celtic river. This Ilissos is the river by which Oreithyia was
playfully-dancing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paizein</span>\] when, as they
say, she was abducted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harpazesthai</span>\] by the
North Wind \[Boreas\]. With Oreithyia he \[= Boreas\] lived
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-oikeîn</span>\], and
because of the tie-as-in-laws
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kēdos</span>\] between him and
the Athenians he helped them by destroying most of the barbarians’
warships \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">triēreis</span>\].
The Athenians concede that the Ilissos is sacred to other deities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\] as well, and on
its banks is an altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of the Muses of
Ilissos. The place too is pointed out
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">deiknusthai</span>\] where the
Peloponnesians killed Kodros, son of Melanthos and king of Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.19.6">

Across the Ilissos is a place
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōríon</span>\] called Agrai
and a temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Artemis <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Agroterā</span>. They
say that Artemis first hunted here when she came from Delos, and for
this reason the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] holds a bow
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toxon</span>\]. A marvel
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thauma</span>\] to the eyes,
though not so conducive
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epagōgon</span>\] to hear of,
is a race-course
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stadion</span>\] of white
marble, the size of which can best be estimated from the fact that
beginning in a crescent on the heights above the Ilissos it descends in
two straight lines to the river banks. This was built by Herodes, an
Athenian, and the greater part of the Pentelic quarry was used up in its
construction.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.20.1">

Leading from the Prytaneion \[‘City Hall’\] is a road called Tripods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Tripodes</span>\]. The place
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōríon</span>\] takes its
name from the shrines
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāoi</span>\], large enough to
hold the tripods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tripodes</span>\] that stand
upon them, of bronze, and containing works of artisanship that are most
worthy of remembering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\], including a
Satyr, of which Praxiteles is said to have thought-of
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phroneîn</span>\] very highly.
Once upon a time, Phryne asked him which of his works
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\] was the most
beautiful of them all, and they say that he agreed to give that one as a
gift \[to her\], but he refused to say which of his works appeared to
him to be the most beautiful of them all. Well, a slave of Phryne rushed
up to Praxiteles saying that a fire had broken out in his building and
that the greater number of his works
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\] were lost,
though not all were destroyed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.20.2">

Praxiteles at once started to rush out the door saying that his labor
was all lost if in fact the fire
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phlox</span>\] had caught his
Satyr and his Love \[Eros\]. But Phryne ordered him to stay and be of
good courage, for he had suffered no grievous loss, but had been trapped
into confessing which were the most beautiful of his works. So, Phryne
chose the statue of Love \[Eros\]; meanwhile, a Satyr is in the temple
of Dionysus close by—a boy holding out a cup. The Love \[Eros\] standing
with him and the Dionysus were made by Thymilos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.20.3">

The oldest sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Dionysus is
near the theater. Within the enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\] are two
temples \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāoi</span>\] and two
statues of Dionysus, the Eleuthereus \[‘Deliverer’\] and the one that
Alkamenes made of ivory and gold. There are paintings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\] here. One of
them shows Dionysus bringing up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-agein</span>\] Hephaistos
to the sky \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\].
And the following things are also said about this by the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\]: Hephaistos,
when he was born, was thrown down by Hērā. In revenge, he sent to her as
a gift a golden throne
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thronos</span>\] with
invisible bonds
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">desmoi</span>\]. When Hērā sat
down she was held bound, and Hephaistos refused to listen to any other
of the gods except for Dionysus—in him he placed the fullest trust—and
after making him drunk Dionysus brought him to the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\]. Also painted
\[on the wall painting\] are Pentheus and Lycurgus (Lukourgos) paying
the penalty \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span>\] for
having committed-outrage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hubrizein</span>\] against
Dionysus; also Ariadne, asleep; Theseus, departing by sea; and Dionysus,
arriving to abduct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harpazein</span>\] Ariadne.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.20.4">

Near the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Dionysus
and the theater is a structure that is said to be a replica
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mīmēsis</span>\] of the tent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skēnē</span>\] of Xerxes. It
has been rebuilt, for the old building was burned down by the Roman
general \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stratēgos</span>\]
Sulla when he captured Athens.[^69] The cause
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\] of the war was
this. Mithridates was king over the barbarians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">barbaroi</span>\] around the
Black Sea \[<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Pontos Euxeinos</span>\].
Now his pretext
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prophasis</span>\] for making
war against the Romans, and how he crossed into Asia \[Minor\], and what
cities he took by force of arms or made his friends, I must leave for
those to find out who wish to know the things concerning Mithridates.
What I will highlight here is the capture of Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.20.5">

There was an Athenian, Aristion, whom Mithridates used as his envoy to
the Greek \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnides</span>\]
cities. He persuaded the Athenians to join Mithridates rather than the
Romans, although he did not persuade all, but only the common-people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] and, in
particular, the most turbulent part of the common-people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\]. But those
Athenians who were of any account
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] fled to the
Romans of their own accord. In the engagement that followed, the Romans
won a decisive victory; Aristion and the Athenians fled and were pursued
right into the city \[of Athens itself\], while Arkhelaos and the
barbarians were pursued right into the \[harbor city of\] Peiraieus.
This Arkhelaos was another general of Mithridates, whom earlier than
this the Magnesians who inhabit
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] the region of
Mount Sipylos wounded when he raided their territory, killing most of
the barbarians as well. So, Athens was besieged.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.20.6">

Taxilos, a general
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stratēgos</span>\] of
Mithridates, was at the time besieging Elateia in Phokis, but, on
receiving the news, he withdrew his troops towards Attica. Learning
this, the general
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stratēgos</span>\] of the
Romans entrusted the siege of Athens to a portion of his army, and with
the greater part of his forces advanced in person to engage Taxilos in
Boeotia. On the third day from this, news came to both the Roman armies;
Sulla heard that the Athenian fortifications had been breached, and the
besieging force learned that Taxilos had been defeated in battle near
Khairōneia. When Sulla returned to Attica he rounded up inside the
Kerameikos the Athenians who had opposed him, and one chosen by lot out
of every ten he ordered to be led to execution.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.20.7">

Sulla did not relent in his anger against the Athenians, and so a few
who managed to escape to Delphi inquired there whether the time had now
come when it was fated for even Athens to become a deserted place. The
Pythia said-in-an-oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrē-</span>\]
the-things-having-to-do-with the ‘wine-skin’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">askos</span>\]. Afterwards,
Sulla was afflicted with that disease
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nosos</span>\], which I learn
also afflicted Pherecydes of Syros. Although Sulla treated the Athenian
people in a way that was so savage as to be unseemly for a Roman, I do
not think that this was the cause
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\] of his
misfortune \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sumphorā</span>\].
What caused it, rather, was I think the cosmic-anger
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēnīma</span>\] of the
Lord-of-Suppliants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hikesios</span>\], for he \[=
Sulla\] had dragged Aristion from the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Athena,
where he had sought asylum, and killed him. Thus was Athens afflicted by
the war with Rome, but it blossomed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">antheîn</span>\] again when
Hadrian was-‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.21.1">

In the theater the Athenians have portrait-statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] of the poets
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiētai</span>\] of tragedy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tragōidiā</span>\] and comedy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmōidiā</span>\], but they
\[= the statues\] are mostly of undistinguished persons. With the
exception of Menander no poet
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiētēs</span>\] of comedy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmōidiā</span>\] represented
here won a reputation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\], but tragedy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tragōidiā</span>\] has two
illustrious representatives, Euripides and Sophocles. It is said that
after the death of Sophocles, when the Lacedaemonians invaded Attica,
their commander saw in a vision Dionysus, who ordered him to honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmân</span>\], with all the
customary honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] of the dead,
the new Siren \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Seirēn</span>\].
It seemed to him that the dream
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">onar</span>\] referred to
Sophocles and his poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiēsis</span>\], and down to
the present day people are used to liken to a Siren whatever is
enchanting \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epagōgon</span>\]
in both poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiēmata</span>\] and prose
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.21.2">

The likeness \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of
Aeschylus is, I think, much later than his death and than the painting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\] of the action
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] at Marathon.
Here is what Aeschylus himself said: that, when he was a young-man
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">meirakion</span>\] and he once
fell asleep while he was guarding the grapes in a vineyard, Dionysus
appeared to him and ordered him to make
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] tragedy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tragōidiā</span>\]. When day
came, in obedience to the vision, he made an attempt and started to
compose \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] with
the greatest of ease.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.21.3">

These are the things that he \[= Aeschylus\] said. On the South Wall
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teikhos</span>\], as it is
called, of the Acropolis, which faces the theater, there is dedicated a
gilded head of Medusa the Gorgon, and around it is crafted an aegis
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aigis</span>\]. Looming over
the theater is a grotto
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">spēlaion</span>\] in the rocks
under the Acropolis. This also has a tripod standing over it. In it are
\[likenesses of\] Apollo and Artemis slaying the children of Niobe. This
Niobe I myself saw when I went up to the mountain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oros</span>\] called Sipylos.
When one is close by, it is a rock
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">petrā</span>\], a steep crag
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēmnos</span>\], showing not
at all the shape
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\] of a woman who
is lamenting \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pentheîn</span>\]
or the like; but if one gets further away from it one will think one is
seeing a woman shedding-tears
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dakruein</span>\],
with-sunken-eyes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katēphēs</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.21.4">

On the way to the Athenian Acropolis from the theater is the tomb of
Kálōs. Daidalos killed this Kálōs, who was his sister’s son and a
learner of the craft
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnē</span>\]. Because of
this he fled to Crete; afterwards he ran off to the residence of Kokalos
in Sicily. The sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Asklepios
is worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] both for its
paintings \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\] and
for the statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of the god
and his children. In it there is a spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\], at which they
say that Poseidon’s son Halirrhothios ravished Alkippe the daughter of
Ares, who killed the ravisher and was the first to be put on trial
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span>\]
in-compensation-for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi</span> + dative\] the
killing \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phonos</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.21.5">

Among the votive offerings there is a breastplate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thōrax</span>\] originating
from the people known as the Sauromatai. On seeing this, one will say
that no less than Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] are
barbarians skilled in the arts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnai</span>\]. I say this
for the following reasons. The Sauromatai have no iron, neither mined by
themselves nor yet imported. They have, in fact, no dealings at all with
the \[other\] barbarians who inhabit the places surrounding them. To
meet this deficiency they have invented things
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ex-heuriskein</span>\]. In
place of iron they use bone for their spear-blades, and cornel-wood for
the bows \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toxa</span>\] from
which they shoot arrows, with bone points for the arrows. They throw a

horses, they up-end the enemy caught in the lasso.

Their breastplates
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thōrakes</span>\] they make in
the following way. Each man keeps many mares, since the land is not
divided \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">merizein</span>\] into
allotments \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">klēroi</span>\],
nor does it bear anything except wild trees, as the people are nomads.
These mares they not only use for war, but they also sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] them to the
local \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōroioi</span>\]
gods \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\] and eat
them for food. Their hooves they collect, clean, split, and make from
them as it were scales of serpents
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakontes</span>\]. Whoever
has never seen a serpent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakōn</span>\] must at least
have seen a pine-cone still green. He will not be mistaken if he likens
the product from the hoof to the segments that are seen on the
pine-cone. These pieces they bore and stitch together with the sinews of
horses and oxen, and then use them as breastplates
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thōrakes</span>\] that are as
beautiful and strong as those of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\]. For they
can withstand blows of missiles or when struck in close combat.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.21.7">

Linen breastplates
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thōrakes</span>\] are not so
useful to those fighting in battles, for they let the iron pass through,
if the blow be a violent one. They aid hunters, however, for the teeth
of lions or leopards break off in them. One may see linen breastplates
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thōrakes</span>\] dedicated in
other sanctuaries
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiera</span>\], notably in the
one at Gryneion, where is found a most beautiful grove
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">alsos</span>\] of Apollo, with
cultivated trees, and all those other kinds of trees that, although they
bear no fruit, are pleasing to smell or look at.

Moving past the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Asklepios,
as one goes along this way toward the Acropolis, there is a shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Themis. In
front of it, heaped-up-as-a-tumulus
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kekhōstai</span>\], is a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\][^70] for
Hippolytus. The end of his life, they say, came from curses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katārai</span>\]. Everybody,
even a barbarian who has learned the language of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\], knows about
the erotic-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\] of Phaedra and
about the wickedness that her nurse
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">trophos</span>\] dared to
commit as her servant. The people of Troizen also \[= just as the
Athenians\] have a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\][^71] of
Hippolytus, and their story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] about it is as
follows.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.22.2">

When Theseus was about to marry Phaedra, he did not wish, in case he had
children, for Hippolytus either to be ruled by them or for Hippolytus to
be king \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\]
instead of them, and so he sent him \[= Hippolytus\] to Pittheus \[in
Troizen\] to be raised there to become the future king of Troizen.
Sometime later, Pallas and his sons rebelled against Theseus. After
killing them he \[= Theseus\] went to Troizen for purification
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katharsia</span>\], and
Phaedra first saw Hippolytus there.[^72] Conceiving-a-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erasthēnai</span>\] for him
she made-contrivances
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleuein</span>\] that
resulted in death.[^73] The people in Troizen have a myrtle-bush
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mursinē</span>\][^74] that has
every one of its leaves pricked with holes; they say that it did not
grow originally in this way, the holes being the result-created
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] by two causes.
One was the saturation-of-longing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">asē</span>\] that she felt in
her erotic-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\] and the other
was the pin \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peronē</span>\]
that Phaedra wore in her hair.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.22.3">

When Theseus had united into one state
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] the many
Athenian demes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmoi</span>\],
he established the custom of worshipping
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sebesthai</span>\] Aphrodite,
surnamed ‘common to every district’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Pan-dēmos</span>\] and
\[worshipping also\] Persuasion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Peithō</span>\]. The old
statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] no
longer existed in my time, but those I saw were the work of no inferior
artisans \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnītai</span>\].
There is also a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Earth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Gē</span>\] \[who has the
epithet\] <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kourotrophos</span>
\[‘nurturing the young’\] and of Demeter \[who has the epithet\] Chloe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Khloē</span> ‘burst of
green’\]. One can learn all about their epithets
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epōnumiai</span>\] by getting
into conversations
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\] with the
priests \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereis</span>\].

There is only one entrance to the Acropolis. It affords no other, being
precipitous all around and having a strong wall. The Gateway
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Propulaia / Propylaea</span>\]
has a roof of white marble, and down to the present day it is unrivalled
for the arrangement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kosmos</span>\] and size of
its stones. Now as to the likenessess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] of the
horsemen \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hippeis</span>\], I
cannot tell for certain whether they are the sons of Xenophon or whether
they were made merely for their good looks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">euprepeia</span>\]. On the
right of the Gateway \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Propulaia
/ Propylaea</span>\] is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Wingless
Nike. From this point the sea is visible, and here it was, so they say,
that Aigeus threw himself down to his death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.22.5">

I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] the ship that
carried the young people to Crete began its voyage with black sails; but
Theseus, who was sailing off on his daring-adventure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tolmē</span>\] against the
bull of Minos, so it is called, had told his father beforehand that he
would use white sails if he should sail back victorious over the bull.
But he had a memory-loss
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lēthē</span>\] of these things
after Ariadne was taken from him. So, Aigeus, when from this
vantage-point he saw the vessel carried along
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] by black
sails, thinking that his son was dead, threw himself down to
destruction. There is in Athens a hero-shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\] that is named
as belonging to Aigeus.

On the left of the Gateway
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Propulaia / Propylaea</span>\]
is a building \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma</span>\]
that houses paintings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\]. Among those
not effaced by time there was Diomedes taking the \[statue of\] Athena
from Troy, and Odysseus in Lemnos taking away the bow
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toxon</span>\] of Philoctetes.
There in the paintings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\] is Orestes
killing Aigisthos, and Pylades killing the sons of Nauplios, who had
come as helpers
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">boēthooi</span>\] for
Aigisthos. And there is Polyxena about to be slaughtered
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sphazesthai</span>\] near the
tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of
Achilles. Homer did well in bypassing this deed, which is so
raw-in-its-cruelty
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ōmon</span>\]. And I think he
also did well in making
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] Achilles
capture Skyros, differing entirely from those who say that Achilles had
a life-experience
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">diaita</span>\] in Skyros
together with the maidens there, as Polygnotus has pictured-in-painting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\]. He \[=
Polygnotus\] also painted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] Odysseus
happening upon the girls washing clothes with Nausikaa at the river,
just like what Homer made-in-poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]. There are
also other paintings, including one that features Alcibiades,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.22.7">

and in that painting are signs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeia</span>\] indicating the
victory \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nīkē</span>\] his
horses won at Nemeā. There is also Perseus returning
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] to
Seriphos and carrying to Polydektes the head of Medusa. As for things
having to do with Medusa I am not inclined
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prothūmos</span>\] to
give-indications
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmainein</span>\] in my
account \[here\] about Attica. Included among the paintings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\]—I omit the
boy carrying the water-jars
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hudriai</span>\] and the
wrestler of Timainetos[^75]—is Musaeus. I have read
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epilegesthai</span>\] verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\] in which Musaeus
receives from the North Wind \[Boreas\] the gift of flight, but, in my
opinion, Onomacritus made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] these
\[verses\], and there is nothing that is verifiably by Musaeus except
for a hymn \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">humnos</span>\] to
Demeter, \[composed\] for the Lykomidai.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.22.8">

Right at the very entrance to the Acropolis \[at the Propulaia /
Propylaea\] are (1) a Hermes called Hermes of the Propulaia
\[/Propylaea\] and (2) \[statues of\] the Graces
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kharites</span>\]. These they
say were made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]
by Socrates, the son of Sophroniskos. The Pythia was witness to his
being the wisest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sophōtatos</span>\] of humans.
She refused to address in the same way Anakharsis, although he really
wanted it to happen, and that is why he had come to Delphi.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.23.1">

Among the things the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] say is that
there were Seven Wise
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Sophoi</span>\] Men. Two of
them were the tyrant
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannos</span>\] \[Pittakos\]
of Lesbos and Periandros \[of Corinth\] the son of Kypselos. And yet
Peisistratos and his son Hippias were more humane
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">philanthrōpoi</span>\] than
Periandros, also more skilled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sophoi</span>\] in warfare and
in the proper-arrangement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kosmos</span>\] of citizens
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polītai</span>\], until, on
account of the murder of Hipparkhos, Hippias went the other way as he
yielded to his anger
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thūmos</span>\], especially
with regard to a woman whose name was Leaina \[meaning ‘Lioness’\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.23.2">

What I am about to say has never before been committed to a
\[historical\] write-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sungraphē</span>\], but it is
generally given credence by most Athenians. When Hipparkhos died,
Hippias subjected Leaina to degradations that led to her death, because
he understood that she was the mistress
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hetaira</span>\] of
Aristogeiton and therefore could not possibly, he thought, be in
ignorance of the plot
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleuma</span>\]. In
compensation, when the tyranny
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannis</span>\] of the
Peisistratidai was brought to an end, the Athenians set up a bronze
\[statue of a\] lioness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">leaina</span>\] in memory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] of the woman.
The statue was a dedication initiated by Kallias, and the work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] \[on the
statue\] was done by Kalamis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.23.3">

Close by is a bronze statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andrias</span>\] of Diitrephes
shot through by arrows.[^76] Among the things accomplished by this
Diitrephes as reported by the Athenians is his leading back home the
Thracian mercenaries who arrived too late to take part in the expedition
of Demosthenes against Syracuse. He also made a landing at
Euripos-at-Khalkis, where the Boeotians had an inland town Mykalessos,
marched up to this town from the coast, and captured it. Of the
inhabitants the Thracians killed not only the combatants but also the
women and children. There is-evidence
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">martureîn</span>\] for me \[to
cite\]. All the Boeotian cities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poleis</span>\] that the
Thebans captured were inhabited
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîsthai</span>\] in my
time, since the people escaped just before the capture. So, if the
barbarians had not killed off the people of Mykalessos the survivors
would have afterwards reoccupied the city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.23.4">

It was such a great wonder
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thauma</span>\] for me to see
the likeness \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of
Diitrephes pierced with arrows. I say this because the only Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] for whom it
is a local-thing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrion</span>\] to
use-bow-and-arrows
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toxeuein</span>\] are the
Cretans. After all, the men of Opountian Lokris, whom Homer made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] to be carrying
bows \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toxa</span>\] and slings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sphendonai</span>\] when they
came to Ilion \[= Troy\], we know were-armed-as-heavy-infantry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hoplīteuein</span>\] by the
time of the Persian wars. Nor for that matter did the Malians continue
the practice \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">meletē</span>\]
of using bow-and-arrows
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toxa</span>\]; even more, I
think that they did not know it before the time of Philoctetes, and they
gave it up soon after. Near the Diitrephes—I do not wish to write down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] the less
distinguished likenesses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\]—are statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of gods; of
Hygieia, who they say is the daughter of Asklepios, and of Athena, who
also has this name Hygieia by way of epithet
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\].

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.23.5">

There is also a stone
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lithos</span>\], not very big
but just large enough to serve as a seat for a little man. On it they
say Silenos rested when Dionysus came to the land. I-say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] the oldest of the
Satyrs they call Silenoi. Wishing to know better than most people who
the Satyrs are, I got into conversations
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\] with many about
this very matter. Euphemos, a man from Caria, said that on a voyage to
Italy he was driven off-course by winds and was carried into the outer
sea, beyond the trajectory of seamen. He affirmed that there were many
uninhabited islands while others were inhabited
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] by wild
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agrioi</span>\] men. The
sailors did not wish to make a landing at the second islands,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.23.6">

because, having made a landing before, they had some experience of the
inhabitants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">enoikoûntes</span>\], but on
this occasion they would have to be violently-forced
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">biasthênai</span>\] \[to make
a landing\]. The islands were called Satyrides by the sailors, and the
inhabitants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">enoikoûntas</span>\] were
rustic, and had upon their flanks tails not much smaller than those of
horses. As soon as they noticed their visitors, they ran down to the
ship without a shout and assaulted the women in the ship. To end it all,
the sailors in fear tossed over \[to them\] on the island a barbarian
woman, whom the Satyrs outraged
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hubrizein</span>\] not only in
the usual way, but also all over her body.

Having viewed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theâsthai</span>\] other
things also on the Athenian Acropolis, I know them. There is a bronze
boy holding the sprinkler
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peri-rrhantērion</span>\], by
Lykios son of Myron. And there is Myron’s Perseus, \[shown\] right after
having just done
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergazesthai</span>\] the Deed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] with regard to
Medusa. There is also a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Artemis
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Braurōniā</span>; the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is the work of
Praxiteles, and the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\]
derives her name from the deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] of Brauron. The
old wooden-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] is in Brauron,
the Artemis in-Tauroi

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēkhanēma</span>\] to make a
breach in the Trojan wall is known to everybody who does not attribute
utter credulity to the Phrygians \[= the Trojans\]. But it is said about
that horse that it contained the best
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aristoi</span>\] of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\], and the
figuring \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\] of
the bronze fits in well with what is said about it. Menestheus and
Teukros are peeping out of it, and so too are the sons of Theseus.

Of the statues

who perfected the footrace-in-armor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hoplītodrameîn</span>\] was
made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] by
Kritios, while the credit goes to Oinobios for the fine work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] with regard to
\[the likeness of\] Thucydides the son of Oloros.[^77] Oinobios had
succeeded in getting a decree
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">psēphisma</span>\] passed for
the return of Thucydides to Athens, but he was treacherously murdered as
he was returning, and there is a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\][^78] for him
not far from the gate known as the Melitides.

Things to be said with regard to Hermolykos, who competed in the
pankration, also with regard to Phormion,[^79] the son of Asopikhos, I
omit, since others have written down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] those
things. About Phormion, however, I have one further thing to write down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\]. Quite one
of the best men in Athens and distinguished for the fame
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\] of his
ancestors, he happened to be heavily in debt. So, he withdrew to the
deme \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] Paiania
and lived there until the Athenians elected him to command a naval
expedition. But he refused the office on the grounds that before his
debts were discharged he lacked the mind-set
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phronēma</span>\] to face his
troops. So, the Athenians, who were absolutely determined to have
Phormion as commander, paid all his creditors.

Theseus with the so-called Bull of Minos, whether this was a man or a
beast of the kind he is said to have been in the prevalent story. I say
it this way because even in our time women have given birth to
monstrosities \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">terata</span>\]
that are far more-wondrous
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thaumasiōtera</span>\] than
this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.24.2">

There is also set up a \[statue of\] Phrixos the son of Athamas, carried
ashore to the land of Kolkhis by the ram. Having sacrificed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] it \[= the
ram\] to some god or other, presumably to the one called Laphystios by
the people of Orkhomenos, he has cut out the thighs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēroi</span>\] in accordance
with the custom \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomos</span>\]
of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] and is
watching them as they burn. Next are set up other likenesses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\], including
one of Hēraklēs strangling the serpents
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakontes</span>\], as the
story \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] has it.
There is Athena too coming up out of the head of Zeus, and also a bull
dedicated by the Council of the Areiopagos on some occasion or other,
about which one could, if one wanted to, say- many different
-likely-things
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikazein</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.24.3">

I have already said earlier that the Athenians, far more than other
people, share in a zeal
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">spoudē</span>\] for
that-which-is-divine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theion</span>\]. They were the
first to surname
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epοnomazein</span>\] Athena as
Erganē \[= patroness of
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span> ‘work’\]; they were
the first to set up limbless Hermai; and the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] \[of their
goddess\] is shared by a Daimōn \[‘superhuman force’\] of zealous-ones
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">spoudaioi</span>\].[^80]
Whoever prefers things that have been made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîsthai</span>\] with
artistry \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnē</span>\] to
mere antiquity
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhaiotēs</span>\], such a
person may have the following things to view
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theâsthai</span>\]: a man
wearing a helmet, by Kleoitas, whose nails the artist has made of
silver, and a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Earth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Gē</span>\] imploring Zeus to
rain upon her; perhaps the Athenians themselves needed downpourings \[of
rain\], or maybe all the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] had been
plagued with a drought. There also are set up Timotheus the son of Konon
and Konon himself; Procne too, who has already made up her mind about
the boy, and Itys as well—a group dedicated by Alkamenes. There has also
been made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîsthai</span>\]
an Athena displaying her olive-plant
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phuton</span>\], and Poseidon
displaying his wave
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kūma</span>\];

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.24.4">

also, there is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus, one
made by Leokhares[^81] and another one called Polieus \[‘of the city’\],
the traditions
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kathestēkota</span>\] for
sacrificing \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\] to
whom I will write down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] without
writing down \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\]
the reason \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\] for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi</span> + dative\] these
\[traditions\]. Upon the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of Zeus Polieus
they place barley mixed with wheat and leave it unguarded. The ox, which
they keep already prepared for sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\], goes to the
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] and makes
contact \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">haptesthai</span>\]
with the grain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">spermata</span>\]. One of the
priests \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereis</span>\] they
call the ox-slayer
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouphonos</span>\], and he
kills the ox; then, casting aside the axe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pelekus</span>\] at that spot,
according to the ritual
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomos</span>\], he runs away.
The others bring the axe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pelekus</span>\] to trial
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span>\], as if they did
not know the man who did
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\] the deed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.24.5">

They do \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\] these
things as I have just said they do them. And now, as one enters the
temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] that they
name the Parthenon, all the details that have been put into what is
called the \[east\] pediment
\[<span custom-style="chs_foreign_emphasis">aetos</span>\] show the
birth \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">genesis</span>\] of
Athena, but on the rear \[= west\] pediment there is the strife
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eris</span>\] between Athena
and Poseidon over the ownership of the land \[of Athens\]. As for the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] \[of
the goddess\] itself, it is made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîsthai</span>\] of ivory
and gold. On the middle of her helmet
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kranos</span>\] is placed a
likeness \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of the
Sphinx—the things that are said of the Sphinx I will write down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] when my
discourse \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] moves
ahead to things having to do with Boeotia—and on either side of the
helmet \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kranos</span>\] are
griffins \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">grupes</span>\] in
relief.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.24.6">

These griffins, Aristeas[^82] of Prokonnesos says in his verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\], fight for the
gold with the Arimaspoi beyond the Issedones. The gold that the griffins
guard, he says, comes out of the earth; the Arimaspoi are men all born
with one eye; griffins are beasts like lions, but with the beak and
wings of an eagle. I will say no more about the griffins.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.24.7">

The statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Athena is standing \[not seated\], with a tunic
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khitōn</span>\] reaching to
the feet, and on her breast the head of Medusa is worked in ivory. She
holds a \[statue of\] Nike about four cubits high, and in the other hand
a spear \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doru</span>\]; at her
feet is placed a shield
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aspis</span>\] and near the
spear \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doru</span>\] is a
serpent \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakōn</span>\]. This
serpent \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakōn</span>\] would
be Erikhthonios. On the pedestal of the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is the birth
of Pandora in relief. It has been said-in-poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîsthai</span>\] by Hesiod
and others that this Pandora was the first woman; before Pandora was
born there was as yet no womankind. And there, as I know because I saw
it, is a portrait-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian—it
is the only one there, but at the entrance there is one \[= a
portrait-statue\] of Iphikrates,[^83] who
accomplished-for-public-display
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apodeiknusthai</span>\] many
wondrous \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thaumasta</span>\]
deeds.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.24.8">

Beyond the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] is a bronze
Apollo, and it is said that Pheidias made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]. They call it
the Locust God
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Parnopios</span>\], because
once when locusts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parnopes</span>\] were
devastating the land the god said that he would drive them from Attica.
That he did drive them away they know, but they do not say how. I myself
know that locusts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parnopes</span>\] have been
destroyed three times in the past on Mount Sipylos, and not in the same
way. Once a gale arose and swept them away; on another occasion violent
heat came on after rain and destroyed them; the third time, sudden cold
caught them and they died.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.1">

Such were the things I saw happening to the locusts. On the Athenian
Acropolis is a \[statue of\] Pericles, the son of Xanthippos, and one of
Xanthippos himself, who fought against the Persians at the naval battle
of Mykale.[^84] But the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andrias</span>\] of Pericles
stands apart, while near Xanthippos stands \[a statue of\] Anacreon of
Teos, the first poet after Sappho of Lesbos to compose
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] love poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōtika</span>\] as the major
part of what he wrote
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\], and his
posture \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\] is as
it were that of a man singing in a state of intoxication
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">methē</span>\].
Deinomenes[^85] has made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] the two female
figures which stand near, Io, the daughter of Inakhos, and Kallisto, the
daughter of Lykaon, about both of whom there are similar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">homoia</span>\] stories
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">diēgēmata</span>\]:
erotic-passion \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\]
of Zeus, wrath \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">orgē</span>\]
of Hērā, and metamorphosis
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">allagē</span>\]—Io becoming a
cow and Kallisto, a bear.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.2">

At the south wall is \[represented\] the war they say was fought with
the giants \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gigantes</span>\],
who once dwelled about Thrace and on the isthmus of Pallene, also the
battle \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">makhē</span>\] between
the Athenians and the Amazons, also the deed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] accomplished
against the Persians at Marathon, also the destruction of the Gauls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Galatai</span>\] in
Mysia.[^86] Each is about two cubits, and all were dedicated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anatithenai</span>\] by
Attalos. There stands too Olympiodoros, who won fame
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\] for the
greatness of his achievements, especially in the crisis when he
displayed a brave confidence among men who had met with continuous
reverses and were therefore in despair of winning a single success in
the days to come.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.3">

For the disaster at Khairōneia[^87] was the beginning of misfortune for
all the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\], and
especially did it turn into slaves
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">douloi</span>\] those who had
been blind to the danger and such as had sided with Macedon. Most of
their cities Philip captured; with Athens he nominally came to terms,
but really imposed the severest penalties upon it, taking away the
islands and putting an end to its empire
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] at sea. For a
time the Athenians remained passive, during the reign of Philip and
subsequently of Alexander. But when on the death of Alexander the
Macedonians chose Aridaios to be their king, though the whole empire
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] had been
entrusted to Antipatros, the Athenians now thought it intolerable if
Greece \[Hellas\] should be forever under the Macedonians, and
themselves embarked on war besides inciting others to join them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.4">

The cities \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poleis</span>\]
that took part were, of the Peloponnesians, Argos, Epidauros, Sikyon,
Troizen, the people of Elis, the Phliasians, Messene; on the other side
of the Corinthian Isthmus the people of Lokris, the people of Phokis,
the Thessalians, Karystos, the Acarnanians belonging to the Aetolian
League. The Boeotians, who occupied
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nemesthai</span>\] the
territory of Thebes now that there were no Thebans left to dwell there,
in fear that the Athenians would injure them by founding-a-settlement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epoikizein</span>\] on the
site of Thebes, refused to join the alliance and lent all their forces
to furthering the Macedonian cause.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.5">

The armed forces under the alliance had their own generals
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stratēgoi</span>\] from each
city, but the Athenian Leosthenes was chosen to command all of them,
both because of the prestige
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">axiōma</span>\] of his city
and also because he had the reputation of being an experienced soldier.
He had already proved himself a general benefactor of all Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\]. All those
of them who were serving as mercenaries in the armies of Darius and his
satraps Alexander had wished to deport to Persia, but Leosthenes was too
quick for him, and he brought
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\] them by sea
to Europe. On this occasion too he accomplished
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apodeiknusthai</span>\]
brilliant deeds \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\],
true to expectation, and so his death produced a general despair that
was chiefly responsible for the defeat. A Macedonian garrison
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phrourā</span>\] was set over
the Athenians, and it occupied first Mounukhia and afterwards Peiraieus
also and the Long Walls.[^88]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.6">

On the death of Antipatros Olympias came over from Epeiros, killed
Aridaios, and for a time was-the-ruler
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhein</span>\]; but shortly
afterwards she was besieged by Kassandros, captured, and handed over to
the people \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">plēthos</span>\].
As for Kassandros and his rule-as-king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\], my
account \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] will
deal only with what is relevant to the Athenians. He seized the fort of
Panakton in Attica, also Salamis, and he established as tyrant in Athens
Demetrios the son of Phanostratos, a man who had won a reputation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\] for wisdom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sophiā</span>\]. The
tyrrannical-régime
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannis</span>\] of this man
was terminated by Demetrios the son of Antigonos, a young man who was
ambitiously
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">philotīmōs</span>\] disposed
to promote Hellenism \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò
Hellēnikon</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.7">

Meanwhile Kassandros, who had an underlying hatred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mīsos</span>\] for the
Athenians, cultivated Lakhares, who up to now had been a champion of the
people \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\], and
persuaded him to undertake a plot to achieve a tyrannical-régime
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannis</span>\]. Of all the
tyrants \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannoi</span>\] we
know of, no régime of any of them was so cruel to humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\] and so
uncaring toward what is divine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò theion</span>\]. Although
Demetrios the son of Antigonos had his differences with the populace
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] of the
Athenians, he nevertheless deposed Lakhares from his tyranny
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannis</span>\], who, on the
capture of the fortifications, escaped to Boeotia. Lakhares took golden
shields \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aspides</span>\] from
the Acropolis, and stripped even the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Athena of
its removable ornamentation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kosmos</span>\]; he was
accordingly suspected of being a very wealthy man,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.25.8">

and was murdered by some men of Κorōneia for the sake of this wealth.
After freeing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eleutheroûn</span>\] the
Athenians from tyrants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannoi</span>\] Demetrios
the son of Antigonos did not restore the Peiraieus to them immediately
after the flight of Lakhares, but subsequently overcame them and brought
a garrison \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phrourā</span>\]
even into the upper city, fortifying the place called the Place of the
Muses \[Mouseion / Museum\]. This is a hill right opposite the Acropolis
within the ancient enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\] \[of the
city\] where they say Musaeus
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Mousaios</span> ‘Man of the
Muses’\] used to sing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">āidein</span>\], and, dying of
old age, was buried. Afterwards a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] also was built
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikodomeîn</span>\] here for a
Syrian. At the time to which I refer Demetrios fortified and held it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.26.1">

But, later on, a few men brought back to mind
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] their
forefathers \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">progonoi</span>\],
and what a transformation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">metabolē</span>\] of the
ancient prestige
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">axiōma</span>\] of the
Athenians had come to pass. Then, just like that, they went ahead and
elected Olympiodoros to be their general
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stratēgos</span>\]. He led
them, both the old men and the young, against the Macedonians,[^89]
hoping for military success by trusting more in their zeal
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prothūmiā</span>\] than in
their strength \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">rhōmē</span>\].
The Macedonians came out to engage him, but he overcame them, pursued
them to the Place of the Muses \[Mouseion / Museum\], and captured the
position.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.26.2">

So Athens was freed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eleutheroûsthai</span>\] from
the Macedonians, and though all the Athenians did engage-in-the-struggle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōnizesthai</span>\] in a way
that is worthy of recording, Leokritos the son of Protarkhos is said to
have displayed the greatest boldness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tolmē</span>\] in facing the
deed-to-be-done
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\]. For he was the
first to scale the fortification for the Place of the Muses \[Mouseion /
Museum\], and the first to rush inside; and when he fell fighting, the
Athenians paid him great honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\], and they even
dedicated his shield
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aspis</span>\] to Zeus
Eleutherios \[‘of Freedom’\] and inscribed on it the name of Leokritos
and his success.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.26.3">

This is the greatest deed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] of
Olympiodoros, aside from other accomplishments, which include his
recovering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anasōzesthai</span>\]
Peiraieus and Mounukhia; and again, when the Macedonians were raiding
Eleusis he collected a force of Eleusinians and defeated the invaders.
Still earlier than this, when Kassandros had invaded Attica,
Olympiodoros sailed to Aetolia and persuaded the Aetolians to
come-and-help
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">boētheîn</span>\]. This allied
force was the main reason
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aition</span>\] why the
Athenians escaped war with Kassandros. Olympiodoros has not only honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] in Athens, both
on the Acropolis and in the Prytaneion \[‘City Hall’\], but also a
portrait-painting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphē</span>\] at Eleusis.
Likewise, the people of Phokis who originate from Elateia dedicated at
Delphi a bronze statue of Olympiodoros for help in their revolt from
Kassandros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.26.4">

Near the likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of Olympiodoros
stands a bronze statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Artemis
with the surname
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\]
Leukophryne, dedicated by the sons of Themistocles. I say-this-because

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\]. But my
narrative \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] must
move ahead, with its goal kept in mind, which is, to go through all
subjects relating to things Greek
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnika</span>\]
while-keeping-in-mind-the-similarities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">homoiōs</span>\]. Endoios was
an Athenian by birth and a student of Daidalos, who also, when Daidalos
was in exile because of the death of Kálōs, went with him to Crete. His
\[= of Endoios\] is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Athena
seated, with an inscription
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epigramma</span>\] saying that
Kallias dedicated the image, but Endoios made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] it.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.26.5">

There is also a building
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma</span>\] called the
Erekhtheion \[/Erechtheum\]. In front of the entrance is an altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of Zeus Hypatos
\[‘the Most High’\], on which they never sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] anything alive
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">empsūkhon</span>\] but they
deposit \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tithenai</span>\]
baked-goods \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pemmata</span>\],
and they follow-the-custom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] of not using
any wine either. As one goes inside, there are altars
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmoi</span>\], one belonging
to Poseidon, on which in following up on an oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteuma</span>\] they
sacrifice \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] also
to Erekhtheus; the second \[altar belongs\] to the hero
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōs</span>\] Boutēs; and the
third to Hephaistos. On the walls are paintings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphai</span>\] that depict
the Boutadai \[‘descendants of Boutēs’\]; there is also inside—the
building \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma</span>\] is
double—sea-water in a well
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phrear</span>\]. This is no
great wonder \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thauma</span>\],
since other inhabitants of any midland region
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mesógaia</span>\] also have
such wells, in particular the Carians who inhabit Aphrodisias. But this
particular well
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phrear</span>\] \[in Athens\]
lends itself to a scientific-write-up for this reason: it makes the
sound of waves when a south wind blows. And on the surface of the rock
is the outline \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\]
of a trident \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">triaina</span>\].
It is said that these things appeared
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phanēnai</span>\] as evidence
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">marturia</span>\] in support
of Poseidon’s claim to the land.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.26.6">

Both the city \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\]
\[of Athens\] and the whole of the land
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gē</span>\] are alike sacred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierā</span>\] to Athena; for
even those who in their demes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmoi</span>\] have traditions
of worshipping \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sebein</span>\]
other gods nevertheless hold Athena in honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\]. But the thing
that was customarily-thought
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizesthai</span>\] to be the
most holy \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hagion</span>\]
thing by all in common \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en
koinōi</span>\] already for many years before the demes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmoi</span>\] came-together
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-eltheîn</span>\] is the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Athena \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Poliás</span>\] that is
on what is now called the Acropolis, but was in early days \[called\]
the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Polis</span>. A tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] concerning it
says that it \[= the wooden statue of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Poliás</span>\] fell from the
sky \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\]; but I
will not follow up and say whether it was this way or some other way. A
golden lamp \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lukhnos</span>\]
for the goddess \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theós</span>
(feminine)\] was made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] by
Kallimakhos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.26.7">

Having filled the lamp
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lukhnos</span>\] with olive
oil, they wait until the same day next year, and the oil is sufficient
for the lamp \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lukhnos</span>\]
during the interval, although it is lit both day and night. The wick in
it is made of flax from Karpasia, the only kind of flax that does not
get burned up by the fire \[of the flame\], and a bronze palm above the
lamp reaches to the roof and draws off the smoke. The Kallimakhos who
made the lamp, although not of the first rank with regard to this craft
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnē</span>\], was
nevertheless the best in cleverness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sophiā</span>\], so that he
was the first to drill holes through stones, and he gave himself the
title of <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katatēxitekhnos</span>
\[‘having expertise in the process of melting’\], or perhaps others gave
the title and he established it as his.

In the temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Athena <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Poliás</span> \[‘of the
Polis’\] is set up a wooden Hermes, said to have been a dedication
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēma</span>\] by Kekrops,
but not clearly visible because of sprays of myrtle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mursinē</span>\]. The
votive-offerings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\] worthy of
taking-account \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\]
are, of the old ones, a folding chair, the making
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiēma</span>\] of which is by
Daidalos; also spoils taken from the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Mēdoi</span>\], namely the
breastplate \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thōrax</span>\] of
Masistios, who commanded the cavalry at Plataea,[^90] and a scimitar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">akinakēs</span>\] said to have
belonged to Mardonios. Now Masistios I know was killed by the Athenian
cavalry. But Mardonios was facing in battle the Lacedaemonians and was
killed by a Spartan; so, the Athenians could not have taken the scimitar
to begin with, and, furthermore, the Lacedaemonians would scarcely have
let them carry it off
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pheresthai</span>\].

About the olive tree
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">elaiā</span>\] they have
nothing to say except that it was evidence
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">marturion</span>\] adduced by
the goddess \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theós</span>
(feminine)\] for the contest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōn</span>\] \[with
Poseidon\] for the land. They also say that, when the the Mede \[=
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ho Mēdos</span>, = the
Persians\] set Athens on fire, the olive tree
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">elaiā</span>\] was burned
down, but on the very day it was burned it grew again to the height of
two cubits. Adjoining the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Athena is the
temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Pandrosos, the only one of the sisters who was not-guilty
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-aitios</span>\] with regard

The things about this that most of all cause-wonder
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thaumazein</span>\] for me are
not completely knowable
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gnōrima</span>\], but I will
write down what kinds of things take place. Two maidens
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthenoi</span>\] dwell
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] not far from
the temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Athena <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Poliás</span>. The
Athenians call them Arrhephoroi
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arrhēphoroi</span>\]. For a
time they live a regulated-life
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">diaita</span>\] \[there\] at
the place of the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\], but
when the festival
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] comes round
they ritually-perform
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\] at night the
following. They place on their heads what the priestess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereia</span>\] of Athena
gives them to carry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pherein</span>\]—neither she
who gives it knows
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eidénai</span>\] what it is
that she is giving nor do they who carry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pherein</span>\] it understand
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epistasthai</span>\] what it
is. Now, there is an enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\] in the
city, the enclosure of Aphrodite in the Gardens
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kēpoi</span>\], as she is
called. It is not far away, and there is an underground
descending-passage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kathodos</span>\] that goes
through it \[= the enclosure\]. This descending-passage is
not-artificial-but-natural
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">automatē</span>\]. By way of
this passage the maidens descend
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katienai</span>\], and, \[when
they arrive\] down below
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katō</span>\], they leave
behind the things they were carrying
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pherein</span>\] and
\[replacing those things\] they take
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lambanein</span>\] something
else, which they bring-back
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\]—something
that is covered
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kaluptesthai</span>\]. These
maidens \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthenoi</span>\],
after this, are dismissed, and then there are other maidens led
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] up to the
Acropolis as replacements for them.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.27.4">

Near the temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\]
of Athena is \[...\] the likeness of an old woman about a cubit high.
She is called an attendant
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">diakonos</span>\] of
Lysimakhe. And there are large bronze statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of men
facing each other for a fight, one of whom they call Erekhtheus, the
other Eumolpos. But those Athenians who are acquainted with antiquity
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ta arkhaia</span>\] must
surely know that the man killed by Erekhtheus was Immarados, the son of
Eumolpos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.27.5">

On the pedestal
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bathron</span>\] are also
statues of Theainetos, who was seer to Tolmides, and of Tolmides
himself, who when in command of the Athenian fleet inflicted severe
damage upon the enemy, especially upon the Peloponnesians who dwell
along the coast. He burned the dock-yards
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">neōria</span>\] at Gythion and
captured Boiai, belonging to the ‘peripheral-dwellers’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">perioikoi</span>\], and the
island of Cythera. He made a descent on Sikyonia, and, attacked by the
citizens as he was ravaging the country, he put them to flight and
chased them to the city. Returning afterwards to Athens, he conducted
Athenian colonists to Euboea and Naxos and invaded Boeotia with an army.
Having ravaged the greater part of the land and reduced Khairōneia by
way of a siege, he advanced into the territory of Haliartos, where he
was killed in battle and all his army defeated.[^91] Such were the
things I learned about Tolmides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.27.6">

There are also old statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Athena,
no limbs of which indeed are missing, but they are rather black and too
fragile to bear a blow. For they too were caught by the flames when the
Athenians had gone on board their ships and the King
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Basileus</span>\] \[of the
Persian Empire\] captured the city, which had been emptied of its
able-bodied inhabitants. There is also a boar-hunt (I do not know for
certain whether it is the Calydonian boar) and Kyknos fighting with
Hēraklēs. This Kyknos is said to have killed, among others, Lykos the
Thracian, a prize having been proposed for the winner of the duel, but
near the river Peneios he was himself killed by Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.27.7">

One of the Troizenian stories
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\] about Theseus
is the following. When Hēraklēs visited Pittheus at Troizen, he laid
aside his lion’s skin to eat his dinner, and there came in to see him
some Troizenian children together with Theseus, then about seven years
of age. It is said that when they saw the skin the other children ran
away, but Theseus slipped out not much afraid, seized an axe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pelekus</span>\] from the
attendants \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">diakonoi</span>\],
and straightway attacked the skin in earnest, thinking it to be a lion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.27.8">

This is the first Troizenian story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] about Theseus.
The next is that Aigeus placed boots and a sword under a rock as tokens
for the child, and then sailed away to Athens; Theseus, when sixteen
years old, pushed the rock away and departed, taking what Aigeus had
deposited. There is a representation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of what is said
in this story \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\]
on the Acropolis, everything in bronze except the rock.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.27.9">

There is another deed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] that they \[=
the Athenians\] have represented-in-the-form-of-a-dedicatory-offering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-tithenai</span>\], and
here is the tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] that pertains
to that deed. The land of the Cretans and especially the part that is
next to the river Tethris was ravaged by a bull. I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] beasts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thēria</span>\] in ancient
times were much more formidable for humans. For example, there is the
Nemean lion. And the lion of Parnassus. And so many serpents
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakontes</span>\] in many
parts of Greece \[Hellas\]. And then there are the boars of Calydon and
Erymanthos.

</div>

Also the one from Krommyon in the land of Corinth. It was said that some
\[of these beasts\] were sent up from the earth down below, that others
were sacred \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiera</span>\] to
the gods, while still others had been let loose for the punishment
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmōriā</span>\] of humankind.
In the case of this bull as well, the Cretans say that it was sent by
Poseidon to their land because, although Minos was ruler
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] of the Greek
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnikē</span>\] Sea
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Thalassa</span>\], he did not
give more honor \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\]
to Poseidon than to the other gods.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.27.10">

Anyway, they say that this bull was conveyed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] from
Crete to the Peloponnesus, and became one of what are called the Twelve
Labors \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">āthloi</span>\] of
Hēraklēs. When he was set loose on the Plain of the Argives he fled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pheugein</span>\] through the
isthmus of Corinth and then fled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pheugein</span>\] further into
the land of Attica as far as the Attic deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] of Marathon,
killing everyone he encountered, including Androgeōs, son of Minos.
Minos then sailed against Athens with his navy, not believing that the
Athenians were guiltless
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-aitioi</span>\] in the
death of Androgeōs, and oppressed them so badly that it was finally
agreed that they \[= the Athenians\] would bring seven girls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthenoi</span>\] and seven
boys \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paides</span>\] to the
Minotaur who was said to dwell
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in the
Labyrinth \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">laburinthos</span>\]
at Knossos. But, later on, Theseus is said to have driven the bull of
Marathon to the Acropolis, where he sacrificed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] it to the
goddess \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>
(feminine), = Athena\]. And the dedicatory-offering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-thēma</span>\] \[that
signals this deed\] is from the deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] of Marathon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.28.1">

Why they set up a bronze statue of Kylon in spite of his plotting a
tyranny
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannis</span>\],[^92] I
cannot say for certain; but I infer that it was because he was very
beautiful to look upon, and of no undistinguished fame
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\], having won an
Olympian victory in the double-foot-race
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">diaulos</span>\], and he had
married the daughter of Theagenes, tyrant of Megara.

Above and beyond the things that I have so far inventoried
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katalegein</span>\], there are
two tithes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dekatai</span>\]
dedicated by the Athenians in the aftermath of wars. There is first a
bronze statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]
of Athena, tithe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dekatē</span>\] from the
\[victory over the\] Persians who landed at Marathon. It is the work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnē</span>\] of Pheidias,
but the reliefs upon the shield, including the fight between Centaurs
and Lapithai, are said to have been metalworked
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">toreuein</span>\] by someone
named Mys, for whom they say Parrhasios son of Euenor designed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kata-graphein</span>\] this
and the rest of his works
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\]. The point of
the spear of this Athena and the crest of her helmet are already visible
to those sailing to Athens as they pass by Cape Sounion. The other tithe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dekatē</span>\] is a bronze
chariot, offered by the Boeotians and by the people of Khalkis in
Euboea.[^93] There are two other offerings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\], (1) a
statue of Pericles, the son of Xanthippos, and (2) the best of those
works of Pheidias that are most worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\], the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Athena
named ‘the one from Lemnos’, since those who dedicated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anatithenai</span>\] it were
from there.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.28.3">

All the Acropolis is surrounded by a wall; a part was constructed by
Kimon, son of Miltiades, but all the rest is said to have been built
round it by the Pelasgians, who once lived under the Acropolis. The
builders, they say, were Agrolas and Hyperbios. On inquiring who they
were I could discover nothing except that they were Sicilians originally
who emigrated to Akarnania.

As one descends, not to the lower city, but to just beneath the

sacred space \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\]
of Apollo in a cave
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">spēlaion</span>\]. It was
here, according to customary-thinking
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\], that Apollo
had sex \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-genesthai</span>\]
with Kreousa, daughter of Erekhtheus. \[There seems to be a gap here in
the text.\] When the Persians \[Medes\] had landed in Attica,
Philippides was sent as a messenger \[from Marathon\] to Sparta
\[Lacedaemon\]. When he returned \[to Marathon\], he said that the
Spartans \[Lacedaemonians\] had postponed sending out \[any
reinforcements\], on the grounds that it was their custom not to go out
to fight before the circle of the moon was full. Philippides went on to
say that near Mount Parthenios he had been met by Pan, who told him that
he is kindly-disposed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eu-nous</span>\] to the
Athenians and would come as their ally
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">summakhos</span>\] to
Marathon. This deity, then, gets honored

killed Halirrhothios, and what were the grounds for this act of his.

goddesses \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theai</span>\] whom
the Athenians call the Semnai \[‘the august ones’\], but Hesiod in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Theogony</span> calls them Erinyes
\[‘Furies’\].[^95] It was Aeschylus who first represented them with
snakes in their hair. But on the statues

these nor of any of the under-earth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hupo-gaioi</span>\] deities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\] is there
anything horrific. There are statues

I am prevented from thinking as trustworthy the things having to do with
the death of Oedipus as composed-in-poetry

The Athenians have other law courts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikastēria</span>\] as well,
which do not have so great a fame
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\]. There is the
so-called <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Parabuston</span> and
the Triangle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Trigōnon</span>\]; the first
of the two is in an obscure part of the city, and in it the most trivial
cases are tried; the second is named from its shape. The names of Frog
Court \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Batrakhioûn</span>\] and
Red Court
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Phoinikioûn</span>\], due to
their colors, have lasted down to the present day. The largest court, to
which the greatest numbers come, is called
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hēliaiā</span>. One of the other
courts that deal with bloodshed is called \[…\] Palladion, into which
are brought cases of involuntary homicide. All are agreed that Demophon
was the first to be put on trial there, but as to the nature of the
charge accounts differ.

It is said that after the capture of Troy \[Ilion\] Diomedes was
returning-home
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] with his
ships when night overtook them as they sailed near Phaleron. The Argives
went ashore, though they thought that they had landed in hostile
territory, since the darkness prevented them from seeing that they were
in Attica. At that point, they say that Demophon, he too being unaware
of the facts and ignorant that those who had landed were Argives,
responded-to-the-alarm-and-went-on-the-attack
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ek-boētheîn</span>\]. He
killed a number of the men, seized the Palladium, and rode off with it.
An Athenian, however, not seeing in the dark that Demophon, riding his
horse, was heading in that direction, was knocked over and trampled to
death. So, Demophon was brought to trial, some say by the relatives of
the man who was trampled, others say by the community
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò koinon</span>\] of the
Argives.

At the Delphinion are tried those who claim that they have committed
justifiable homicide, which was the plea put forward by Theseus on the
occasion when he was acquitted, after having killed Pallas, who had
risen in revolt against him, and his sons. Before Theseus was acquitted
it was the established custom among all men for the one who sheds blood
to go into exile, or, if he remained, to be put to a similar death. The
Court in the Prytaneion \[‘City Hall’\], as it is called, where they try
iron and all similar inanimate things, had its origin, I think
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizō</span>\],
in-response-to \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi</span> +
dative case\] the following event. It was when Erekhtheus was king of
Athens that the ox-slayer
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bou-phonos</span>\] first
killed an ox at the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of Zeus
Polieus. Leaving the axe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pelekus</span>\] where it lay
he went out of the land into exile, and the axe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pelekus</span>\] was
immediately put-on-trial
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krinesthai</span>\] and
acquitted, and the trial has been repeated year by year down to the
present.

Furthermore, it is also said that inanimate objects have on occasion of
their own accord inflicted righteous retribution upon men; of this the
scimitar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">akinakēs</span>\] of
Cambyses affords the best and most famous instance.[^96] Near the sea at
the Peiraieus is Phreattys. Here it is that men in exile, when a further
charge has been brought against them in their absence, make their
defense on a ship while the judges listen on land. The story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] is that Teukros
first defended himself in this way before Telamon, claiming that he had
not done anything that contributed to the death of Ajax. Let this
account suffice for those who are interested to learn about the law
courts \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikastēria</span>\].

will suffice for verification
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pistis</span>\] concerning
what-is-said \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\]:
he put down what is called the tyranny
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">turannis</span>\] of the
Thirty,[^97] setting out from Thebes with a force amounting at first to
sixty men; he also persuaded the Athenians, who were
divided-by-factionalism
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stasiazein</span>\], to be
reconciled and to abide by their reconciliation. His is the first tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\], and after it

were buried those who in Thrace, after a victorious advance as far as
Drabeskos,[^100] were unexpectedly attacked by the Edonians and

Among the generals were Leagros, to whom was entrusted chief command of
the army, and Sophanes of Decelea, who killed—when he came to the help
of the Aeginetans—Eurybates the Argive, who won the prize in the
pentathlon[^101] at the Nemean games. This was the third expedition that
the Athenians dispatched to places outside of Greece \[Hellas\]. For
against Priam and the Trojans war was made in common
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo koinou logou</span>\] by
all the Greeks

Their names are Melanopos and Makartatos, who met their death fighting

Athenians: of Cleisthenes, who invented the system of the subdivisions
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulai</span>\]
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek"></span>at present

Here too lie the men of Kleōnai, who came with the Argives into
Attica;[^104] the occasion of which I will write
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] when in the
course of my narrative
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] I come to the
Argives. There is also the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of the
Athenians who fought against the Aeginetans before the invasion of the
Medes \[Persians\]. It was surely a just decree
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleuma</span>\] even for a
democracy when the Athenians actually allowed slaves a public funeral,
and to have their names inscribed on a slab
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stēlē</span>\], which declares
that in the war they proved to be good men in relation to their masters
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">despotai</span>\]. There are
also \[written on tombs\] names of other men, their fields-of-battle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōnes</span>\] located in
various different places
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōria</span>\]. Here lie the
most renowned \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logimoi</span>\]
of those who went against Olynthus,[^105] and Melesandros, who sailed
with a fleet along the Maeander River into upper Caria;[^106]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.29.8">

also those who died in the war with Kassandros, and the Argives who once
fought as the allies of Athens. It is said that the alliance between the
two sides came about in the following way. The city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] of the
Lacedaemonians \[Spartans\] was once shaken by an earthquake sent by the
god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\], and the
Helots seceded to Ithome.[^107] After the secession the Spartans
\[Lacedaemonians\] sent for help to various places, including Athens,
and the Athenians dispatched specially-chosen troops under the command
of Kimon, the son of Miltiades. These the Spartans \[Lacedaemonians\]
dismissed, because they suspected them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.29.9">

It was intolerable, the Athenians thought, that they had been insulted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peri-hubrizesthai</span>\]
this way, and on their way back they made an alliance with the Argives,
the immemorial enemies of the Spartans \[Lacedaemonians\]. Afterwards,
when a battle was imminent at Tanagra,[^108] the Athenians opposing the
Boeotians and Spartans \[Lacedaemonians\], the Argives reinforced the
Athenians. For a time the Argives had the better, but night came on and
took from them the assurance of their victory, and on the next day the
Spartans \[Lacedaemonians\] had the better, as the Thessalians betrayed
the Athenians.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.29.10">

It occurred to me to account for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katalegein</span>\] the
following men also. First, there is Apollodoros, commander of the
mercenaries, who was an Athenian dispatched by Arsites, satrap of
Phrygia-by-the-Hellespont, and who saved their city for the Perinthians
when Philip had invaded their territory with an army.[^109] He, then, is
buried here, and also Euboulos[^110] the son of Spintharos, along with
men who though brave were not attended by good fortune; some attacked
Lakhares when he was tyrant, others planned the capture of the Peiraieus
when in the hands of a Macedonian garrison, but before the deed could be
accomplished were betrayed by their accomplices and put to death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.29.11">

Here also lie those who fell near Corinth.[^111] The god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] showed most
distinctly here and again at Leuktra[^112] that those whom the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] call brave
are as nothing if Good Fortune be not with them, seeing that the
Spartans \[Lacedaemonians\], who had on this occasion overcome
Corinthians and Athenians, and furthermore Argives and Boeotians, were
afterwards at Leuktra so utterly defeated by the Boeotians alone. After
those who were killed in Corinth, we come across elegiac verses
declaring that one and the same slab has been erected to those who died
in Euboea and Chios,[^113] and to those who perished in the remote parts
of the continent of Asia \[Minor\], or in Sicily.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.29.12">

The names of the generals are inscribed with the exception of Nikias,
and among the private soldiers are included the Plataeans along with the
Athenians. This is the reason why Nikias was passed over, and my account
is identical with that of Philistos, who says that while Demosthenes
made a truce for the others and excluded himself, attempting to commit
suicide when taken prisoner, Nikias voluntarily submitted to the
surrender.[^114] For this reason Nikias did not have his name inscribed
on the slab, being condemned as a voluntary prisoner and an unworthy
soldier.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.29.13">

On another slab are the names of those who fought in the region of
Thrace and at Megara,[^115] and when Alcibiades persuaded the Arcadians
in Mantineia and the people of Elis to revolt from the Spartans
\[Lacedaemonians\],[^116] and of those who were victorious over the
Syracusans before Demosthenes arrived in Sicily. Here were buried also
those who fought in the sea-fights near the Hellespont,[^117] those who
opposed the Macedonians at Khairōneia,[^118] those who were killed at
Delium in the territory of Tanagra,[^119] the men whom Leosthenes led
into Thessaly, those who sailed with Kimon to Cyprus,[^120] and of those
who with Olympiodoros[^121] expelled the garrison not more than thirteen
men.

The Athenians declare that when the Romans were waging a border war they
sent a small force to help them, and later on five Attic warships
assisted the Romans in a naval action against the Carthaginians.
Accordingly, these men also have their tomb here. The achievements of
Tolmides and his men, and the manner of their death, I have already set
forth, and any who are interested may take note that they are buried

Lycurgus \[Lykourgos\] provided for the state-treasury six thousand five

golden figures of Nike and ornaments for a hundred girls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénoi</span>\]; for war he
provided armor and projectiles, besides increasing the fleet to four
hundred warships. As for buildings, he completed the theater that others
had begun, while during his political life he built ship-sheds
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">neōs oikoi</span>\] at the
dockyards in Peiraieus. He built also the gymnasium near what is called
the Lyceum. Everything made of silver or gold became part of the plunder

Before the entrance to the Academy is an altar to Eros, with an
inscription indicating that Kharmos was the first Athenian to dedicate
an altar to that god. The altar within the city called the altar of
Ant-eros they say was dedicated by resident aliens, because the Athenian
Meles, spurning the love of Timagoras, a resident alien, ordered him to
ascend to the highest point of the rock and cast himself down. Now
Timagoras took no account of his life, and was ready to gratify the
youth in any of his requests, so he went and cast himself down. When
Meles saw that Timagoras was dead, he suffered such pangs of remorse
that he threw himself from the same rock and so died. From this time the
resident aliens worshipped as Ant-eros the avenging spirit of Timagoras.

In the Academy is an altar to Prometheus, and from it they run to the
city carrying burning torches. The contest is while running to keep the
torch still lit; if the torch of the first runner goes out, he has no
longer any claim to victory, but the second runner has. If his torch
also goes out, then the third man is the victor. If all the torches go
out, no one is left to be winner. There is an altar to the Muses, and
another to Hermes, and one inside to Athena, and they have built one to
Hēraklēs. There is also an olive tree, accounted to be the second that

Not far from the Academy is the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Plato, to
whom the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]
foretold
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pro-sēmainein</span>\] that he
would be the best
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aristos</span>\] when it comes
to philosophy. The manner of the foretelling
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pro-sēmainein</span>\] was
this. On the night before Plato was to become his pupil Socrates dreamed
that he saw a swan
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kuknos</span>\] fly into his
insides \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kolpos</span>\]. Now
the swan is a bird with a reputation for the art-of-the-Muses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mousikē</span>\], because,
they say, a practitioner-of-the-art-of-the-Muses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mousikos</span>\] by the name
of Swan \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kuknos</span>\] became
king of the Ligyes on the other side of the Eridanos beyond the Celtic
territory, and after his death by the will of Apollo he was changed into
the bird. I am ready to believe that a
practitioner-of-the-art-of-the-Muses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mousikos</span>\] became king
of the Ligyes, but I cannot believe that a bird was generated out of a

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of Poseidon

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Poseidon were
burned down by Antigonos[^126] when he invaded Attica, who at other

The small demes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmoi</span>\]
of Attica, the founding of all of which happenend separately, presented
the following things that are worthy of remembrance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\]. At Alimous is
a sanctuary of Demeter
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Thesmophoros</span> and of the
Maiden \[Korē\], and at Zoster \[‘Waistband’\] on the coast is an altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] to Athena, as
well as to Apollo, to Artemis and to Leto. They say that Leto did not
give birth to her children here, but loosened her waistband with a view
to her delivery, and the place received its name from this incident.
Prospalta has also a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of the Maiden
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Korē</span>\] and Demeter, and
Anagyros has a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of the Mother
of the gods. At Kephale the chief cult is that of the Dioskouroi, for
the inhabitants call them the Great gods.

At Prasiai is a temple of Apollo. Hither they say are sent the

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] to Prasiai,

died and was buried there, and at the present day there is a monument to

The people of Athmonia honor

Amarysia. On inquiry I discovered that the guides

nothing about these female figures, but I conjecture
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-ballomai</span>\] as
follows. Amarynthos is a town in Euboea, the inhabitants of which honor

the festival \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\]
of Amarysia which the Athenians celebrate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] is no less
splendid than the Euboean. The name \[of the goddess\], I think, came to
Athmonia in this way, while the Kolainis in Myrrhinous is named after
Kolainos. I have already written that many of the inhabitants of the

The Attic mountains are Pentelikos, where there are quarries, Parnes,
where there is hunting of wild boars and of bears, and Hymettos, which
grows the most suitable pasture for bees, except that of the
Alazones.[^127] For these people have actually bees ranging free, tamely
following the other creatures when they go to pasture. These bees are
not kept shut up in hives, and they work in any part of the land they
happen to visit. They produce a solid mass from which you cannot
separate either wax or honey. Such then is its nature.

Before turning to a description of the islands, I follow up further on
matters having to do with the demes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmoi</span>\] \[of Attica\].
There is a deme \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\]
called Marathon, equally distant from the city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] of the
Athenians and from Karystos in Euboea. It was at this point in Attica
that the barbarians landed, were defeated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krateîsthai</span>\] in
battle, and lost some of their ships as they were trying to pull away
\[from the shore\].[^128] On the plain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pedíon</span>\] is the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of the
Athenians, and upon it are slabs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stēlai</span>\] with
\[inscriptions of\] the names of those killed, organized by way of their
subdivisions \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phūlai</span>\];
and there is another tomb for the men of Plataea from Boeotia and also
for the slaves. I say-this-because
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gar</span>\] slaves too fought
there, and it was the first time that this happened.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.32.4">

There is also an individual monument
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] for one man,
Miltiades son of Kimon, although his end
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teleutē</span>\] happened
later, after he had failed to capture Paros and for this reason had been
put on trial by the Athenians. At this place \[= Marathon\] every night
you can hear horses neighing and you can sense that men are fighting in
combat. No one who has deliberately set out to experience this vision
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] in-full-view
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en-argēs</span>\] has ever
really had any success, but still, if something is experienced in some
alternative way by someone who has no ear for such things, this is no
cause for anger \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">orgē</span>\]
on the part of the spirits
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimones</span>\]. The people
of Marathon worship
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sebesthai</span>\] both those
who died in the fighting, calling them heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\], and also
\[the hero\] Marathon, from whom the deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] derives its
name, and then Hēraklēs, saying that they were the first among the
Greeks \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] to
establish-the-custom-of-thinking
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] him to be a

They \[= the people of Marathon\] tell about something that happened at
the battle \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">makhē</span>\] \[of
Marathon\]. It was the presence of a man who had the looks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eidos</span>\] of a farmer
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agr-oikos</span>\]—and
implements \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skeuē</span>\] to
match. Wielding a plough
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arotron</span>\] he
slaughtered with it many of the barbarians, and then, after having done
what-was-done \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\]
he disappeared \[= became
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">a-phanēs</span>\]. When the
Athenians consulted the god \[Apollo\], he did not
make-an-oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsai</span>\] with regard
to him \[= the man with the plough\] but simply commanded them to honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmân</span>\] Ekhetlaios (=
he of the plough-handle) as a hero
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōs</span>\]. A
trophy-column
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tropaion</span>\] of white
marble has been made \[to mark the turning-point or
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tropaion</span> of the battle of
Marathon\]. The Athenians say that they buried the Persians, since it is
a universally \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pantōs</span>\]
holy-thing \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hosion</span>\] for
the corpse \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nekros</span>\] of
a human to be covered by the earth, but I could not find any tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] for them.
There was neither a tumulus
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōma</span>\] nor any other
marker \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeion</span>\] to be
seen. They must have carried them \[= the dead Persians\], just as they
found them, to some ditch and tossed them in.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.32.6">

In Marathon is a spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\] called Makaria,
and what they say about it is as follows. When Hēraklēs left Tiryns,
fleeing from Eurystheus, he went to live with his friend Keyx, who was
king of Trakhis. When Hēraklēs departed the life of humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\], Eurystheus
demanded his children. But the king of Trakhis sent them to Athens,
saying that he was weak while Theseus was hardly powerless to protect
them. The arrival of the children as suppliants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiketai</span>\] caused for
the first time war between Peloponnesians and Athenians, since Theseus
refused to give them up \[= the children of Hēraklēs\] at the demand of
Eurystheus. And they say that an oracle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsmos</span>\] was given
the Athenians that one of the children of Hēraklēs must die a voluntary
death, or else victory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nīkē</span>\] could not be
theirs. Then Makaria, daughter of Deianeira and Hēraklēs, slaughtered
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-sphazein</span>\] herself
and gave to the Athenians the upper hand
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kratos</span>\] in the war and
to the spring \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\]
her own name.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.32.7">

There is at Marathon a lake
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">limnē</span>\] which for the
most part is marshy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hel-ōdēs</span>\]. Into this
lake fell the barbarians \[= the Persians\] as they were turning and
running \[after the battle\], since they did not know their way around
the roads, and it is said that much of the slaughter
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phonos</span>\] that followed
was because of this. Above the lake are the stone stables of the horses
of Artaphernes, and there are marks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeia</span>\] of his tent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skēnē</span>\] on the rocks.
Out of the lake flows a river, providing near the lake itself water
suitable for cattle, but near its mouth it becomes saline and full of
sea fish. A little beyond the plain is the Hill of Pan and a Cave of
Pan, which is worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\]. The entrance to
it is narrow, but farther in are chambers and baths and the so-called
Pan’s herd of goats, which are rocks that look very much like goats.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.1">

At some distance from Marathon is Brauron, where, they say that
Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, landed carrying the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Artemis
when she fled from Tauroi; leaving the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] there she came
to Athens also and afterwards to Argos. There is indeed an old wooden
image of Artemis here, but who in my opinion have the one taken from the
barbarians I will set forth in another place.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.2">

About sixty stadium-lengths from Marathon as you go along the road by
the sea to Oropos stands Rhamnous. The houses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēseis</span>\] for human
habitation are on the coast, but a little way inland is a sacred space
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Nemesis,
who of all the gods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\] is the most
inexorable toward humans who-commit-outrage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hubristai</span>\]. It is
thought that the wrath
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēnīma</span>\] of this
goddess \[(<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">he</span>)
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] countered the
barbarians \[= Persians\] who landed at Marathon. Scornfully thinking
that nothing stood in the way of their capturing Athens, they were
bringing a piece of Parian marble for the making
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poiēsis</span>\] of a trophy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tropaion</span>\], as if their
task were already finished.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.3">

Of this marble Pheidias made a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Nemesis,
and on the head of the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine) \] is
a garland \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stephanos</span>\]
picturing deer and small statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Nike. In
her left hand she holds an apple branch, in her right hand a cup on
which are crafted the figures of Aethiopians. As to the Aethiopians, I
could hazard no guess myself, nor could I accept the statement of those
who are convinced that the Aethiopians have been carved upon the cup
because of the river Okeanos. For the Aethiopians, they say, dwell near
it, and Okeanos is the father of Nemesis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.4">

It is not the river Okeanos, but the farthest part of the sea navigated
by man, near which dwell the Iberians and the Celts, and Okeanos
surrounds the island of Britain. But of the Aethiopians beyond Syene,
those who live farthest in the direction of the Red Sea are the
Ichthyophagoi (Fish-eaters), and the gulf round which they live is
called after them. The most righteous of them inhabit the city Meroe and
what is called the Aethiopian plain. These are they who show the Table
of the Sun,[^129] and they have neither sea nor river except the Nile.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.5">

There are other Aethiopians who are neighbors of the Mauroi and extend
as far as the Nasamones. For the Nasamones, whom Herodotus calls the
Atlantes, and those who profess to know the measurements of the earth,
named the Lixitai, are the Libyans who live the farthest close to Mount
Atlas, and they do not till the ground at all, but live on wild vines.
But neither these Aethiopians nor yet the Nasamones have any river. For
the water near Atlas, which provides a beginning to three streams, does
not make any of the streams a river, as the sand swallows it all up at
once. So the Aethiopians dwell near no river Okeanos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.6">

The water from Atlas is muddy, and near the source were crocodiles of
not less than two cubits, which when the men approached dashed down into
the spring. The thought has occurred to many that it is the reappearance
of this water out of the sand which gives the Nile to Egypt. Mount Atlas
is so high that its peaks are said to touch the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\], but is
inaccessible because of the water and the presence everywhere of trees.
Its region indeed near the Nasamones is known, but we know of nobody yet
who has sailed along the parts facing the sea. I must now resume.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.7">

Neither this nor any other ancient statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Nemesis has
wings, for not even the holiest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hagiōtata</span>\]
wooden-images \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoana</span>\]
of the people of Smyrna have them, but those who came later, wishfully
thinking that the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\]
appears-in-epiphanies
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-phainesthai</span>\]
mostly as a consequence of passionate-love
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erân</span>\], make
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] wings for
Nemesis as they do for Eros \[‘passionate-love’ personified\] . I will
now go go through what has been artistically-worked
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergazesthai</span>\] into the
pedestal of the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], having made
such preliminary remarks as I have made for the sake of clarity. The
Greeks \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] say
that Nemesis was the mother of Helen, while Leda breast-fed her and
raised \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">trephein</span>\] her.
And, along these same lines, they as well as everyone else say that the
father of Helen is not Tyndareus but Zeus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.33.8">

Having heard these things Pheidias has represented Helen as being led to
Nemesis by Leda, and he has represented Tyndareus and his children with
a man Hippeus by name standing by with a horse. There are Agamemnon and
Menelaos and Pyrrhos, the son of Achilles and first husband of Hermione,
the daughter of Helen. Orestes was passed over because of his crime
against his mother, yet Hermione stayed by his side in everything and
bore him a child. Next upon the pedestal is one called Epochus and
another youth; the only thing I heard about them was that they were
brothers of Oinoe, from whom the deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] has its name.

The land of Oropos, between Attica and the land of Tanagra, which
originally belonged to Boeotia, in our time belongs to the Athenians,
who always fought for it but never won secure possession until Philip
gave it to them after taking Thebes. Their city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] is on the coast
and affords nothing remarkable for any scientific-write-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sungraphē</span>\]. About
twelve stadium-lengths from the city

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.34.2">

opened up and received-from-down-below

here. There is a place called the Chariot

to be a god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]. In
later time, all Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] have come
around to thinking
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēgeîsthai</span>\] the same
way. I can enumerate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kata-legein</span>\] other
humans \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\] from
back then who now have honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] that belong to
gods \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\]; some even
have cities dedicated to them, such as Elaious in Chersonnesus,
dedicated to Protesilaos, and Lebadea of the Boeotians, dedicated to
Trophonios. The people of Oropos have both a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] and a white
marble statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]
of Amphiaraos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.34.3">

The altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] shows
parts. One part is to Hēraklēs, Zeus, and Apollo Healer, another is
given up to heroes and to wives of heroes, the third is to Hestia and
Hermes and Amphiaraos and the children of Amphilokhos. But Alkmaion,
because of his treatment of Eriphyle, is honored neither in the temple
of Amphiaraos nor yet with Amphilokhos. The fourth portion of the altar
is to Aphrodite and Panacea, and further to Iaso, Hygieia and Athena
Healer. The fifth is dedicated to the nymphs and to Pan, and to the
rivers Akhelōos and Kephisos. The Athenians too have an altar to
Amphilokhos in the city, and there is at Mallus in Cilicia an oracle of
his which is the most trustworthy of my day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.34.4">

The Oropians have near the temple a spring, which they call the Spring
of Amphiaraos; they neither sacrifice into it nor are accustomed to use
it for purifications or for lustral water. But when a man has been cured
of a disease through a response the custom is to throw silver and coined
gold into the spring, for by this way they say that Amphiaraos rose up
after he had become a god. Iophon of Knossos, a guide, produced
responses in hexameter verse, saying that Amphiaraos gave them to the
Argives who were sent against Thebes. These verses unrestrainedly
appealed to popular taste. Except those whom they say Apollo inspired of
old none of the seers uttered oracles, but they were good at explaining
dreams and interpreting the flights of birds and the entrails of
victims.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.34.5">

My opinion is that Amphiaraos devoted himself most to the exposition of
dreams. It is manifest that, when his divinity was established, it was a
dream oracle that he set up. One who has come to consult Amphiaraos is
accustomed first to purify himself. The mode of purification is to
sacrifice to the god, and they sacrifice not only to him but also to all
those whose names are on the altar. And when all these things have been
first done, they sacrifice a ram, and, spreading the skin under them, go
to sleep and await enlightenment in a dream.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.1">

There are islands not far from Attica. Of the one called the Island of
Patroklos I have already given an account.[^130] There is another when
you have sailed past Sounion with Attica on the left. On this they say
that Helen landed after the capture of Troy,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.2">

and for this reason the name of the island is Helene. Salamis lies over
against Eleusis, and stretches as far as the territory of Megara. It is
said that the first to give this name to the island was Cychreus, who
called it after his mother Salamis, the daughter of Asopos, and
afterwards it was colonized by the Aeginetans with Telamon. Philaios the
son of Eurysakes the son of Ajax, is said to have handed the island over
to the Athenians, having been made an Athenian by them. Many years
afterwards the Athenians drove out all the Salaminians, having
discovered that they had been guilty of treachery in the war with
Kassandros,[^131] and mainly of set purpose had surrendered to the
Macedonians. They sentenced to death Aiskhetades, who on this occasion
had been elected general for Salamis, and they swore never to forget the
treachery of the Salaminians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.3">

There are still the remains of a marketplace, a temple of Ajax and his
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] in
ebony. Even at the present day the Athenians pay honors to Ajax himself
and to Eurysakes, for there is an altar of Eurysakes also in Athens. In
Salamis is shown a stone not far from the harbor, on which they say that
Telamon sat when he gazed at the ship in which his children were sailing
away to Aulis to take part in the joint expedition of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.4">

Those who dwell about Salamis say that it was when Ajax died that the
flower first appeared in their country. It is white and tinged with red,
both flower and leaves being smaller than those of the lily; there are
letters on it like to those on the iris. About the judgment concerning
the armor I heard a story of the Aeolians who afterwards settled at
Ilion, to the effect that when Odysseus suffered shipwreck the armor was
cast ashore near the tomb of Ajax. As to the hero’s size, a Mysian was
my informant.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.5">

He said that the sea flooded the side of the tomb facing the beach and
made it easy to enter the tomb, and he told me to form an estimate of
the size of the corpse in the following way. The bones on his knees,
called by doctors the knee-pan, were in the case of Ajax as big as the
discus of a boy in the pentathlon. I saw nothing to wonder at in the
stature of those Celts who live farthest off on the borders of the land
which is uninhabited because of the cold; these people, the Kabareîs,
are no bigger than Egyptian corpses. But I will relate all that appeared
to me worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span><span custom-style="chs_highlight">\]</span>.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.6">

For the Magnesians on the Lethaios, Protophanes, one of the citizens,
won at Olympia in one day victories in the pankration[^132] and in
wrestling. Into the tomb of this man robbers entered, thinking to gain
some advantage, and after the robbers people came in to see the corpse,
which had ribs not separated but joined together from the shoulders to
the smallest ribs, those called by doctors bastard. Before the city of
the Milesians is an island called Lade, and from it certain islets are
detached. One of these they call the islet of Asterios, and say that
Asterios was buried in it, and that Asterios was the son of Anax, and
Anax the son of Earth. Now the corpse is not less than ten cubits.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.7">

But what really caused me surprise is this. There is a small city of
upper Lydia called The Doors of Temenus. There a crest broke away in a
storm, and there appeared bones the shape of which led one to suppose
that they were human, but from their size one would never have thought
it. At once the story spread among the multitude that it was the corpse
of Geryon, the son of Khrysaor, and that the seat also was his. For
there is a man’s seat carved on a rocky spur of the mountain. And a
torrent they called the river Okeanos, and they said that men ploughing
met with the horns of cattle, for the story is that Geryon reared
excellent cows.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.35.8">

And when I criticized the account and pointed out to them that Geryon is
at Gadeira, where there is, not his tomb, but a tree showing different
shapes, the guides of the Lydians related the true story, that the
corpse is that of Hyllos, a son of Earth, from whom the river is named.
They also said that Hēraklēs from his sojourning with Omphale called his
son Hyllos after the river.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.36.1">

But I will return to my subject. In Salamis is a sanctuary of Artemis,
and also a trophy erected in honor of the victory which Themistocles the
son of Neokles won for the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\].[^133] There
is also a sanctuary of Kykhreus. When the Athenians were fighting the
Persians at sea, a serpent is said to have appeared in the fleet, and
the god in an oracle told the Athenians that it was Kykhreus the hero.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.36.2">

Before Salamis there is an island called Psyttalea. Here they say that
about four hundred of the barbarians \[= Persians\] landed, and when the
fleet of Xerxes was defeated, these also were killed after the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] had crossed
over to Psyttaleia. The island has no artistic statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], only some
roughly carved-wooden-statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoana</span>\] of Pan.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.36.3">

As one goes to Eleusis from Athens along what the Athenians call the
Sacred Way \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hierā
Hodos</span>\], there is a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] that was made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]—the tomb of
Anthemokritos.[^134] The people of Megara committed against him a most
wicked deed, for when he had come as a herald to forbid them to encroach
upon the land in future they put him to death. For this act the wrath of
the Two Goddesses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theai</span>\] lies upon them
even to this day, for they are the only Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] that not
even ‘King’ \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\]
Hadrian could make more prosperous.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.36.4">

After the tombstone of Anthemokritos comes the tomb of Molottos, who was
deemed worthy of commanding the Athenians when they crossed into
Euboea[^135] to reinforce Plutarch,[^136] and also a place called
Skiron, which received its name for the following reason. The
Eleusinians were making war against Erekhtheus when there came from
Dodona a seer called Skiros, who also set up at Phaleron the ancient
sanctuary of Athena Skiras. When he fell in the fighting the Eleusinians
buried him near a torrent, and the hero has given his name to both place
and torrent.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.36.5">

Close by is the tomb of Kephisodoros, who was champion of the people and
opposed to the utmost Philip, the son of Demetrios, king of Macedon.
Kephisodoros induced to become allies of Athens two kings, Attalos the
Mysian and Ptolemy the Egyptian, and, of the self-governing peoples, the
Aetolians with the Rhodians and the Cretans among the islanders.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.36.6">

As the reinforcements from Egypt, Mysia, and Crete were for the most
part too late, and the Rhodians, whose strength lay only in their fleet,
were of little help against the Macedonian men-at-arms, Kephisodoros
sailed with other Athenians to Italy and begged aid of the Romans.[^137]
They sent a force and a general, who so reduced Philip and the
Macedonians that afterwards Perseus, the son of Philip, lost his throne
and was himself taken prisoner to Italy. This Philip was the son of
Demetrios. Demetrios was the first of this house to hold the throne of
Macedon, having put to death Alexander, son of Kassandros, as I have
related in a former part of my account.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.37.1">

After the tomb of Kephisodoros is the tomb of Heliodoros Halis. A
portrait of this man is also to be seen in the great temple of Athena.
Here too is the tomb of Themistocles, son of Poliarkhos, and grandson of
the Themistocles who fought the sea fight against Xerxes and the
Persians. Of the later descendants I shall mention none except Akestion.
She, her father Xenokles, his father Sophocles, and his father Leon, all
of them up to her great-grandfather Leon won the honor of being
torch-bearers
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dāidoukhoi</span>\], and in
her own lifetime she saw as torch-bearers, first her brother Sophocles,
after him her husband Themistocles, and after his death her son
Theophrastus. Such was the fortune
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tukhē</span>\], they say, that
happened to her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.37.2">

A little way past the tomb of Themistocles is a precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] that is
sacred \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] to
Lakios, a hero \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōs</span>\],
and there is a deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] called after
him, Lakiadai; also the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Nikokles of
Tarentum, who won a unique reputation as a citharode
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kitharōidos</span> =
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kitharā</span>-singer\]. There
is also an altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of Zephyrus and
a sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of
Demeter and her daughter. With them Athena and Poseidon have honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\]. They say that
in this place \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōrion</span>\]
Phytalos welcomed Demeter in his home, for which act the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\] gave
him the fig tree. This story is borne out by the inscription on the tomb
of Phytalos:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Hero \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōs</span>\] and king

Before crossing the Kephisos one comes to the tomb of Theodoros, the
best tragic actor of his day.[^139] By the river is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Mnesimakhe,
and a votive statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēma</span>\] of her son
cutting his hair as a gift for Kephisos. That this habit has existed
from ancient times among all the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] may be
inferred from the poetry of Homer,[^140] who makes Peleus vow that on
the safe return of Achilles from Troy he will cut off the young man’s
hair as a gift for the Sperkheios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.37.4">

Across the Kephisos is an ancient altar of Zeus Meilikhios \[‘benign’\].
At this altar Theseus obtained purification at the hands of the
descendants of Phytalus after killing brigands, including Sinis who was
related to him through Pittheus. Here is the tomb of Theodektes[^141] of
Phaselis, and also that of Mnesitheus. They say that he was a skillful
physician and dedicated statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\], among which
is a representation of Iakkhos. On the road stands a small temple called
that of Cyamites.[^142] I cannot state for certain whether he was the
first to sow beans, or whether they gave this name to a hero because
they may not attribute to Demeter the discovery of beans. Whoever has
been initiated at Eleusis or has read what are called the Orphika knows
what I mean.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.37.5">

Of the tombs, the largest and most beautiful are that of a Rhodian who
settled in Athens, and the one made by the Macedonian Harpalos, who ran
away from Alexander and crossed with a fleet from Asia to Europe. On his
arrival in Athens he was arrested by the citizens, but ran away after
bribing among others the friends of Alexander. But before this he
married Pythonikē, whose family I do not know, but she was a courtesan
in Athens and in Corinth. His love for her was so great that when she
died he made her a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] which is of all
the old tombs of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] the most

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.37.6">

There is a sanctuary in which are set statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Demeter,
her daughter, Athena, and Apollo. At the first it was built in honor of
Apollo only. That is because, as they say, Kephalos the son of Deion,
having helped Amphitryon to destroy the Teleboans, was the first to
dwell \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in the
island that now is called after him Kephallenia, and they say that he
resided \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">met-oikeîn</span>\]
till that time at Thebes, exiled from Athens because he had killed his
wife Procris. In the tenth generation afterwards Khalkinos and Daitos,
descendants of Kephalos, sailed to Delphi and asked the god for
permission to return to Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.37.7">

He ordered them first to sacrifice to Apollo in that spot in Attica
where they should see a man-of-war running on the land. When they
reached the mountain called the Many-colored Mountain a snake was seen
hurrying into its hole. In this place they sacrificed to Apollo;
afterwards they came to Athens and the Athenians made them citizens.
After this is a temple of Aphrodite, before which is a wall worthy of
viewing \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\], made of
unfinished stone.

The streams called Rheitoi are rivers only in so far as they have a flow
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">rheuma</span>\]. I say this
because the water \[of these streams\] is sea water. It is a reasonable
belief that they flow beneath the earth from the Euripos of the people
of Kalkhis, and plunge into a sea of a lower level. The streams called
Rheitoi are said to be sacred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieroi</span>\] to the Maiden
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Korē</span>\] and to Demeter,
and only the priests
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereîs</span>\] \[of these
goddesses\] are permitted to catch the fish in them. In ancient times, I
learn, these streams were the boundaries
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">horoi</span>\] between the
land of the Eleusinians and that of the other Athenians,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.38.2">

and the first to dwell
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] on the other
side of the Rheitoi was Krokon, where at the present day is what is
called the royal-palace
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basíleia</span>\] of Krokon.
This Krokon the Athenians say shared-his-welling
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-oikeîn</span>\] with
Saisara, daughter of Keleus. Not all of them say this, but only those
who belong to the deme
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] of Skambonidai.
I could not find the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Crocon, but
Eleusinians and Athenians both agreed in identifying the tomb of
Eumolpos. This Eumolpos they say came from Thrace, being the son of
Poseidon and Khione. Khione they say was the daughter of the wind Boreas
and of Oreithyia. Homer poetically-says
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] nothing about
the lineage \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">genos</span>\] of
Eumolpos, but in his verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\] he calls him
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agēnōr</span> \[‘very manly’\].

When the Eleusinians fought with the Athenians, Erekhtheus, king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] of the
Athenians, was killed, as was also Immarados, son of Eumolpos. These
were the terms on which they concluded the war: the Eleusinians were in
all ways to be subject to the Athenians—except that would be on their
own in ritually-conducting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teleîn</span>\] the
\[Eleusinian\] mysteries
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teletē</span>\]. The

performed \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\] by
Eumolpos and by the daughters of Keleus, whom Pamphos and Homer agree in
naming Diogénia, Pammerope, and, the third, Saisara. Eumolpos was
survived by Keryx, the younger of his sons whom the Kerykes themselves
say was a son of Aglauros, daughter of Kekrops, and of Hermes, not of
Eumolpos.

was the first to be sown and the first to grow crops-for-harvest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">karpos</span>\], and for this
reason it is the custom to use sacrificial-barley
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oulai</span>\] from its

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pemmata</span>\] for the
sacrifices \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiai</span>\].
Here is shown what is called the threshing-floor

As for the things inside the wall
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teikhos</span>\] of the
sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\], I
had a dream \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oneiros</span>\]
about them, but this dream did not permit me to write it down. Those who
are not initiated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">telesthentes</span>\] are of
course unable to learn of the vision \[théā\] what they are prevented
from seeing. Some say that the hero
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōs</span>\] Eleusis, after
whom the city is named, is a son of Hermes and of Daeira, daughter of
Okeanos; It has been said-poetically \[poieîn\] by others, however, that
Ogygos is the father of Eleusis. Ancient stories
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\], not backed up
by poetry \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\], have
given rise to many things that people make-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">plasasthai</span>\],
especially with regard to the genealogies

When you have turned from Eleusis to Boeotia you come to the Plataean
land, which borders on Attica. Formerly Eleutherai formed the boundary
on the side towards Attica, but when it came over to the Athenians
henceforth the boundary of Boeotia was Kithairon. The reason why the
people of Eleutherai came over was not because they were reduced by war,
but because they desired to share Athenian citizenship and hated the
Thebans. In this plain is a temple of Dionysus, from which the old
wooden image was carried off to Athens. The image at Eleutherai at the
present day is a copy of the old one.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.38.9">

A little farther on is a small cave, and beside it is a spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\] of cold water.
It is said about the cave that Antiope, after her labor, placed her
babies into it; as to the spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\], it is said that
the shepherd who found the babies washed them there for the first time,
taking off their swaddling clothes. Of Eleutherai there were still left
the ruins of the wall and of the houses. From these it is clear that the
city was built a little above the plain close to Kithairon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.39.1">

There is another road from Eleusis, which leads to Megara. As you go
along this road you come to a well called Anthium (Flowery Well).
Pamphos in his poems describes how Demeter in the likeness of an old
woman sat at this well after the abduction of her daughter, how the
daughters of Keleos thence took her as an Argive woman to their mother,
and how Metaneira thereupon entrusted to her the rearing of her son.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.39.2">

A little farther on from the well is a sanctuary of Metaneira, and after
it are tombs of those who went against Thebes. For Creon, who at that
time ruled in Thebes as guardian of Laodamas the son of Eteokles,
refused to allow the relatives to take up and bury their dead. But
Adrastos having supplicated Theseus, the Athenians fought with the
Boeotians, and Theseus being victorious in the fight carried the dead to
the Eleusinian territory and buried them here. The Thebans, however, say
that they voluntarily gave up the dead for burial and deny that they
engaged in battle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.39.3">

After the tombs of the Argives is the tomb of Alope, who, they say,
after she was made pregnant by Poseidon and became mother of Hippothoön,
was at this very place put to death by her father Kerkyon. He is said to
have treated strangers wickedly, especially in wrestling with them
against their will. So even to my day this place is called the Wrestling
Ground of Kerkyon, being a little way from the tomb of Alope. Kerkyon is
said to have killed all those who tried a bout with him except Theseus,
who outmatched him mainly by his skill. For Theseus was the first to
discover the art of wrestling, and through him afterwards was
established the teaching of the art. Before him men used in wrestling
only size and strength of body. Such in my opinion are the best-known
stories \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\] and
sights \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theõrēmata</span>\]
that the Athenians possess, and from the beginning my own narrative
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] has picked out,
from such many things, those that stand out as worth writing-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-graphein</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.39.4">

Next to Eleusis is the district called Megaris. This too belonged to
Athens in ancient times, Pylas the king having left it to Pandion. My
evidence is this; in the land is the tomb of Pandion, and Nisos, while
giving up the rule over the Athenians to Aigeus, the eldest of all the
family, was himself made king of Megara and of the territory as far as
Corinth. Even at the present day the port of the Megarians is called
Nisaia after him. Subsequently in the reign of Kodros the Peloponnesians
made an expedition against Athens. Having accomplished nothing
brilliant, on their way home they took Megara from the Athenians, and
gave it as a dwelling-place to such of the Corinthians and of their
other allies as wished to go there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.39.5">

In this way the Megarians changed their customs and dialect and became
Dorians, and they say that the city received its name when Kar the son
of Phoroneus was king in this land. It was then they say that
sanctuaries of Demeter were first made by them, and then that men used
the name Megara (Chambers). This is their history according to the
Megarians themselves. But the Boeotians declare that Megareus, son of
Poseidon, who dwelled in Onkhestos, came with an army of Boeotians to
help Nisos wage the war against Minos; that falling in the battle he was
buried on the spot, and the city was named Megara from him, having
previously been called Nisa.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.39.6">

In the twelfth generation after Kar the son of Phoroneus the Megarians
say that Lelex arrived from Egypt and became king, and that in his reign
the tribe Leleges received its name. Lelex they say fathered Kleson,
Kleson Pylas and Pylas Skiron, who married the daughter of Pandion and
afterwards disputed with Nisos, the son of Pandion, about the throne,
the dispute being settled by Aiakos, who gave the kingship to Nisos and
his descendants, and to Skīrōn the leadership in war. They say further
that Nisos was succeeded by Megareus, the son of Poseidon, who married
Iphinoe, the daughter of Nisos, but they ignore altogether the Cretan
war and the capture of the city in the reign of Nisos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.40.1">

There is in the city a fountain, which was built for the citizens by
Theagenes,[^143] whom I have mentioned previously as having given his
daughter in marriage to Kylon the Athenian. This Theagenes upon becoming
tyrant built the fountain, which is worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] for its size,
beauty and the number of its pillars. Water flows into it called the
water of the Sithnid nymphs. The Megarians say that the Sithnid nymphs
are native, and that one of them mated with Zeus; that Megaros, a son of
Zeus and of this nymph, escaped the flood in the time of Deukalion, and
made his escape to the heights of Gerania. The mountain had not yet
received this name, but was then named Gerania (Crane Heights) because
cranes were flying and Megaros swam towards the cry of the birds.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.40.2">

Not far from this fountain is an ancient sanctuary, and in our day
likenesses \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikónes</span>\]
stand in it of Roman emperors, and a bronze statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is there of
Artemis surnamed Savior. There is a story that a detachment of the army
of Mardonios, having overrun Megaris,[^144] wished to return to
Mardonios at Thebes, but that by the will of Artemis night came on them
as they marched, and missing their way they turned into the hilly
region. Trying to find out whether there was a hostile force near they
shot some missiles. The rock near groaned when struck, and they shot
again with greater eagerness,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.40.3">

until at last they used up all their arrows thinking that they were
shooting at the enemy. When the day broke, the Megarians attacked, and
being men in armor fighting against men without armor who no longer had
even a supply of missiles, they killed the greater number of their
opponents. For this reason they had an image made of Artemis Savior.
Here are also statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of the gods
named the Twelve, said to be the work of Praxiteles. But the image of
Artemis herself was made by Strongylion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.40.4">

After this, as one enters the precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] of Zeus
called the Olympieion, there is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of his there
that is worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\]. But the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus was
not finished, for the work was interrupted by the war of the
Peloponnesians against the Athenians, in which the Athenians every year
ravaged the land of the Megarians with a fleet and an army, damaging
public revenues and bringing private families to dire distress. The face
of the statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]
of Zeus is of ivory and gold, the other parts are of clay and gypsum.
The artist is said to have been Theokosmos, a native, helped by
Pheidias. Above the head of Zeus are the Seasons and Fates, and all may
see that he is the only god obeyed by Destiny, and that he apportions
the seasons as is due. Behind the temple lie half-worked pieces of wood,
which Theokosmos intended to overlay with ivory and gold in order a
complete the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.40.5">

In the temple itself is dedicated a bronze ram of a galley. This ship
they say that they captured off Salamis in a naval action with the
Athenians. The Athenians too admit that for a time they evacuated the
island before the Megarians, saying that afterwards Solon[^145] wrote
elegiac poems and encouraged them, and that thereupon the Athenians
challenged their enemies, won the war and recovered Salamis. But the
Megarians say that exiles from themselves, whom they call Dorycleans,
reached the colonists in Salamis and betrayed the island to the
Athenians.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.40.6">

After the precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] of Zeus, as
one goes up to the acropolis, which even at the present day is called
Karia from Kar, son of Phoroneus, there is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Dionysus
Nyktelios \[of the night\], also a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] for Aphrodite
Epistrophiā \[‘she-who-turns-(humans-)to-love’\], also an oracle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteîon</span>\] called ‘of
the Night’, also a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Zeus Konios
\[‘of the dust’\], which does not have a roof. The statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Asklepios
and also that of Hygieia were made by Bryaxis. Here too is what is
called the Chamber
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">megaron</span>\] of Demeter,
which was made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\], they say, by
Kar when he was king.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.1">

As one comes down from the acropolis, where the ground turns northwards,
is the tomb of Alkmene, near the Olympieion. They say that as she was
walking from Argos to Thebes she died on the way at Megara, and that the
Herakleidai got into a dispute, some wishing to convey
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\] the corpse
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nekros</span>\] of Alkmene
back to Argos, others wishing to take it to Thebes, as in Thebes were
buried Amphitryon and the children of Hēraklēs that were mothered by
Megara. But the god in Delphi gave them an oracle that it was better for
them to bury Alkmene in Megara.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.2">

From this place the local guide took us to a place which he said was
named Rhous (Stream), for that water once flowed here from the mountains
above the city. But Theagenes, who was tyrant at that time, turned the
water into another direction and made here an altar to Akhelōos. Close
by is the tomb of Hyllos, son of Hēraklēs, who fought a duel with an
Arcadian, Ekhemos the son of Aeropos. Who the Ekhemos was who killed
Hyllos I will tell in another part of my narrative, but Hyllos also is
buried at Megara. These events might correctly be called an expedition
of the Herakleidai into the Peloponnesus in the reign of Orestes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.3">

Not far from the tomb of Hyllos is a temple of Isis, and beside it one
of Apollo and of Artemis. They say that Alkathoos made it after killing
the lion from Kithairon, as he is called. By this lion they say many
were killed, including Euhippos, the son of Megareus their king, whose
elder son Timalkos had before this been killed by Theseus while on a
campaign with the Dioskouroi against Aphidna. Megareus they say promised
that he who killed the lion of Kithairon should marry his daughter and
succeed him in the kingdom. Alkathoos therefore, son of Pelops, attacked
the beast and overcame it, and when he came to the throne he built this
sanctuary, surnaming Artemis as Agrotera \[‘Huntress’\] and Apollo
Agraios \[‘Hunter’\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.4">

Such is the account of the Megarians; but although I wish my account to
agree with theirs, yet I cannot accept everything they say. I am ready
to believe that a lion was killed by Alkathoos on Kithairon, but what
historian has recorded that Timalkos the son of Megareus came with the
Dioskouroi to Aphidna? And supposing he had gone there, how could one
hold that he had been killed by Theseus, when Alcman wrote a poem on the
Dioskouroi,[^146] in which he says that they captured Athens and carried
into captivity the mother of Theseus, but Theseus himself was absent?

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.5">

Pindar in his poems agrees with this account, saying that Theseus,
wishing to be related to the Dioskouroi, carried off Helen and kept her
until he departed to carry out with Peirithoös the marriage that they
tell of. Whoever has studied genealogy finds the Megarians guilty of
great silliness, since Theseus was a descendant of Pelops. The fact is
that the Megarians know the true story but conceal it, not wishing it to
be thought that their city was captured in the reign of Nisos, but that
both Megareus, the son-in-law of Nisos, and Alkathoos, the son-in-law of
Megareus, succeeded their respective fathers-in-law as king.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.6">

It is evident that Alkathoos arrived from Elis just at the time when
Nisos had died and the people of Megara had lost everything.
Witness-to-the-truth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">marturion</span>\] of what I
say is that he built the wall
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teikhos</span>\] all over
again, from the start, since the old enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\] \[round the
city\] had been destroyed by the Cretans. Let so much suffice for memory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] about Alkathoos
and the lion, whether it was on Kithairon or elsewhere that the killing
took place that caused him to make a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] to Artemis
Agrotera and Apollo Agraios. As one goes down from this sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] there is the
hero-shrine \[hērōion\] of Pandion. My narrative
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] has already
told how Pandion was buried on what is called the Rock
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skopelos</span>\] of Athena
Aithuia \[‘Gannet’\]. He receives honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] from the people
of Megara in the city as well.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.7">

Near the hero-shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\] of Pandion is
the tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of
Hippolyte. I will write down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] the kinds of
things that the people of Megara say with regard to her. When the
Amazons, having made war against the Athenians because of Antiope, were
defeated by Theseus, most of them met their death in the fighting, but
Hippolyte, the sister of Antiope and on this occasion the leader of the
women, escaped with a few others to Megara. Having failed so badly with
her army and feeling disheartened
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">athumōs ekhein</span>\] at her
present situation, given that she felt-there-was-no-way-out
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aporeîn</span>\] with regard
to getting back home in safety
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sōtēriā</span>\] to
Themiskyra, she died in her sorrow
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lupē</span>\]. And, now that
she was dead, the people of Megara buried her. The shape
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\] of her tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] is like an
Amazonian shield
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aspis</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.8">

Not far from this is the tomb of Tereus, who married Procne the daughter
of Pandion. The Megarians say that Tereus was king of the region around
what is called Pagai \[‘springs’\] of Megaris, but my opinion, which is
confirmed by extant evidence, is that he ruled over Daulis beyond
Khairōneia, for in ancient times the greater part of what is now called
Greece \[Hellas\] was inhabited by barbarians. When Tereus did what he
did to Philomela and Itys suffered at the hands of the women, Tereus
found himself unable to seize them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.41.9">

He committed suicide in Megara, and the Megarians forthwith raised him a
barrow, and every year sacrifice to him, using in the sacrifice gravel
instead of barley meal; they say that the bird called the hoopoe
appeared here for the first time. The women came to Athens, and while
lamenting their sufferings and their revenge, perished through their
tears; their reported metamorphosis into a nightingale and a swallow is
due, I think, to the fact that the note of these birds is plaintive and
like a lamentation.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.42.1">

The Megarians have another citadel, which is named after Alkathoos. As
you ascend this citadel you see on the right the tomb of Megareus, who
at the time of the Cretan invasion came as an ally from Onkhestos. There
is also shown a hearth of the gods called Prodomeis (Builders before).
They say that Alkathoos was the first to sacrifice to them, at the time
when he was about to begin the building of the wall.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.42.2">

Near this hearth is a stone, on which they say Apollo laid his lyre when
he was helping Alkathoos in the building. I am confirmed in my view that
the Megarians used to be tributary to the Athenians by the fact that
Alkathoos appears to have sent his daughter Periboia with Theseus to
Crete in payment of the tribute. On the occasion of his building the
wall, the Megarians say, Apollo helped him and placed his lyre on the
stone; and if you happen to hit it with a pebble it sounds just as a
lyre does when struck.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.42.3">

This made me marvel, but the colossus in Egypt made me marvel far more
than anything else. In Egyptian Thebes, on crossing the Nile to the
so-called Pipes, I saw a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], still
sitting, which gave out a sound. The many call it Memnon, who they say
from Aethiopia overran Egypt and as far as Susa. The Thebans, however,
say that it is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], not of
Memnon, but of a native named Phamenoph, and I have heard some say that
it is Sesostris. This statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] was broken in
two by Cambyses, and at the present day from head to middle it is thrown
down; but the rest is seated, and every day at the rising of the sun it
makes a noise, and the sound one could best liken to that of a harp or
lyre when a string has been broken.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.42.4">

The Megarians have a council chamber which once, they say, was the tomb
of Timalkos, who just now I said was not killed by Theseus. On the top
of the citadel is built a temple of Athena, with a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] gilded except
the hands and feet; these and the face are of ivory. There is another
sanctuary built here, of Athena Nike, and yet a third of Athena Aiantis.
About the last the Megarian guides have omitted to record anything, but
I will write what I take to be the facts. Telamon the son of Aiakos
married Periboia the daughter of Alkathoos; so my opinion is that Ajax,
who succeeded to the throne of Alkathoos, made the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Athena.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.42.5">

The ancient temple of Apollo was of brick, but ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian
afterwards built it of white marble. The Apollo called Pythian and the
one called Dekatephoros \[’he who wins Tithes as a prize’\] are very
like the Egyptian wooden-statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoana</span>\] , but the one
surnamed Arkhegetes \[‘Founder’\] resembles Aeginetan works. They are
all alike made of ebony. I have heard a man of Cyprus, who was skilled
at sorting herbs for medicinal purposes, say that the ebony does not
grow leaves or bear fruit, or even appear in the sunlight at all, but
consists of underground roots which are dug up by the Aethiopians, who
have men skilled at finding ebony.

There is also a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Demeter

down from it there is the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Kallipolis,
son of Alkathoos. Alkathoos had also an elder son, Iskhepolis, whom his
father sent to help Meleagros to destroy the wild-beast
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thērion</span>\] in Aetolia.
There he died, and Kallipolis was the first to hear of his death.
Running up to the acropolis, at the moment when his father was lighting
a fire for Apollo, he flung the logs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xula</span>\] from the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\]. Alkathoos, who
had not yet heard of the fate of Iskhepolis, judged that Kallipolis was
guilty of impiety, and forthwith, angry as he was, killed him by
striking his head with one of the logs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xula</span>\] that had been
flung from the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\].

of Ino, around which is a fencing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thrinkos</span>\] of stones.
Olive trees grow there. The people of Megara are the only Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] who say that
the corpse \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nekros</span>\] of
Ino had washed ashore on their coast; more, they say that Klēsō and
Tauropolis, the daughters of Klēsōn son of Lelex, found and buried it;
even more, they say that it was in their locale \[= Megara\] that Ino
was for the first time named White Goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Leukotheā</span>\], and every
year a sacrificial-feast
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\] is celebrated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] in her honor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.43.1">

They say that there is also at that place a hero-shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\] of
Iphigeneia, since, according to them, she died in Megara. Now I have
heard another account of Iphigeneia that is given by Arcadians and I
know that Hesiod, in the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Catalogue of Women</span>,
makes-it-happen-in-his poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] that Iphigenia
does not die, but, by the will of Artemis, is Hekate. With this agrees
Herodotus, who writes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>\] that the
Tauroi near Scythia sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] those who are
shipwrecked to a maiden
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\], and they
say that this maiden
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\] is
Iphigeneia, the daughter of Agamemnon. Adrastos also has honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] \[of hero
cult\] among the people of Megara, who say that he too died among them
when he was leading back his army after capturing Thebes, and that his
death was caused by old age and by the death of Aigialeus. A sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Artemis was
made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] by
Agamemnon when he came to persuade Calchas, who dwelled
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in Megara, to
accompany him to Troy.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.43.2">

In the Prytaneion \[‘City Hall’\] are buried, they say, Euhippos the son
of Megareus and Iskhepolis the son of Alkathoos. Near the Prytaneion
\[‘City Hall’\] is a rock
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">petrā</span>\]. They name it
Anaklēthris \[‘calling-to-come-back’\], because Demeter—if this is
credible to anyone—in this place too \[= Megara, not only in other

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-kaleîn</span>\] her
daughter while wandering

In the city are tombs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphoi</span>\] of Megarians.
They made one for those who died in the invasion of the Medes
\[Persians\], and what is called the Aisymnion \[‘Shrine of Aisymnos’\]
was also a tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\]
of heroes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\].
When Agamemnon’s son Hyperion, the last who ruled-as-king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\] over the
people of Megara, was killed by Sandion for his greed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pleonexiā</span>\] and
violence \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">biā</span>\], they
resolved no longer to be ruled-by-kings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuesthai</span>\] by way
of one-man rule, but to have elected
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hairetoi</span>\] magistrates
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhontes</span>\] and to obey
one another by-taking-turns
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana meros</span>\]. Then
Aisymnos, who had a reputation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">doxa</span>\] second to none
among the Megarians, came to the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] in Delphi and
asked in what way they could be-fortunate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eudaimoneîn</span>\]. The god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]
said-in-oracular-reply
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrêsai</span>\] that they
would fare well if they took-counsel
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleuein</span>\] with the
majority. This poetic-utterance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epos</span>\] they took to
refer to the dead, and built a council-chamber
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleutērion</span>\] in this
place in order that the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of their
heroes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\] might
be inside the council-chamber
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleutērion</span>\].

Proceeding from there to the hero-shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\] of Alkathoos,
which in my day the people of Megara used as a place for the
safe-keeping \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulakē</span>\]
of written-records
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">grammata</span>\], was the
tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\], they
said, of Pyrgo, the wife of Alkathoos before he married Euaikhme, the
daughter of Megareus, and the tomb of Iphinoe, the daughter of
Alkathoos; she died, they say, a still a virgin
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\]. It is
customary for the girls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">korai</span>\] to bring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pros-pherein</span>\]
libations \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khoai</span>\] to

Beside the entrance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">esodos</span>\] to the
sanctuary-of-Dionysus
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Dionusion</span>\] is the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Astykrateia
and Manto. They were daughters of Polyidos, son of Koiranos, son of
Abas, son of Melampous, who came to Megara to purify
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kathairein</span>\] Alkathoos
in-compensation-for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi</span> + dative case\] his
killing \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phonos</span>\] of his
son Kallipolis. Polyidus also built the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Dionysus,
and dedicated a wooden-image
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] that in our
day is covered up except for the face
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prosōpon</span>\], which alone
is exposed. By the side of it is a Satyr of Parian marble made by
Praxiteles. This Dionysus they call Patrōos \[‘Ancestral’\]; but the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
another, which they surname Dasyllios, they say was dedicated by
Eukhenor, son of Koiranos, son of Polyidos.

After the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Dionysus is
a temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Aphrodite, with an ivory statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Aphrodite
surnamed Praxis \[‘Fulfilled Action’\]. This is the oldest object in the
temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\]. There is
also Peithō \[‘Persuasion’\] and another goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine) \],
whom they name Parēgoros \[‘consoler’\]—works of Praxiteles. By the
workmanship of Scopas are Erōs \[‘passionate-love’\] and Himeros
\[‘desire’\] and Pothos \[‘yearning’\], if indeed their functions
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\] are as different
as their names. Near the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Aphrodite is
a sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of
Tukhē \[‘Fortune’\], the workmanship
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekhnē</span>\] of Praxiteles.

close by are Muses and a bronze Zeus by Lysippos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.43.7">

The people of Megara have also the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Koroibos.
The poetic-verses \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\]
about him, although they are shared
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koina</span>\] by the people
of Argos, I will make clear here. They say that in the reign of Krotopos
at Argos, Psamathe, the daughter of Krotopos, bore a son to Apollo, and
being in dire terror of her father, exposed the child. He was found and
destroyed by sheepdogs of Krotopos, and Apollo sent Poinē
\[‘vengeance’\] to the city to punish the people of Argos. They say that
she used to snatch
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harpazein</span>\] children
from their mothers, until Koroibos to please the the people of Argos
killed Poinē. At which point, as a second punishment, a plague fell upon
them and did not let up. So Koroibos of his own accord went to Delphi to
submit to the punishment of the god for having slain Poinē.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.43.8">

The Pythia would not allow Koroibos to return to Argos, but ordered him
to take up a tripod and carry it out of the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\], and where the
tripod should fall from his hands, there he was to build a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Apollo and to
dwell \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] there
himself. At Mount Gerania the tripod slipped and fell unawares. Here he
dwelled \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in the
district \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmê</span>\] called
the Little-Tripods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Tripodiskoi</span>\]. The tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Koroibos is
in the marketplace
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agorā</span>\] of the people
of Megara. Elegiac
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">elegeia</span>\] verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\] about Psamathe
and of himself are written there \[on the tomb\], and further, as an
emplacement on top of the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] is represented
Koroibos slaying Poinē. These are the oldest stone statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] I am aware
of having seen among the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.44.1">

Near Koroibos is buried Orsippos who won the foot-race at Olympia by
running naked when all his competitors wore waistbands according to
ancient custom.[^147] They say also that Orsippos when general
afterwards annexed some of the neighboring territory. My own opinion is
that at Olympia he intentionally let the waistband slip off him,
realizing that a naked man can run more easily than one who is wearing a
waistband.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.44.2">

As one goes down from the marketplace
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agorā</span>\] there is on the
right of the street called Eutheia \[‘Straight’\] a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Apollo
Prostaterios \[‘Protecting’\]. One must turn a little aside from the
road to discover it. In it is an Apollo worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\], and there is an
Artemis also, and Leto, and other statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\], made by
Praxiteles. In the old gymnasium near the gate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pulai</span>\] called the
Nymphades is a stone
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lithos</span>\] of the shape
of a small pyramid. This they name Apollo Karinos, and at this place
there is a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of the
Eileithuiai. Such are the sights that the city had for the showing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epideixis</span>.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.44.3">

When one has gone down to the port
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epineion</span>\], which to
the present day is called Nisaia, there is a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Demeter
Mālophoros. One of the accounts given of the surname
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\] is that
those who first raised sheep
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">probata</span>, =
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">māla</span> in the local
dialect\] in the land named Demeter Mālophoros \[‘she who brings
sheep’\]. The roof of the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] one might
conclude has fallen in through age. There is an acropolis here, which
also is called Nisaia. Below the acropolis near the sea is the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Lelex, who
they say arrived from Egypt and became-king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileusai</span>\], being the
son of Poseidon and of Libya, daughter of Epaphos. Parallel to Nisaia
lies the small island of Minoa, where in the war against Nisos anchored
the fleet of the Cretans.

The mountainous part of the region of Megara borders upon Boeotia, and
in it the people of Megara have built the city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] Pagai and
another one called Aigosthena. As one goes to Pagai, on turning a little
aside from the highway
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">leōphoros</span>\], one is
shown a rock \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">petrā</span>\]
with arrows stuck all over it, into which the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Mēdoi</span>\] once shot in
the night. In Pagai a relic worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] is a bronze
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Artemis surnamed Sōteira \[‘Savior’\], in size equal to that at Megara
and exactly like it in pose
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\]. There is also
a hero-shrine \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\]
of Aigialeus, son of Adrastos. When the men of Argos made their second
assault on Thebes he died at Glisas early in the first battle, and his
near-and-dear carried
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\] him to Pagai
in the territory of Megara and buried him there. The hero-shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\] is still now
called the Aigialeion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.44.5">

In Aigosthena is a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Melampous,
son of Amythaon, and a small figure of a man carved upon a stele
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stēlē</span>\]. To Melampous
they sacrifice \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\]
and celebrate \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] a
festival \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] every
year. They say that he divines neither by dreams nor in any other way.
Here is something else that I heard in Ereneia, a district
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmē</span>\] of the people of
Megara. Autonoe, daughter of Kadmos, left Thebes to live here owing to
her great grief at the death of Aktaion, as the story-is-told
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legesthai</span>\], and at the
general misfortune of her father’s house. The tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Autonoe is
in this district
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmē</span>\].

As one proceeds from Megara to Corinth, there are tombs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphoi</span>\], including
that of the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>-player
Telephanes of Samos.[^148] The tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] is said to
have been made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]
by Kleopatra, daughter of Philip son of Amyntas. There is also the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Kar, son of
Phoroneus, which was originally a piled-up-mound
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōma</span>\] of earth, but
afterwards, in accordance with what the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]
said-in-an-oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsai</span>\], it was
adorned \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kosmeîn</span>\] with
a kind of stone known as
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">konkhītēs</span>
\[‘in-which-seashells
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">konkhoi</span>\]-are-embedded’\].
The people of Megara are the only Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\] to possess
this kind of <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">konkhītēs</span>
stone, and in the city also they have made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] many things
out of it. It is very white, and softer than other stone; embedded in it
through and through are seashells
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">konkhoi</span>\]. Such, then,
is the stone itself. \[As for rock formations that are also white...\]
There is a road called Skīrōnis—that is what it is called even to this
day—and it is named after Skīrōn \[= ‘he of the White Rock’\]. This
Skīrōn, when he was the military leader of the people of Megara, was the
first, they say, to make
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] it \[=
Skīrōnis\] a road usable enough for men who outfit themselves for
travel. But then ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian
broadened it, and made it more usable—so much so that even chariots
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harmata</span>\] could pass
each other going in opposite directions.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.44.7">

There are tales told with regard to those \[white\] rocks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">petrai</span>\] that become
ever more elevated as the road narrows. One of these \[elevated white
rock formations\] is a rock called Molouris, and it is from here, they
say, that Ino threw
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">rhiptein</span>\] herself into
the sea while holding Melikertes, the younger of her children. Learkhos,
the elder of them, had been killed by his father. It is said by some
that Athamas did \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\]
this in-a-state-of-madness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manēnai</span>\]; but others
say that he vented on Ino and her children his uncontrollable rage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thūmos</span>\] when he
learned about the famine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">līmos</span>\] that befell the
people of Orkhomenos and about the death—as he supposed—of Phrixos. He
\[= Athamas\] supposed that all the things happened not because of
divine power \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò
theion</span>\] but because of plotting by Ino, the stepmother.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:1.44.8">

Then it was that she \[= Ino\] fled to the sea and precipitated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aphiénai</span>\] herself and
her son from the Rock
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Petrā</span>\] that is
Molouris. The son, they say, was brought to land on the Isthmus of
Corinth by a dolphin, and honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] were given to
Melikertes, thereafter renamed Palaimon. One of these honors,
in-compensation-for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi</span> + dative case\]
him, was the celebrating
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] of the
competition \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōn</span>\]
called the Isthmia. The Rock
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Petrā</span>\] that is
Molouris has been considered to be sacred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierā</span>\] to the White
Goddess \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Leukotheā</span>\] and
Palaimon. But the other rocks, as one travels further, are
customarily-thought
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] to be
polluted \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en-ageis</span>\], in
that Skīrōn \[= ‘he of the White Rock’\], dwelling there
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">par-oikeîn</span>\], used to
cast into the sea all the strangers
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenoi</span>\] he met. A
turtle used to swim under the rocks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">petrai</span>\] to seize those
that fell in. Sea turtles are like land turtles except for their size
and for the shape of their feet, which are like those of seals.
Retribution \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span>\] for
these things overtook Skīrōn, for he was precipitated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aphiénai</span>\] into the
same sea by Theseus.

## Scroll II. Corinth

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.1">

The Corinthian land is a portion of the Argive, and is named after
Korinthos. That Korinthos was a son of Zeus I have never known anybody
say seriously except the majority of the Corinthians. Eumēlos, the son
of Amphilytos,[^149] of the family called Bakkhidai, who is said to have
composed the epic poem, says in his Corinthian History (if indeed the
history be his) that Ephyra, the daughter of Okeanos, dwelled first in
this land; that afterwards Marathon, the son of Epopeus, the son of
Aloeus, the son of Hēlios \[Sun\], fleeing from the lawless violence of
his father, migrated to the sea coast of Attica; that on the death of
Epopeus he came to Peloponnesus, divided his kingdom among his sons, and
returned to Attica; and that Asopia was renamed after Sikyon, and
Ephyraia after Korinthos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.2">

Corinth is no longer inhabited by any of the old Corinthians, but by
colonists sent out by the Romans. This change is due to the Achaean
League.[^150] The Corinthians, being members of it, joined in the war
against the Romans, which Kritolaos, when appointed general of the
Achaeans, brought about by persuading to revolt both the Achaeans and
the majority \[of the Greeks outside the Peloponnesus. When the Romans
won the war, they carried out a general disarmament of the Greeks
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes</span>\][^151] and
dismantled the walls of such cities as were fortified. Corinth was laid
waste by Mummius, who at that time commanded the Romans in the field,
and it is said that it was afterwards refounded by Caesar,[^152] who was
the author of the present constitution of Rome. Carthage, too, they say,
was refounded in his reign.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.3">

In the Corinthian territory is also the place called Cromyon from Cromus
the son of Poseidon. Here they say that Phaia was bred; overcoming this
sow was one of the traditional achievements of Theseus. Farther on the
pine still grew by the shore at the time of my visit, and there was an
altar of Melikertes. At this place, they say, the boy was brought ashore
by a dolphin; Sisyphus found him lying and gave him burial on the
Isthmus, establishing the Isthmian games in his honor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.4">

At the beginning of the Isthmus is the place where the brigand Sinis
used to take hold of pine trees and draw them down. All those whom he
overcame in fight he used to tie to the trees, and then allow them to
swing up again. Thereupon each of the pines used to drag to itself the
bound man, and as the bond gave way in neither direction but was
stretched equally in both, he was torn in two. This was the way in which
Sinis himself was slain by Theseus. For Theseus rid of evildoers the
road from Troizen to Athens, killing those whom I have enumerated and,
in sacred Epidaurus, Periphetes, thought to be the son of Hephaistos,
who used to fight with a bronze club.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.5">

The Corinthian Isthmus stretches on the one hand to the sea at
Kenkhreai, and on the other to the sea at Lekhaion. For this is what
makes the region to the south mainland. He who tried to make the
Peloponnesus an island gave up before digging through the Isthmus. Where
they began to dig is still to be seen, but into the rock they did not
advance at all. So it still is mainland as its nature is to be.
Alexander the son of Philip wished to dig through Mimas, and his attempt
to do this was his only unsuccessful project. The people of Knidos began
to dig through their isthmus, but the Pythian priestess stopped them. So
difficult it is for man to alter by violence the things that belong to
the gods \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tà theia</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.6">

What is said by the Corinthians about their land is not peculiar to
them, for I believe that the Athenians were the first to relate a
similar story to glorify Attica. The Corinthians too say that Poseidon
had a dispute with Hēlios \[Sun\] about the land, and that Briareos
arbitrated between them, assigning to Poseidon the Isthmus and the parts
adjoining, and giving to Hēlios the height above the city. Ever since,
they say, the Isthmus has belonged to Poseidon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.7">

Worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\] here are a
theater and a white-marble race-course. Within the sanctuary of the god
stand on the one side portrait statues of athletes who have won
victories at the Isthmian games, on the other side pine trees growing in
a row, the greater number of them rising up straight. On the temple,
which is not very large, stand bronze Tritons. In the front part of the
temple are statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\], two of
Poseidon, a third of Amphitrite, and a Sea, which also is of bronze. The
offerings inside were dedicated in our time by Herodes the Athenian,
four horses, gilded except for the hoofs, which are of ivory,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.8">

and two gold Tritons beside the horses, with the parts below the waist
of ivory. On the car stand Amphitrite and Poseidon, and there is the boy
Palaimon upright upon a dolphin. These too are made of ivory and gold.
On the middle of the base on which the car is has been crafted a Sea
holding up the young Aphrodite, and on either side are the nymphs called
Nereids. I know that there are altars to these in other parts of Greece,
and that some Greeks have even dedicated to them precincts by shores,
where honors are also paid to Achilles. In Gabala is a holy sanctuary of
Doto, where there was still remaining the robe by which the Greeks say
that Eriphyle was bribed to wrong her son Alkmaion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.1.9">

Among the reliefs on the base of the statue of Poseidon are the sons of
Tyndareus, because these too are saviors of ships and of sea-faring men.
The other offerings are statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Calm and
of Sea, a horse like a whale from the breast onward, Ino and
Bellerophontes, and the horse Pegasus \[Pegasos\].

Palaimon, with statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] in it of
Poseidon, Leukothea, and Palaimon himself. There is also what is called
his Holy-of-Holies
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aduton</span>
‘impenetrable’\], and an underground-descent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kathodos</span>\] to it, where

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] called the
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of the

The tombs \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphoi</span>\] of
Sisyphus and of Neleus—for they say that Neleus came to Corinth, died of
disease, and was buried near the Isthmus—I do not think that anyone
would look for after reading Eumēlos. For he says that not even to
Nestor did Sisyphus show the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Neleus,
because it must
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēnai</span>\] be kept
unknown to everybody alike, and that Sisyphus is indeed buried on the
Isthmus, but that few Corinthians, even those of his own day, knew where
the tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] was.
The Isthmian Competition
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōn</span>\] was not
interrupted even when Corinth had been destroyed by Mummius, but so long
as it \[= Corinth\] was depopulated the celebrating
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] of the Contest
was entrusted to the people of Sikyon, and when it was repopulated the
honor \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\] was
restored to the present population.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.2.3">

The names of the Corinthian harbors were given them by Lekhes and
Cenchrias, said to be the children of Poseidon and Peirene the daughter
of Akhelōos, though in the poem called The Great
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ehoiai</span> Peirene is said to
be a daughter of Oibalos. In Lechaion are a sanctuary and a bronze
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Poseidon, and on the road leading from the Isthmus to Cenchreae a temple
and ancient wooden-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\]of Artemis. In
Kenkhreai are a temple and a stone statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Aphrodite,
after it on the mole running into the sea a bronze statue of Poseidon,
and at the other end of the harbor sanctuaries of Asklepios and of Isis.
Right opposite Kenkhreai is Helen’s Bath. It is a large stream of salt,
tepid water, flowing from a rock into the sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.2.4">

As one goes up to Corinth are tombs, and by the gate is buried Diogenes
of Sinope, whom the Greeks surname the Dog. Before the city is a grove
of cypresses called Craneum. Here are a precinct of Bellerophontes, a
temple of Aphrodite Melainis and the tomb of Lais, upon which is set a
lioness holding a ram in her fore-paws.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.2.5">

There is in Thessaly another tomb which claims to be that of Lais, for
she went to that country also when she fell in love with Hippostratos.
The story is that originally she was of Hycara in Sicily. Taken captive
while yet a girl by Nikias and the Athenians, she was sold and brought
to Corinth, where she surpassed in beauty the courtesans of her time,
and so won the admiration of the Corinthians that even now they claim
Lais as their own.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.2.6">

The things worthy of mention in the city include the extant remains of
antiquity, but the greater number of them belong to the period of its
second ascendancy. On the marketplace, where most of the sanctuaries
are, stand Artemis surnamed Ephesian and wooden images of Dionysus,
which are covered with gold with the exception of their faces; these are
ornamented with red paint. They are called Lysius and Baccheus,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.2.7">

and I too give the story told about them. They say that Pentheus treated
Dionysus despitefully, his crowning outrage being that he went to
Kithairon, to spy upon the women, and climbing up a tree beheld what was
done. When the women detected Pentheus, they immediately dragged him
down, and joined in tearing him, living as he was, limb from limb.
Afterwards, as the Corinthians say, the Pythian priestess commanded them
by an oracle to discover that tree and to worship it equally with the
god. For this reason they have made these images from the tree.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.2.8">

There is also a temple of Fortune, with a standing statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Parian
marble. Beside it is a sanctuary for all the gods. Hard by is built a
fountain, on which is a bronze Poseidon; under the feet of Poseidon is a
dolphin spouting water. There is also a bronze Apollo surnamed Clarius
and a statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]
of Aphrodite made by Hermogenes of Cythera. There are two bronze,
standing statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Hermes,
for one of which a temple has been made. The images of Zeus also are in
the open; one had not a surname, another they call Khthonios (of the
Lower World) and the third Most High.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.1">

In the middle of the marketplace is a bronze Athena, on the pedestal of
which are made-in-relief-figures
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of the
Muses. Above the marketplace is a temple of Octavia the sister of
Augustus, who was emperor of the Romans after Caesar, the founder of the
modern Corinth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.2">

On leaving the marketplace along the road to Lekhaion you come to a
gateway, on which are two gilded chariots, one carrying Phaethon the son
of Hēlios \[Sun\], the other Hēlios himself. A little farther away from
the gateway, on the right as you go in, is a bronze Hēraklēs. After this
is the entrance to the water of Peirene. They say about Peirene that she
was a woman who became a spring because of her tears shed in lamentation
for her son Kenkhrias, who was unintentionally killed by Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.3">

The spring is ornamented with white marble, and there have been made
chambers like caves, out of which the water flows into an open-air well.
It Is pleasant to drink, and they say that the Corinthian bronze, when
red-hot, is tempered by this water, since bronze … the Corinthians have
not. Moreover near Peirene are a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] and a sacred
enclosure of Apollo; in the latter is a painting of the exploit of
Odysseus against the suitors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.4">

Proceeding on the direct road to Lekhaion we see a bronze statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of a seated
Hermes. By him stands a ram, for Hermes is the god who is thought most
to care for and to increase flocks, as Homer puts it in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Son was he of Phorbas, the dearest of Trojans to Hermes,

Leukothea, and Palaimon on a dolphin.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.5">

The Corinthians have baths in many parts of the city, some put up at the
public charge and one by ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian. The
most famous of them is near the Poseidon. It was made by the Spartan
Eurykles, who beautified it with various kinds of stone, especially the
one quarried at Krokeai in Laconia. On the left of the entrance stands a
Poseidon, and after him Artemis hunting. Throughout the city are many
springs \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnai</span>\], for
the Corinthians have a copious supply of flowing water, besides the
water that ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian
brought from Lake Stymphalos, but the most noteworthy is the one by the
side of the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Artemis.
Over it is a Bellerophontes, and the water flows through the hoof of the
horse Pegasus \[Pegasos\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.6">

As you go along another road from the marketplace
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agorā</span>\], which leads to
Sikyon, you can see on the right of the road a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Apollo, which
has a bronze statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of him. A
little farther along the way is a well called the Spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\] of Glauke. Into
this well they say she \[= Glauke\] threw herself, thinking that the
water would be a cure for \[the pain that she was suffering from\] the
magical drugs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pharmaka</span>\] of Medea.
Above this spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\] has been built
what is called the Odeum
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ōideion</span>\], beside which
is the tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of
Medea’s children. Their names were Mermeros and Pheres, and they are
said to have been stoned to death by the Corinthians because—as is also
said—they had brought to Glauke the gifts
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dōra</span>\] \[from Medea\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.7">

And, since their death was violent and unjust, the infant offspring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nēpia tekna</span>\] of the
Corinthians kept on being destroyed by them \[= the ghosts of the
children of Medea\] until, in accordance with what the god \[= Apollo\]
said-as-an-oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsai</span>\], yearly
sacrifices \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiai</span>\]
were established in their honor and a figure of Terror
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Deima</span>\] was
set-up-in-compensation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-stēnai</span>\]. This
figure still exists, even in my time: it is the image
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of a woman
rather frightful to look at. After Corinth was destroyed by the Romans
and the old Corinthians were wiped out, the new settlers no longer
observed the custom of offering those sacrifices
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiai</span>\] to the sons
of Medea, nor do their children \[who are initiated into the hero cult
of the children of Medea\] cut their hair for them or wear black
clothes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.8">

On the occasion referred to Medea went to Athens and lived with Aigeus,
but subsequently she was detected plotting against Theseus and fled from
Athens also; coming to the land then called Aria she caused its
inhabitants to be named after her Medes. The son, whom she brought with
her in her flight to the Arii, they say she had by Aigeus, and that his
name was Mēdos. Hellanicus, however, calls him Polyxenos and says that
his father was Jason.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.9">

The Greeks have an epic poem called Naupactia. In this Jason is
represented as having removed his home after the death of Pelias from
Iolkos to Corcyra, and Mermerus, the elder of his children, to have been
killed by a lioness while hunting on the mainland opposite. Of Pheres is
recorded nothing. But Kinaithon of Lacedaemon, another writer of
pedigrees in verse, said that Jason’s children by Medea were a son
Medeus and a daughter Eriopis; he too, however, gives no further
information about these children.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.10">

Eumēlos said that Hēlios \[Sun\] gave the Asopian land to Aloeus and
Ephyraia to Aietes. When Aietes was departing for Kolkhis he entrusted
his land to Bounos, the son of Hermes and Alkidameiā, and when Bounos
died Epopeus the son of Aloeus extended his kingdom to include the
Ephyraeans. Afterwards, when Korinthos, the son of Marathon, died
childless, the Corinthians sent for Medea from Iolkos and bestowed upon
her the kingdom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.3.11">

Through her Jason was king in Corinth, and Medea, as her children were
born, carried each to the sanctuary of Hērā and concealed them, doing so
in the belief that so they would be immortal. At last she learned that
her hopes were vain, and at the same time she was detected by Jason.
When she begged for pardon he refused it, and sailed away to Iolkos. For
these reasons Medea too departed, and handed over the kingdom to
Sisyphus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.4.1">

This is the account that I read, and not far from the tomb is the temple
of Athena Khalinitis (Bridler). For Athena, they say, was the divinity
who gave most help to Bellerophontes, and she delivered to him Pegasus
\[Pegasos\], having herself broken in and bridled him. The statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of hers is of
wood \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\], but
face, hands and feet are of white marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.4.2">

That Bellerophontes was not an absolute king, but was subject to Proitos
and the Argives is the belief of myself and of all who have read
carefully the Homeric poems.[^153] When Bellerophontes migrated to Lycia
it is clear that the Corinthians none the less were subject to the
despots at Argos or Mycenae. By themselves they provided no leader for
the campaign against Troy, but shared in the expedition as part of the
forces, Mycenaean and other, led by Agamemnon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.4.3">

Sisyphus had other sons besides Glaukos, the father of Bellerophontes a
second was Ornytion, and besides him there were Thersandros and Almus.
Ornytion had a son Phokos, reputed to have been begotten by Poseidon. He
migrated to Tithorea in what is now called Phokis, but Thoas, the
younger son of Ornytion, remained behind in Corinth. Thoas begat
Damophon, Damophon begat Propodas, and Propodas begat Doridas and
Hyanthidas. While these were kings the Dorians took the field against
Corinth, their leader being Aletes, the son of Hippotas, the son of
Phylas, the son of Antiokhos, the son of Hēraklēs. So Doridas and
Hyanthidas gave up the kingship to Aletes and remained in Corinth, but
the Corinthian people were conquered in battle and expelled by the
Dorians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.4.4">

Aletes himself and his descendants reigned for five generations to
Bacchis, the son of Prumnis, and, named after him, the Bakkhidai reigned
for five more generations to Telestes, the son of Aristodemos. Telestes
was killed in hate by Arieus and Perantas, and there were no more kings,
but Prytaneis (‘Presidents’) taken from the Bakkhidai and ruling for one
year, until Kypselos, the son of Eetion, became tyrant and expelled the
Bakkhidai.[^154] Kypselos was a descendant of Melas, the son of Antasus.
Melas from Gonoussa above Sikyon joined the Dorians in the expedition
against Corinth. When the god expressed disapproval Aletes at first
ordered Melas to withdraw to other Greeks, but afterwards, mistaking the
oracle, he received him as a settler. Such I found to be the history of
the Corinthian kings.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.4.5">

Now the sanctuary of Athena Khalinitis is by their theater, and near is
a naked wooden image of Hēraklēs, said to be a work of Daidalos. All the
works of this artist, although rather uncouth to look at, are
nevertheless distinguished by a kind of inspiration. Above the theater
is a sanctuary of Zeus surnamed in the Latin tongue Capitolinus, which
might be rendered into Greek, ‘Koruphaios’. Not far from this theater is
the ancient gymnasium, and a spring called Lerna. Pillars stand around
it, and seats have been made to refresh in summer time those who have
entered it. By this gymnasium are temples of Zeus and Asklepios. The
statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of
Asklepios and of Hygieia are of white marble, that of Zeus is of bronze.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.4.6">

The Acrocorinth is a mountain peak above the city, assigned to Hēlios by
Briareos when he acted as adjudicator, and handed over, the Corinthians
say, by Hēlios to Aphrodite. As you go up this Acrocorinth you see two
precincts of Isis, one if Isis surnamed Pelagian (Marine) and the other
of Egyptian Isis, and two of Serapis, one of them being of Serapis
called ‘Canopus’. After these are altars to Hēlios, and a sanctuary of
Necessity and Force, into which it is not customary to enter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.4.7">

Above it are a temple of the Mother of the gods and a throne; the image
and the throne are made of stone. The temple of the Fates and that of
Demeter and the Maiden have statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] that are not
exposed to view. Here, too, is the temple of Hērā Bounaia set up by
Bounos the son of Hermes. It is for this reason that the goddess is
called Bounaia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.1">

As you go up to the summit of the Acrocorinth, there is a shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Aphrodite.
The statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\]
there are Aphrodite herself, armed, also Hēlios, also Eros with a bow.
The spring \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\],
which is behind the shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\], they say was
the gift of Asopos to Sisyphus, who knew, so they also say, that Zeus
had abducted Aegina, the daughter of Asopos, but refused to give
information to the seeker before he had some spring-water given him on
the Acrocorinth. When Asopos granted this request, Sisyphus turned
informer, and because of that he receives—if anyone believes
it—punishment in Hādēs. I have heard people say that this spring-water
and Peirene are the same, and that the water in the city flows there
underground all the way from here.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.2">

This Asopos rises in the Phliasian territory, flows through the
Sikyonian, and empties itself into the sea here. His daughters, say the
Phliasians, were Corcyra, Aegina, and Thebe. Corcyra and Aegina gave new
names to the islands called Scheria and Oinone, while from Thebe is
named the city below the Kadmeia. The Thebans do not agree, but say that
Thebe was the daughter of the Boeotian, and not of the Phliasian,
Asopos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.3">

The other stories about the river are current among both the Phliasians
and the Sikyonians, for instance that its water is foreign and not
native, in that the Maeander, descending from Kelainai through Phrygia
and Caria, and emptying itself into the sea at Miletus, goes to the
Peloponnesus and forms the Asopos. I remember hearing a similar story
from the Delians, that the stream which they call Inopus comes to them
from the Nile. Further, there is a story that the Nile itself is the
Euphrates, which disappears into a marsh, rises again beyond Aethiopia
and becomes the Nile.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.4">

Such is the account I heard of the Asopos. When you have turned from the
Acrocorinth into the mountain road you see the Teneatic gate and a
sanctuary of Eileithuia. The town called Tenea is just about sixty
stadium-lengths distant. The inhabitants say that they are Trojans who
were taken prisoners in Tenedos by the Greeks, and were permitted by
Agamemnon to dwell in their present home. For this reason they honor
Apollo more than any other god.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.5">

As you go from Corinth, not into the interior but along the road to
Sikyon, there is on the left not far from the city a burned temple.
There have, of course, been many wars carried on in Corinthian
territory, and naturally houses and sanctuaries outside the wall have
been fired. But this temple, they say, was Apollo’s, and Pyrrhos the son
of Achilles burned it down. Subsequently I heard another account, that
the Corinthians built the temple for Olympian Zeus, and that suddenly
fire from some quarter fell on it and destroyed it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.6">

The Sikyonians, the neighbors of the Corinthians at this part of the
border, say about their own land that Aigialeus was its first and
aboriginal inhabitant, that the district of the Peloponnesus still
called Aigialos was named after him because he reigned over it, and that
he founded the city Aigialeia on the plain. Their citadel, they say, was
where is now their sanctuary of Athena; further, that Aigialeus begat
Europs, Europs Telchis, and Telchis Apis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.7">

This Apis reached such a height of power before Pelops came to Olympia
that all the territory south of the Isthmus was called after him Apia.
Apis begat Thelxion, Thelxion Aigyros, the Thourimakhos, and
Thourimakhos Leukippos. Leukippos had no male issue, only a daughter
Calchinia. There is a story that this Calchinia mated with Poseidon; her
child was reared by Leukippos, who at his death handed over to him the
kingdom. His name was Peratos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.5.8">

What is reported of Plemnaios, the son of Peratos, seemed to me very
wonderful. All the children borne to him by his wife died the very first
time they wailed. At last Demeter took pity on Plemnaios, came to
Aigialeia in the guise of a strange woman, and reared for Plemnaios his
son Orthopolis. Orthopolis had a daughter Khrysorthe, who is thought to
have borne a son named Koronos to Apollo. Koronos had two sons, Korax
and a younger one Lamedon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.6.1">

Korax died without issue, and at about this time came Epopeus from
Thessaly and took the kingdom. In his reign the first hostile army is
said to have invaded the land, which before this had enjoyed unbroken
peace. The reason was this. Antiope, the daughter of Nykteus, had a name
among the Greeks for beauty, and there was also a report that her father
was not Nykteus but Asopos, the river that separates the territories of
Thebes and Plataea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.6.2">

This woman Epopeus carried off but I do not know whether he asked for
her hand or adopted a bolder policy from the beginning. The Thebans came
against him in arms, and in the battle Nykteus was wounded. Epopeus also
was wounded, but won the day. Nykteus they carried back ill to Thebes,
and when he was about to die he appointed to be regent of Thebes his
brother Lykos for Labdacus, the son of Polydoros, the son of Kadmos,
being still a child, was the ward of Nykteus, who on this occasion
entrusted the office of guardian to Lykos. He also besought him to
attack Aigialeia with a larger army and bring vengeance upon Epopeus;
Antiope herself, if taken, was to be punished.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.6.3">

As to Epopeus, he forthwith offered sacrifice for his victory and began
a temple of Athena, and when this was complete he prayed the goddess to
make known whether the temple was finished to her liking, and after the
prayer they say that olive oil flowed before the temple. Afterwards
Epopeus also died of his wound, which he had neglected at first, so that
Lykos had now no need to wage war. For Lamedon, the son of Koronos, who
became king after Epopeus, gave up Antiope. As she was being taken to
Thebes by way of Eleutherai, she was delivered there on the road.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.6.4">

On this matter Asios the son of Amphiptolemos[^155] says in his poem:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Zethus and Amphion had Antiope for their mother,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Daughter of Asopos, the swift, deep-eddying river,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Having conceived of Zeus and Epopeus, shepherd of peoples.[^156]

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Homer traces their descent to the more august side of their family, and
says that they were the first founders of Thebes, in my opinion
distinguishing the lower city from the Kadmeia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.6.5">

When Lamedon became king he took to wife an Athenian woman, Pheno, the
daughter of Klytios. Afterwards also, when war had arisen between him
and Arkhandros and Arkhiteles, the sons of Achaeus, he brought in as his
ally Sikyon from Attica, and gave him Zeuxippe his daughter to wife.
This man became king, and the land was named after him Sikyonia, and the
city Sikyon instead of Aigiale. But they say that Sikyon was not the son
of Marathon, the son of Epopeus, but of Metion the son of Erekhtheus.
Asios confirms their statement, while Hesiod makes Sikyon the son of
Erekhtheus, and Ibycus says that his father was Pelops.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.6.6">

Sikyon had a daughter Khthonophyle, and they say that she and Hermes
were the parents of Polybus. Afterwards she married Phlias, the son of
Dionysus, and gave birth to Androdamas. Polybus gave his daughter
Lysianassa to Talaos the son of Bias, king of the Argives; and when
Adrastos fled from Argos he came to Polybus at Sikyon, and afterwards on
the death of Polybus he became king at Sikyon. When Adrastos returned to
Argos, Ianiskos, a descendant of Klytios the father-in-law of Lamedon,
came from Attica and was made king, and when Ianiskos died he was
succeeded by Phaistos, said to have been one of the children of
Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.6.7">

After Phaistos in obedience to an oracle migrated to Crete, the next
king is said to have been Zeuxippos, the son of Apollo and the nymph
Syllis. On the death of Zeuxippos, Agamemnon led an army against Sikyon
and king Hippolytus, the son of Rhopalus, the son of Phaistos. In terror
of the army that was attacking him, Hippolytus agreed to become subject
to Agamemnon and the Mycenaeans. This Hippolytus was the father of
Lacestades. Phalkes the son of Temenus, with the Dorians, surprised
Sikyon by night, but did Lacestades no harm, because he too was one of
the Herakleidai, and made him partner in the kingdom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.1">

From that time the Sikyonians became Dorians and their land a part of
the Argive territory. The city built by Aigialeus on the plain was
destroyed by Demetrios the son of Antigonos,[^157] who founded the
modern city near what was once the ancient citadel. The reason why the
Sikyonians grew weak it would be wrong to seek; we must be content with
Homer’s saying about Zeus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When they had lost their power there came upon them an earthquake, which
almost depopulated their city and took from them many of their famous
sights. It damaged also the cities of Caria and Lycia, and the island of
Rhodes was very violently shaken, so that it was thought that the Sibyl
had had her utterance about Rhodes[^158] fulfilled.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.2">

When you have come from the Corinthian to the Sikyonian territory you
see the tomb of Lykos the Messenian, whoever this Lykos may be; for I
can discover no Messenian Lykos who practiced the pentathlon or won a
victory at Olympia. This tomb is a mound of earth, but the Sikyonians
themselves usually bury their dead in a uniform manner. They cover the
body in the ground, and over it they build a basement of stone upon
which they set pillars. Above these they put something very like the
pediment of a temple. They add no inscription, except that they give the
dead man’s name without that of his father and bid him farewell.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.3">

After the tomb of Lykos, but on the other side of the Asopos, there is
on the right the Olympium, and a little farther on, to the left of the
road, the tomb of Eupolis, the Athenian comic poet. Farther on, if you
turn in the direction of the city, you see the tomb of Xenodice, who
died in childbirth. It has not been made after the native fashion, but
so as to harmonize best with the painting, which is very well worth
seeing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.4">

Farther on from here is the tomb of the Sikyonians who were killed at
Pellene, at Dyme of the Achaeans, in Megalopolis and at Sellasia.[^159]
Their story I will relate more fully presently. By the gate they have a
spring in a cave, the water of which does not rise out of the earth, but
flows down from the roof of the cave. For this reason it is called the
Dripping Spring.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.5">

On the modern citadel is a sanctuary of Fortune of the Height, and after
it one of the Dioskouroi. Their statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] and that of
Fortune are of wood
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoana</span>\]. On the stage
of the theater built under the citadel is a statue of a man with a
shield, who they say is Aratos, the son of Kleinias. After the theater
is a temple of Dionysus. The god is of gold and ivory, and by his side
are Bacchic women
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Bakkhai</span>\] of white
marble. These women they say are sacred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierai</span>\] to Dionysus
and are-maddened
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mainesthai</span>\] by his
inspiration. The Sikyonians have also some statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] that are
kept secret. These one night in each year they carry to the temple of
Dionysus from what they call the Kosmeterion, and they do so with
lighted torches and hymns
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">humnoi</span>\] that are local
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\]

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.6">

The first is the one named Baccheus, set up by Androdamas, the son of
Phlias, and this is followed by the one called Lysios (Deliverer),
brought from Thebes by the Theban Phanes at the command of the Pythian
priestess. Phanes came to Sikyon when Aristomakhos, the son of
Kleodaios, failed to understand the oracle[^160] given him, and
therefore failed to return to the Peloponnesus. As you walk from the
temple of Dionysus to the marketplace you see on the right a temple of
Artemis of the lake. A look shows that the roof has fallen in, but the
inhabitants cannot tell whether the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] had been saved
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] and taken
elsewhere or whether it was destroyed on the spot.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.7">

Within the marketplace is a sanctuary of Persuasion; this too has no
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]. The
worship of Persuasion was established among them for the following
reason. When Apollo and Artemis had killed Pythō they came to Aigialeia
to obtain purification. Dread coming upon them at the place now named
Fear, they turned aside to Carmanor in Crete, and the people of
Aigialeia were smitten by a plague. When the seers ordered them to
propitiate Apollo and Artemis,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.8">

they sent seven boys and seven girls as suppliants to the river Sythas.
They say that the deities, persuaded by these, came to what was then the
citadel, and the place that they reached first is the sanctuary of
Persuasion. Conformable with this story is the ceremony they perform at
the present day; the children go to the Sythas at the feast of Apollo,
and having brought, as they pretend, the deities to the sanctuary of
Persuasion, they say that they take them back again to the temple of
Apollo. The temple stands in the modern marketplace, and was originally,
it is said, made by Proitos, because in this place his daughters
recovered from their madness.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.7.9">

It is also said that in this temple Meleagros dedicated the spear with
which he slew the boar. There is also a story that the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\]
of Marsyas is dedicated here. When the Silenos met with his disaster,
the river Marsyas carried the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\]
to the Maeander; reappearing in the Asopos it was cast ashore in the
Sikyonian territory and given to Apollo by the shepherd who found them.
I found none of these offerings still in existence, for they were
destroyed by fire when the temple was burned. The temple that I saw, and
its statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\],
were dedicated by Pythokles.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.8.1">

The precinct near the sanctuary of Persuasion that is devoted to Roman
emperors was once the house of the tyrant Kleon. He became tyrant in the
modern city there was another tyranny while the Sikyonians still lived
in the lower city,[^161] that of Cleisthenes, the son of Aristonymos,
the son of Myron. Before this house is a hero-shrine of Aratos,[^162]
whose achievements eclipsed those of all contemporary Greeks. His
history is as follows.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.8.2">

After the despotism of Kleon, many of those in authority were seized
with such an ungovernable passion for tyranny that two actually became
tyrants together, Euthydemos and Timokleidas. These were expelled by the
people, who made Kleinias, the father of Aratos, their champion. A few
years afterwards Abantidas became tyrant. Before this time Kleinias had
met his death, and Aratos went into exile, either of his own accord or
because he was compelled to do so by Abantidas. Now Abantidas was killed
by some natives, and his father Paseas immediately became tyrant.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.8.3">

He was killed by Nikokles, who succeeded him.[^163] This Nikokles was
attacked by Aratos with a force of Sikyonian exiles and Argive
mercenaries. Making his attempt by night, he eluded some of the
defenders in the darkness; the others he overcame, and forced his way
within the wall. Day was now breaking, and taking the populace with him
he hastened to the tyrant’s house. This he easily captured, but Nikokles
himself succeeded in making his escape. Aratos restored equality of
political rights to the Sikyonians, striking a bargain for those in
exile; he restored to them their houses and all their other possessions
which had been sold, compensating the buyers out of his own purse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.8.4">

Moreover, as all the Greeks were afraid of the Macedonians and of
Antigonos, the guardian of Philip, the son of Demetrios, he induced the
Sikyonians, who were Dorians, to join the Achaean League. He was
immediately elected general by the Achaeans, and leading them against
the the people of Lokris in Amphissa and into the land of the Aetolians,
their enemies, he ravaged their territory. Corinth was held by
Antigonos, and there was a Macedonian garrison in the city, but he threw
them into a panic by the suddenness of his assault, winning a battle and
killing among others Persaios, the commander of the garrison, who had
studied philosophy under Zeno, the son of Mnaseas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.8.5">

When Aratos had liberated Corinth, the League was joined by the
Epidaurians and Troizenians inhabiting Argolian Acte, and by the
Megarians among those beyond the Isthmus, while Ptolemy made an alliance
with the Achaeans. The Lacedaemonians and king Agis, the son of
Eudamidas, surprised and took Pellene by a sudden onslaught, but when
Aratos and his army arrived they were defeated in an engagement,
evacuated Pellene, and returned home under a truce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.8.6">

After his success in the Peloponnesus, Aratos thought it a shame to
allow the Macedonians to hold unchallenged Peiraieus, Mounukhia,
Salamis, and Sounion; but not expecting to be able to take them by force
he bribed Diogenes, the commander of the garrisons, to give up the
positions for a hundred and fifty talents, himself helping the Athenians
by contributing a sixth part of the sum. He induced Aristomakhos also,
the tyrant of Argos, to restore to the Argives their democracy and to
join the Achaean League; he captured Mantineia from the Lacedaemonians
who held it. But no man finds all his plans turn out according to his
liking, and even Aratos was compelled to become an ally of the
Macedonians and Antigonos in the following way.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.9.1">

Kleomenes, the son of Leonidas, the son of Kleonymos, having succeeded
to the kingship at Sparta, resembled Pausanias[^164] in being
dissatisfied with the established constitution and in aiming at a
tyranny. A more fiery man than Pausanias, and no coward, he quickly
succeeded by spirit and daring in accomplishing all his ambition. He
poisoned Eurydamidas, the king of the other royal house, while yet a
boy, raised to the throne by means of the ephors his brother Epikleidas,
destroyed the power of the senate, and appointed in its stead a nominal
Council of Fathers. Ambitious for greater things and for supremacy over
the Greeks, he first attacked the Achaeans, hoping if successful to have
them as allies, and especially wishing that they should not hinder his
activities.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.9.2">

Engaging them at Dyme beyond Patrai, Aratos being still leader of the
Achaeans, he won the victory.[^165] In fear for the Achaeans and for
Sikyon itself, Aratos was forced by this defeat to bring in Antigonos as
an ally. Kleomenes had violated the peace which he had made with
Antigonos and had openly acted in many ways contrary to treaty,
especially in laying waste Megalopolis. So Antigonos crossed into the
Peloponnesus and the Achaeans met Kleomenes at Sellasia.[^166] The
Achaeans were victorious, the people of Sellasia were sold into slavery,
and Lacedaemon itself was captured. Antigonos and the Achaeans restored
to the Lacedaemonians the constitution of their fathers;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.9.3">

but of the children of Leonidas, Epikleidas was killed in the battle,
and Kleomenes fled to Egypt. Held in the highest honor by Ptolemy, he
came to be cast into prison, being convicted of inciting Egyptians to
rebel against their king. He made his escape from prison and began a
riot among the Alexandrians, but at last, on being captured, he fell by
his own hand. The Lacedaemonians, glad to be rid of Kleomenes, refused
to be ruled by kings any longer, but the rest of their ancient
constitution they have kept to the present day. Antigonos remained a
constant friend of Aratos, looking upon him as a benefactor who had
helped him to accomplish brilliant deeds.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.9.4">

But when Philip succeeded to the throne, since Aratos did not approve of
his violent treatment of his subjects, and in some cases even opposed
the accomplishment of his purposes, he killed Aratos by giving him
secretly a dose of poison. This fate came upon Aratos at Aigion, from
which place he was carried to Sikyon and buried, and there is still in
that city the hero-shrine of Aratos. Philip treated two Athenians,
Eurykleides and Mikon, in a similar way. These men also, who were
orators enjoying the confidence of the people, he killed by poison.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.9.5">

After all, Philip himself in his turn was fated to suffer disaster
through the fatal cup. Philip’s son, Demetrios, was poisoned by Perseus,
his younger son, and grief at the murder brought the father also to his
tomb. I mention the incident in passing, with my mind turned to the
inspired words of the poet Hesiod, that he who plots mischief against
his neighbor directs it first to himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.9.6">

After the hero-shrine of Aratos is an altar to Isthmian Poseidon, and
also a Zeus Meilichios (Gracious) and an Artemis named Patroa
(Paternal), both of them very inartistic works. The Meilichios is like a
pyramid, the Artemis like a pillar. Here too stand their council-chamber
and a portico called Cleisthenean from the name of him who built it. It
was built from spoils by Cleisthenes, who helped the Amphiktyones in the
war at Cirrha.[^167] In the marketplace under the open sky is a bronze
Zeus, a work of Lysippos, and by the side of it a gilded Artemis.

Hard by is a sanctuary of Apollo Lykios (wolf-god), now fallen into
ruins and not worth any attention. For wolves once so preyed upon their
flocks that there was no longer any profit therefrom, and the god,
mentioning a certain place where lay a dry log, gave an oracle that the
bark of this log mixed with meat was to be set out for the beasts to
eat. As soon as they tasted it the bark killed them, and that log lay in
my time in the sanctuary of the Wolf-god, but not even the guides of the
Sikyonians knew what kind of tree it was.

Next after this are bronze portrait statues, said to be the daughters of
Proitos, but the inscription I found referred to other women. Here there
is a bronze Hēraklēs, made by Lysippos the Sikyonian, and hard by stands
Hermes of the Marketplace.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.10.1">

In the gymnasium not far from the marketplace is dedicated a stone
Hēraklēs made by Scopas. There is also in another place a sanctuary of
Hēraklēs. The whole of the enclosure here they name Paidizē; in the
middle of the enclosure is the sanctuary, and in it is an old wooden
figure carved by Laphaēs the Phliasian. I will now describe the ritual
at the festival. The story is that on coming to the Sikyonian land
Phaistos found the people giving offerings to Hēraklēs as to a hero.
Phaistos then refused to do anything of the kind, but insisted on
sacrificing to him as to a god. Even at the present day the Sikyonians,
after slaying a lamb and burning the thighs upon the altar, eat some of
the meat as part of a victim given to a god, while the rest they offer
as to a hero. The first day of the festival in honor of Hēraklēs they
name …; the second they call Herakleia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.10.2">

From here is a way to a sanctuary of Asklepios. On passing into the
enclosure you see on the left a building with two rooms. In the outer
room lies a figure of Sleep, of which nothing remains now except the
head. The inner room is given over to the Carnean Apollo; into it none
may enter except the priests. In the portico lies a huge bone of a
sea-monster, and after it a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the
Dream-god and \[a statue of\] Sleep, surnamed Epidotes (Bountiful),
lulling to sleep a lion. Within the sanctuary on either side of the
entrance is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Pan seated,
and, on the other side, \[a statue of\] Artemis standing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.10.3">

When you have entered you see the god, a beardless figure of gold and
ivory made by Kalamis. He holds a staff in one hand, and a cone of the
cultivated pine in the other. The Sikyonians say that the god was
carried to them from Epidaurus on a carriage drawn by two mules, that he
was in the likeness of a serpent, and that he was brought by Nicagora of
Sikyon, the mother of Agasikles and the wife of Ekhetīmos. Here are
small figures
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] hanging from
the roof. She who is on the serpent they say is Aristodama, the mother
of Aratos, whom they hold to be a son of Asklepios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.10.4">

Such are the noteworthy things that this enclosure presented to me, and
opposite is another enclosure, sacred to Aphrodite. The first thing
inside is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Antiope.
They say that her sons were Sikyonians, and because of them the
Sikyonians will have it that Antiope herself is related to themselves.
After this is the sanctuary of Aphrodite, into which enter only a female
verger, who after her appointment may not have intercourse with a man,
and a virgin, called the Bath-bearer, holding her sacred office for a
year. All others are accustomed to behold the goddess from the entrance,
and to pray from that place.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.10.5">

The statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\],
which is seated, was made by the Sikyonian Kanakhos, who also fashioned
the Apollo at Didyma of the Milesians, and the Ismenian Apollo for the
Thebans. It is made of gold and ivory, having on its head a polos,[^168]
and carrying in one hand a poppy and in the other an apple. They offer
the thighs of the victims, excepting pigs; the other parts they burn for
the goddess with juniper wood, but as the thighs are burning they add to
the offering a leaf of the paideros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.10.6">

This is a plant in the open parts of the enclosure, and it grows nowhere
else either in Sikyonia or in any other land. Its leaves are smaller
than those of the esculent oak, but larger than those of the holm; the
shape is similar to that of the oak-leaf. One side is of a dark color,
the other is white. You might best compare the color to that of
white-poplar leaves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.10.7">

Ascending from here to the gymnasium you see in the right a sanctuary of
Artemis Pheraia. It is said that the wooden image was brought from
Pherai. This gymnasium was built for the Sikyonians by Kleinias, and
they still train the youths here. White marble images are here, an
Artemis crafted only to the waist, and a Hēraklēs whose lower parts are
similar to the square Hermai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.1">

Turning away from here towards the gate called Holy you see, not far
from the gate, a temple of Athena. Dedicated long ago by Epopeus, it
surpassed all its contemporaries in size and splendor. Yet the memory of
even this was doomed to perish through lapse of time—it was burned down
by lightning—but the altar there, which escaped injury, remains down to
the present day as Epopeus made it. Before the altar a barrow has been
raised for Epopeus himself, and near the tomb are the gods Averters of
evil. Near them the Greeks perform such rites as they are accustomed to
do in order to avert misfortunes. They say that the neighboring
sanctuary of Artemis and Apollo was also made by Epopeus, and that of
Hērā after it by Adrastos. I found no statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] remaining in
either. Behind the sanctuary of Hērā he built an altar to Pan, and one
to Hēlios \[Sun\] made of white marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.2">

On the way down to the plain is a sanctuary of Demeter, said to have
been founded by Plemnaios as a thank-offering to the goddess for the
rearing of his son. A little farther away from the sanctuary of Hērā
founded by Adrastos is a temple of Apollo Karneios. Only the pillars are
standing in it; you will no longer find there walls or roof, nor yet in
that of Hērā Pioneer. This temple was founded by Phalkes, son of
Temenus, who asserted that Hērā guided him on the road to Sikyon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.3">

On the direct road from Sikyon to Phleious, on the left of the road and
just about ten stadium-lengths from it, is a grove called Puraiā, and in
it a sanctuary of Hērā Protectress and the Maiden. Here the men
celebrate a festival by themselves, giving up to the women the temple
called Nymphon for the purposes of their festival. In the Nymphon are
statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of
Dionysus, Demeter, and the Maiden, with only their faces exposed. The
road to Titane is sixty stadium-lengths long, and too narrow to be used
by carriages drawn by a yoke.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.4">

At a distance along it, in my opinion, of twenty stadium-lengths, to the
left on the other side of the Asopos, is a grove of holm oaks and a
temple of the goddesses named by the Athenians the August, and by the
Sikyonians the Kindly Ones. On one day in each year they celebrate a
festival to them and offer sheep big with young as a burned offering,
and they are accustomed to use a libation of honey and water, and
flowers instead of garlands. They practice similar rites at the altar of
the Fates; it is in an open space in the grove.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.5">

On turning back to the road, and having crossed the Asopos again and
reached the summit of the hill, you come to the place where the natives
say that Titan first dwelled. They add that he was the brother of Hēlios
\[Sun\], and that after him the place got the name Titane. My own view
is that he proved clever at observing the seasons of the year and the
times when the sun increases and ripens seeds and fruits, and for this
reason was held to be the brother of Hēlios. Afterwards Alexanor, the
son of Machaon, the son of Asklepios, came to Sikyonia and built the
sanctuary of Asklepios at Titane.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.6">

The neighbors are chiefly servants of the god, and within the enclosure
are old cypress trees. One cannot learn of what wood or metal the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is, nor do
they know the name of the maker, though one or two attribute it to
Alexanor himself. Of the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] can be seen
only the face, hands, and feet, for it has about it a tunic of white
wool and a cloak. There is a similar statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Hygieia;
this, too, one cannot see easily because it is so surrounded with the
locks of women, who cut them off and offer them to the goddess, and with
strips of Babylonian raiment. With whichever of these a votary here is
willing to make propitiations, the same instructions have been given to
him, to worship this image which they are pleased to call Hygieia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.7">

There are statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] also of
Alexanor and of Euamerion; to the former they give offerings as to a
hero after the setting of the sun; to Euamerion, as being a god, they
give burned sacrifices. If I conjecture aright, the Pergamenes, in
accordance with an oracle, call this Euamerion Telesphoros
(Accomplisher) while the Epidaurians call him Akesis (Cure). There is
also a wooden image of Korōnis, but it has no fixed position anywhere in
the temple. While to the god are being sacrificed a bull, a lamb, and a
pig, they remove Korōnisto the sanctuary of Athena and honor her there.
The parts of the victims which they offer as a burned sacrifice, and
they are not content with cutting out the thighs, they burn on the
ground, except the birds, which they burn on the altar.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.11.8">

In the gable at the ends are figures of Hēraklēs and of Victories. In
the portico are dedicated statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Dionysus
and Hekate, with Aphrodite, the Mother of the gods, and Fortune. These
are wooden, but Asklepios, surnamed Gortynian, is of stone. They are
unwilling to enter among the sacred serpents through fear, but they
place their food before the entrance and take no further trouble. Within
the enclosure is a bronze statue of a Sikyonian named Granianus, who won
the following victories at Olympia: the pentathlon twice, the foot-race,
the double-course foot-race twice, once without and once with the
shield.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.12.1">

In Titane there is also a sanctuary of Athena, into which they bring up
the image of Korōnis. In it is an old wooden figure of Athena, and I was
told that it, too, was struck by lightning. The sanctuary is built upon
a hill, at the bottom of which is an Altar of the Winds, and on it the
priest sacrifices to the winds one night in every year. He also performs
other secret rites at four pits, taming the fierceness of the blasts,
and he is said to chant as well charms of Medea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.12.2">

On reaching Sikyon from Titane, as you go down to the shore you see on
the left of the road a temple of Hērā having now neither statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] nor roof. They
say that its founder was Proitos, the son of Abas. When you have gone
down to the harbor called the Sikyonians’ and turned towards
Aristonautai, the Port of Pellene, you see a little above the road on
the left hand a sanctuary of Poseidon. Farther along the highway is a
river called the Helisson, and after it the Sythas, both emptying
themselves into the sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.12.3">

Phliasia borders on Sikyonia. The city is just about forty
stadium-lengths distant from Titane, and there is a straight road to it
from Sikyon. That the Phliasians are in no way related to the Arcadians
is shown by the passage in Homer that deals with the list of the
Arcadians, in which the Sikyonians are not included among the Arcadian
confederates. As my narrative progresses it will become clear that they
were Argive originally, and became Dorian later after the return of the
Herakleidai to the Peloponnesus. I know that most of the traditions
concerning the Phliasians are contradictory, but I shall make use of
those which have been most generally accepted.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.12.4">

They say that the first man in this land was Aras, who sprang from the
soil. He founded a city around that hillock which even down to our day
is called the Arantine Hill, not far distant from a second hill on which
the Phliasians have their citadel and their sanctuary of Hebe. Here,
then, he founded a city, and after him in ancient times both the land
and the city were called Arantia. While he was king, Asopos, said to be
the son of Celusa and Poseidon, discovered for him the water of the
river which the present inhabitants call after him Asopos. The tomb of
Aras is in the place called Celeae, where they say is also buried
Dysaules of Eleusis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.12.5">

Aras had a son Aoris and a daughter Araethyrea, who, the Phliasians say,
were experienced hunters and brave warriors. Araethyrea died first, and
Aoris, in memory of his sister, changed the name of the land to
Araethyrea. This is why Homer, in making a list of Agamemnon’s subjects,
has the verse: Orneaiwas their home and Araethyrea the delightful.[^169]
The tombs of the children of Aras are, in my opinion, on the Arantine
Hill and not in any other part of the land. On the top of them are
far-seen tombstones, and before the celebration of the mysteries of
Demeter the people look at these tombs and call Aras and his children to
the libations.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.12.6">

The Argives say that Phlias, who has given the land its third name, was
the son of Ceisus, the son of Temenus. This account I can by no means
accept, but I know that he is called a son of Dionysus, and that he is
said to have been one of those who sailed on the Argo. The verses of the
Rhodian poet confirm me in my opinion:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Came after these Phlias from Araethyrea to the muster;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Here did he dwell and prosper, because Dionysus his father

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Cared for him well, and his home was near to the springs of Asopos.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

The account goes on to say that the mother of Phlias was Araethyrea and
not Khthonophyle. The latter was his wife and bore him Androdamas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.1">

On the return of the Herakleidai disturbances took place throughout the
whole of the Peloponnesus except Arcadia, so that many of the cities
received additional settlers from the Dorian lineage, and their
inhabitants suffered yet more revolutions. The history of Phleious is as
follows. The Dorian Rhegnidas, the son of Phalkes, the son of Temenus,
attacked it from Argos and Sikyonia. Some of the Phliasians were
inclined to accept the offer of Rhegnidas, which was that they should
remain on their own estates and receive Rhegnidas as their king, giving
the Dorians with him a share in the land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.2">

Hippasus and his party, on the other hand, urged the citizens to defend
themselves, and not to give up many advantages to the Dorians without
striking a blow. The people, however, accepted the opposite policy, and
so Hippasus and any others who wished fled to Samos. Great-grandson of
this Hippasus was Pythagoras, the celebrated sage. For Pythagoras was
the son of Mnesarkhos, the son of Euphranor, the son of Hippasus. This
is the account the Phliasians give about themselves, and the Sikyonians
in general agree with them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.3">

I will now add an account of the most remarkable of their famous sights.
On the Phliasian citadel is a grove of cypress trees and a sanctuary
which from ancient times has been held to be peculiarly holy. The
earliest Phliasians named the goddess to whom the sanctuary belongs
Ganymeda; but later authorities call her Hebe, whom Homer[^170] mentions
in the duel between Menelaos and Alexander, saying that she was the
cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the descent of Odysseus to
Hades,[^171] that she was the wife of Hēraklēs. Olen,[^172] in his hymn
to Hērā, says that Hērā was reared by the Seasons, and that her children
were Ares and Hebe. Of the honors that the Phliasians pay to this
goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.4">

All those who seek sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and
prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in the
grove. The Phliasians also celebrate a yearly festival which they call
Ivy-cutters. There is no statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], either kept
in secret or openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a
sacred discourse \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieros
logos</span>\] of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of
Hērā with a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Parian
marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.5">

On the citadel is another enclosure, which is sacred to Demeter, and in
it are a temple and statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Demeter and
\[one of\] her daughter. Here there is also a bronze statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Artemis,
which appeared to me to be ancient. As you go down from the citadel you
see on the right a temple of Asklepios with a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the god as
a beardless youth. Below this temple is built a theater. Not far from it
is a sanctuary of Demeter and old, seated statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.6">

On the marketplace is a votive offering, a bronze she-goat for the most
part covered with gold. The following is the reason why it has received
honors among the Phliasians. The constellation which they call the Goat
on its rising causes continual damage to the vines. In order that they
may suffer nothing unpleasant from it, the Phliasians pay honors to the
bronze goat on the marketplace and adorn the image with gold. Here also
is the tomb of Aristias, the son of Pratinas.[^173] This Aristias and
his father Pratinas composed satyric plays more popular than any save
those of Aeschylus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.7">

Behind the marketplace is a building which the Phliasians name the House
of Divination. Into it Amphiaraos entered, slept the night there, and
then first, say the Phliasians, began to divine. According to their
account Amphiaraos was for a time an ordinary person and no diviner.
Ever since that time the building has been shut up. Not far away is what
is called the Omphalos (Navel), the center of all the Peloponnesus, if
they speak the truth about it. Farther on from the Omphalos they have an
old sanctuary of Dionysus, a sanctuary of Apollo, and one of Isis. The
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Dionysus is visible to all, and so also is that of Apollo, but the image
of Isis only the priests may behold.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.13.8">

There is also a tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] told by
Phliasians, and it goes like this. When Hēraklēs came back safe from
Libya, bringing the apples of the Hesperides, as they were called, he
visited Phleious on some private matter. While he was staying there
Oineus came to him from Aetolia. He had already allied himself to the
lineage of Hēraklēs, and after his arrival on this occasion either he
entertained Hēraklēs or Hēraklēs entertained him. Be this as it may,
displeased with the drink given him Hēraklēs struck on the head with one
of his fingers the boy Cyathus, the cup-bearer of Oineus, who died on
the spot from the blow. A chapel keeps the memory of the deed fresh
among the Phliasians; it is built by the side of the sanctuary of
Apollo, and it contains statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] made of
stone representing Cyathus holding out a cup to Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.14.1">

Celeae is some five stadium-lengths distant from the city, and here they
celebrate the mysteries in honor of Demeter, not every year but every
fourth year. The initiating priest is not appointed for life, but at
each celebration they elect a fresh one, who takes, if he cares to do
so, a wife. In this respect their custom differs from that at Eleusis,
but the actual celebration is modeled on the Eleusinian rites. The
Phliasians themselves admit that they copy the ‘performance’ at Eleusis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.14.2">

They say that it was Dysaules, the brother of Keleus, who came to their
land and established the mysteries, and that he had been expelled from
Eleusis by Ion, when Ion, the son of Xuthus, was chosen by the Athenians
to be commander-in-chief in the Eleusinian war. Now I cannot possibly
agree with the Phliasians in supposing that an Eleusinian was conquered
in battle and driven away into exile, for the war terminated in a treaty
before it was fought out, and Eumolpos himself remained at Eleusis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.14.3">

But it is possible that Dysaules came to Phleious for some other reason
than that given by the Phliasians. I do not believe either that he was
related to Keleus, or that he was in any way distinguished at Eleusis,
otherwise Homer would never have passed him by in his poems. For Homer
is one of those who have written in honor of Demeter, and when he is
making a list of those to whom the goddess taught the mysteries he knows
nothing of an Eleusinian named Dysaules. These are the verses:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

She to Triptolemos taught, and to Diokles, driver of horses,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Also to mighty Eumolpos, to Keleus, leader of peoples,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Cult of the holy rites, to them all her mystery telling.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.14.4">

At all events, this Dysaules, according to the Phliasians, established
the mysteries here, and he it was who gave to the place the name Celeae.
I have already said that the tomb of Dysaules is here. So the tomb of
Aras was made earlier, for according to the account of the Phliasians
Dysaules did not arrive in the reign of Aras, but later. For Aras, they
say, was a contemporary of Prometheus, the son of Iapetos, and three
generations of men older than Pelasgus the son of Arkas and those called
in Athens aboriginals. On the roof of what is called the Anactorum they
say is dedicated the chariot of Pelops.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.15.1">

These are the things that I found most worthy of mention among the
Phliasians. On the road from Corinth to Argos is a small city Kleonai.
They say that Kleones was a son of Pelops, though there are some who say
that Kleone was one of the daughters of Asopos, that flows by the side
of Sikyon. Be this as it may, one or other of these two accounts for the
name of the city. Here there is a sanctuary of Athena, and the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is a work of
Skyllis and Dipoinos.[^174] Some hold them to have been the pupils of
Daidalos, but others will have it that Daidalos took a wife from Gortyn,
and that Dipoinos and Skyllis were his sons by this woman. Kleonai
possesses this sanctuary and the tomb of Eurytos and Kteatos. The story
is that as they were going as ambassadors from Elis to the Isthmian
contest they were here shot by Hēraklēs, who charged them with being his
adversaries in the war against Augeias.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.15.2">

From Kleonai to Argos are two roads; one is direct and only for men who
are physically fit, the other goes along the pass called Trētos, is
narrow like the other, being surrounded by mountains, but is
nevertheless more suitable for vehicles. In these mountains is still
shown the cave of the famous lion, and the place
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōrion</span>\] called Neméā
is distant some fifteen stadium-lengths. In Neméā is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Nemean
\[<span custom-style="chs_foreign_emphasis">Nemeios</span>\] Zeus, which
is worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\], but I found
that the roof had caved in and that there was no longer any statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] \[of Zeus\]
left. Around the temple is a grove of cypress trees, and here it is,
they say, that Opheltes was placed by his nurse in the grass and killed
by the serpent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakōn</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.15.3">

The Argives offer-sacrifices
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] to Zeus the
Nemean \[Nemeios\] in Nemeā, and elect a priest of Nemean Zeus; moreover
they offer a prize for a race in armor at the winter celebration of the
Nemean games. In this place is the tomb of Opheltes; around it is a
fence of stones, and within the enclosure are altars. There is also a
mound of earth which is the tomb of Lycurgus \[Lykourgos\] the father of
Opheltes. The spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\] they call
Adrasteia for some reason
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\] or other,
perhaps because Adrastos found it. The land was named, they say, after
Nemeā, who was another daughter of Asopos. Above Nemeā is Mount Apesas,
where they say that Perseus first made-sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] to Zeus of
Apesas.

Going upland to \[the pass called\] Trētos and then down again along the
road to Argos, you see on the left the ruins
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ereipia</span>\] of Mycenae.
The Greeks are generally aware that the founder
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikistēs</span>\] of Mycenae
was Perseus, but I will also write down the cause
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\] of its
foundation \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikismos</span>\]
and the pretext
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prophasis</span>\] that
theArgives gave when they at a later point destroyed Mycenae. In the
region now called Argolis, some things most ancient are not memorialized
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmoneuein</span>\] while
other things are, and here is one such thing: they say that Inakhos was
once their king and that he named the river Inakhos after himself and
that he sacrificed to Hērā.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.15.5">

There is also another tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] told
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legesthai</span>\] that goes
like this… that Phoroneus was the first to be born in this land, and
that Inakhos, the father of Phoroneus, was not a man but the river. This
river, with the rivers Kephisos and Asterion, arbitrated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikazein</span>\] concerning
possession of the land between Poseidon and Hērā. They decided
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krinein</span>\] that the land
belonged to Hērā, and so Poseidon made their waters disappear. For this
reason neither Inakhos nor either of the other rivers I have mentioned
provides any water except whenver the god \[= Zeus\] makes rain. In
summer their streams are dry except for those at Lerna. Phoroneus, the
son of Inakhos, was the first to gather together humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\] into a
commonality \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koinon</span>\],
who up to that time had been scattered and
living-in-settlements\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\]
all by themselves. The place into which they were first gathered was
named the City \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Astu</span>\]
of Phoroneus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.16.1">

Argos, the maternal grandson of Phoroneus became king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] after
Phoroneus andgave his own name to the land. Argos fathered Peirasos and
Phorbas, Phorbas fathered Triopas, and Triopas fathered Iasos and
Agenor. Io, the daughter of Iasos, went to Egypt, whether the
circumstances be as Herodotus writes or as the Greeks say. After Iasos,
Krotopos the son of Agenor came to power
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] and fathered
Sthenelas, but Danaos sailed from Egypt against Gelanor the son of
Sthenelasand put a stop to the succession of the descendants of Agenor
to kingship. What followed is known to all alike the crime that the
daughters of Danaos committed against their male cousins, and how, after
the death of Danaos, Lynkeus succeeded him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.16.2">

Then there was Abas the son of Lynkeus, and his own sons Akrisios and
Proitos divided the kingship
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileiā</span>\] between
themselves. Akrisios remained where he was at Argos, and Proitos took
over the Hēraion, Mideiā, Tiryns, and the Argive coastal region. Traces
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeia</span>\] of the
residence \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēsis</span>\] of
Proitos in Tiryns remain to the present day. Afterwards Akrisios,
learning that Perseus himself was not only alive but accomplishing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apodeiknusthai</span>\] great
deeds, withdrew to Larisa, by \[the river\] Pēneios. And Perseus,
wishing at all costs to see the father of his mother and to greet him
with fair words and deeds, visited him at Larisa. Being in the prime of
life and proud of being the inventor of the discus, he showed off
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apodeiknusthai</span>\] \[his
skill in throwing the discus\] in front of everybody, and Akrisios,
through the agency of some superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\], stepped
unnoticed into the path of the discus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.16.3">

So the prediction of the god to Akrisios found its fulfillment
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">telos</span>\], nor was
the-thing-that-had-been-prophesied
\[t<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ò khreōn</span>\] prevented
by his precautions against his daughter and the son of his daughter.
Perseus felt shame because of what-was-said
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] about the
homicide, and so, on his return to Argos, he induced Megapenthes, the
son of Proitos, to make an exchange of kingdoms; taking over for himself
the rule \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] of the
kindom of Megapenthes, he founded
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ktizein</span>\] Mycenae. For
on its site the pommel \[myces =
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mukēs</span>\] fell out of his
sword, and he regarded this as a sign
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeion</span>\] to establish
the foundation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikismos</span>\] of a citadel
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\]. I have also
heard the following account. He was thirsty, and the thought occurred to
him to pick up a mushroom \[myces =
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mukēs</span>\] from the ground.
Water flowed from that spot, and, taking delight in drinking from it, he
gave to the place the name of Mycenae.

Homer in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> \[2.120\]
mentions a woman \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gunē</span>\]

in the following verse:

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

say that the name of the citadel
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] originated from
her \[= Mycene = Mukēnē\]. But the tradition that is attributed to
Acusilaus (Akousilaos), that Myceneus \[Mukēneus\] was the son of
Sparton \[Spartōn\], and Sparton of Phoroneus, I cannot accept
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-dekhesthai</span>\],
because the Lacedaemonians themselves do not accept it either. I say
this because, although the Lacedaemonians have at Amyklai an image
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of a woman
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gunē</span>\] named Spartē,

Phoroneus.

It was envy that caused the Argives to destroy Mycenae. For at the time
of the Persian invasion the Argives made-no-move
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēsukhazein</span>\], but the
Mycenaeans sent eighty men to Thermopylae who shared in the achievement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] of the
Lacedaemonians. This act-of-eagerness-for-distinction
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">philo-tīmēma</span>\] brought
ruin upon them by aggravating the Argives. There still remain, however,
parts of the enclosing-wall
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\], including
the gate \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pulē</span>\], on top
of which stand lions. These \[walls\], too, are said to be the work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\] of the Cyclopes,

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teikhos</span>\] at Tiryns.

Inside the ruins
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ereipia</span>\] of Mycenae is
a spring \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\] called

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hupo-gaia

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paides</span>\], in which were

there, along with the tombs of those who, besides Agamemnon, returned
with him from Troy and were slaughtered by Aigisthos after they had been
wined and dined by him at a banquet. As for the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\][^175] of
Cassandra \[Kassandrā\], there is a rival claim to it by the
Lacedaemonians who dwell
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in the
vicinity of Amyklai. There is \[at Mycenae\] another tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] \[besides the

Agamemnon, and there is also another tomb belonging to Eurymedon his

whom while they were still infants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nēpioi</span>\] Aigisthos
slaughtered after he slaughtered their parents. As for Electra … Orestes
married her off to Pylades, and Hellanicus adds that the children of
Pylades by Electra were Medon and Strophios. Clytemnestra and Aigisthos
were buried at some little distance from the \[circumference-\]wall

Fifteen stadium-lengths distant from Mycenae is on the left the Hēraion.
Alongside the road flows the rivulet called ‘the-water-that-makes-free’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Eleutherion</span>\]. The
women who attend the sacred space
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] use it \[= the

sacrifices \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusai</span>\]
that are mystical
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-rrhētoi</span>\]. The
sacred space \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\]
itself is on a lower part of Euboea. Euboea is the name they give to the
hill here, saying that Asterion the river had three daughters, Euboea,
Prosymna, and Akraia, and that they were nurses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">trophoi</span>\] of Hērā.

The hill opposite the Hēraion they name after Akraia, while the environs
of the sacred space

after Euboea, and, further, the land beneath the Hēraion they name after
Prosymna. This on flows above the Hēraion, and falling into a cleft
disappears. On its banks grows a plant, which also is called
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">asterion</span>. They offer the

It is said that the architect of the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] was Eupolemos,
an Argive. The sculptures carved above the columns
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kiones</span>\] refer not only
to the birth \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">genesis</span>\]
of Zeus and the battle between the gods and the giants but also to the
Trojan war and the capture of Ilion. Before the entrance stand statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andriantes</span>\] of women
who have been priestesses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereiai</span>\] of Hērā and
of various heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\], including
Orestes. I say it this way because the statue that has an inscription on
it claiming that it represents the Emperor Augustus is really, they say,
the statue of Orestes. In the front-part-of-the-temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pro-nāos</span>\] are on the
one side ancient statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of the

The statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Hērā is seated on a throne
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thronos</span>\]; it \[= the
statue\] is huge in size, made of gold and ivory, and is a work of
Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\]. She is wearing \[on her head\] a garland

features Graces
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kharites</span>\] and Seasons
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hōrai</span>\] worked upon it,
and in one hand she holds a pomegranate while in the other a scepter
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skēptron</span>\]. About the
pomegranate … I must let go of this subject, since its story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] is somewhat
mystical \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-rrhētos</span>\].
The presence of a cuckoo seated on the scepter
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skēptron</span>\] they explain
by telling how, when Zeus lusted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erân</span>\] for Hērā as
virgin \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\], he
changed himself into this bird, and she caught it to be her plaything
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paignion</span>\]. This story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] and similar
things said about the gods I write down without accepting

but I write them down nevertheless.

By the side of Hērā stands what is said to be a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Hēbē
fashioned by Naukydes; it, too, is of ivory and gold. By its side is an
old statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Hērā on a column
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kiōn</span>\]. The oldest
statue is made of wild-pear wood, and was dedicated in Tiryns by
Peirasos, son of Argos, and when the Argives destroyed Tiryns they
carried it away to the Hēraion. I myself saw it, a small, seated statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\].

Of the votive offerings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\] the
following are worth speaking-about
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\]. There is an
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] upon
which is worked in relief the storied
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legomenon</span>\] wedding of
Hēbē and Hēraklēs. This is of silver, but the peacock dedicated by
‘King’ \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\]
Hadrian is of gold and gleaming stones. He dedicated it because they
hold the bird to be sacred to Hērā. Also deposited here are a golden
garland \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stephanos</span>\] and
a purple robe \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peplos</span>\],
offerings \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\]
of Nero.

Above this temple are the foundations of the earlier temple and such
parts of it as were spared by the flames. It had burned down because
sleep overpowered Khryseis, the priestess of Hērā, when the lamp before
the garlands set fire to them. Khryseis went to Tegea and supplicated
Athena <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aléā</span>. Although so
great a disaster had befallen them the Argives did not take down the

By the side of the road from Mycenae to Argos there is on the left hand

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\], as I
discovered, from the local-population-nearby
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">proskhōrioi</span>\] here as
well \[as inside the walls of Mycenae\], but the greatest honors are
paid to him in Seriphos and among the Athenians, who have a precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] sacred to
Perseus and an altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of Dictys and
Klymene, who are called the saviors

As one advancxes in the Argive territory from this hero-shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōion</span>\], therfe is on
the right the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Thyestes.
On it is a ram \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krios</span>\]
made of stone, because Thyestes obtained a golden lamb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arēn</span>\] after seducing
his brother’s wife. Atreus was not restrained by prudence
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logismos</span>\] from
retaliating, but contrived the slaughter of the children of Thyestes and
the banquet that is sung about in songs.

But as to what followed, I cannot say for certain whether Aigisthos
began the injustice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">adikiā</span>\] or whether
Agamemnon was first to commit injustice in killing Tantalos the son of
Thyestes. It is said that Tantalos had lived-with
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-oikeîn</span>\]Clytaemnestra,
having received her from Tyndareus when she was still a virgin. I myself
do not wish to condemn them of having been wicked by nature
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phusis</span>\]; but if the
pollution \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">miasma</span>\] of
Pelops and the avenging spirit of Myrtilos dogged their steps so long,
it was after all only consistent that the Pythian priestess said to the
Spartan Glaukos, the son of Epikydes, who consulted her about breaking
his oath, that the punishment for this also comes upon the descendants.

A short distance beyond the Rams

and a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Demeter
Mysia, so named after a man Mysios who, say the Argives, was another one
of those who acted as a host
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenos</span>\] to Demeter. In
any case, this sanctuary has no roof, but inside it is another shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\], built of baked

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Korē</span>\], Pluto
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ploutōn</span>\], and Demeter.
Farther on is the river called Inakhos, and on the other side of it an
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of Hēlios
\[the Sun\]. After this you will come to a gate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pulē</span>\] named after the

The Argives are the only Greeks that I know of who have been divided
into three kingdoms. For in the reign of Anaxagoras, son of Argeus, son
of Megapenthes, the women were smitten with madness, and straying from
their homes they roamed about the country, until Melampos the son of
Amythaon cured them of the plague on condition that he himself and his
brother Bias had a share of the kingdom equal to that of Anaxagoras. Now
descended from Bias five men, Neleids on their mother’s side, occupied
the throne for four generations down to Kyanippos, son of Aigialeus, and
descended from Melampos six men in six generations down to Amphilokhos,
son of Amphiaraos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.18.5">

But the native house of the lineage of Anaxagoras ruled longer than the
other two. For Iphis, son of Alector, son of Anaxagoras, left the throne
to Sthenelus, son of Capaneus his brother. After the capture of Troy,
Amphilokhos migrated to the people now called the Amphilochians, and,
Kyanippos having died without issue, Cylarabes, son of Sthenelus, became
sole king. However, he too left no offspring, and Argos was seized by
Orestes, son of Agamemnon, who was a neighbor. Besides his ancestral
dominion, he had extended his rule over the greater part of Arcadia and
had succeeded to the throne of Sparta; he also had a contingent of
allies from Phokis always ready to help him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.18.6">

When Orestes became king of the Lacedaemonians, they themselves
consented to accept him for they considered that the sons of the
daughter of Tyndareus had a claim to the throne prior to that of
Nikostratos and Megapenthes, who were sons of Menelaos by a slave woman.
On the death of Orestes, there succeeded to the throne Tisamenus, the
son of Orestes and of Hermione, the daughter of Menelaos. The mother of
Penthilos, the bastard son of Orestes, was, according to the poet

It was in the reign of this Tisamenus that the Herakleidai returned to
the Peloponnesus; they were Temenus and Kresphontes, the sons of
Aristomakhos, together with the sons of the third brother, Aristodemos,
who had died. Their claim to Argos and to the throne of Argos was, in my
opinion, most just, because Tisamenus was descended from Pelops, but the
Herakleidai were descendants of Perseus. Tyndareus himself, they made
out, had been expelled by Hippokoön, and they said that Hēraklēs, having
killed Hippokoön and his sons, had given the land in trust to Tyndareus.
They gave the same kind of account about Messenia also, that it had been
given in trust to Nestor by Hēraklēs after he had taken Pylos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.18.8">

So they expelled Tisamenus from Lacedaemon and Argos, and the
descendants of Nestor from Messenia, namely Alkmaion, son of Sillus, son
of Thrasymedes, Peisistratos, son of Peisistratos, and the sons of
Paion, son of Antilokhos, and with them Melanthos, son of Andropompus,
son of Borus, son of Penthilos, son of Periclymenus. So Tisamenus and
his sons went with his army to the land that is now Achaea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.18.9">

To what people Peisistratos retreated I do not know, but the rest of the
Neleidai went to Athens, and the clans of the Painonidai and of the
Alkmaionidai were named after them. Melanthos even came to the throne,
having deposed Thymoetes the son of Oxyntes; for Thymoetes was the last
Athenian king descended from Theseus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.1">

It is not to my purpose that I should set forth here the history of
Kresphontes and of the sons of Aristodemos. But Temenus openly employed,
instead of his sons, Delphontes, son of Antimakhos, son of Thrasyanor,
son of Ktesippos, son of Hēraklēs, as general in war and as adviser on
all occasions. Even before this he had made him his son-in-law, while
Hyrnetho was his favorite daughter; he was accordingly suspected of
intending to divert the throne to her and Delphontes. For this reason
his sons plotted against him, and Ceisus, the eldest of them, seized the
kingdom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.2">

But from the earliest times the Argives have loved freedom and
self-government, and they limited to the utmost the authority of their
kings, so that to Medon, the son of Ceisus, and to his descendants was
left a kingdom that was such only in name. Meltas, the son of Lacedas,
the tenth descendant of Medon, was condemned by the people and deposed
altogether from the kingship.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.3">

The most famous building in the city of Argos is the sanctuary of Apollo
Lykios (wolf-god). The modern statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] was made by
the Athenian Attalos, but the original temple and wooden-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] were the
offering of Danaos. I am of opinion that in those days all statues
called <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoana</span>, especially
Egyptian ones, were made of wood. The reason why Danaos founded a
sanctuary of Apollo Lykios was this. On coming to Argos he claimed the
kingdom against Gelanor, the son of Sthenelas. Many plausible arguments
were brought forward by both parties, and those of Sthenelas were
considered as fair as those of his opponent; so the people, who were
sitting in judgment, put off, they say, the decision to the following
day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.4">

At dawn a wolf fell upon a herd of oxen that was pasturing before the
wall, and attacked and fought with the bull that was the leader of the
herd. It occurred to the Argives that Gelanor was like the bull and
Danaos like the wolf, for as the wolf will not live with men, so Danaos
up to that time had not lived with them. It was because the wolf
overcame the bull that Danaos won the kingdom. Accordingly, believing
that Apollo had brought the wolf on the herd, he founded a sanctuary of
Apollo Lykios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.5">

Here is dedicated the throne of Danaos, and here Is placed a statue of
Biton, in the form of a man carrying a bull on his shoulders. According
to the poet Lykeas, when the Argives were holding a sacrifice to Zeus at
Nemeā, Biton by sheer physical strength took up a bull and carried it
there. Next to this statue is a fire which they keep burning, calling it
the fire of Phoroneus. For they do not admit that fire was given to
mankind by Prometheus, but insist in assigning the discovery of fire to
Phoroneus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.6">

As to the wooden images of Aphrodite and Hermes, the one they say was
made by Epeios, while the other is a votive offering of Hypermnestra.
She was the only one of the daughters of Danaos who neglected his
command,[^177] and was accordingly brought to justice by him, because be
considered that his life was in danger so long as Lynkeus was at large,
and that the refusal to share in the crime of her sisters increased the
disgrace of the contriver of the deed. On her trial she was acquitted by
the Argives, and to commemorate her escape she dedicated an image of
Aphrodite, the Bringer of Nike.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.7">

Within the temple is a statue of Ladas, the swiftest runner of his time,
and one of Hermes with a tortoise which he has caught to make a lyre.
Before the temple is a pit with a relief representing a fight between a
bull and a wolf, and with them a maiden throwing a rock at the bull. The
maiden is thought to be Artemis. Danaos dedicated these, and some
pillars hard by and wooden images of Zeus and Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.19.8">

Here are tombs; one is that of Linos, the son of Apollo by Psamathe, the
daughter of Krotopos; the other, they say, is that of Linos the poet.
The story of the latter Linos is more appropriate to another part of my
narrative, and so I omit it here, while I have already given the history
of the son of Psamathe in my account of Megara. After these is an image
of Apollo, God of Streets, and an altar of Zeus, God of Rain, where
those who were helping Polyneikes in his efforts to be restored to
Thebes swore an oath together that they would either capture Thebes or
die. As to the tomb of Prometheus, their account seems to me to be less
probable than that of the Opuntians, but they hold to it nevertheless.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.1">

Passing over a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of Creugas, a
boxer, and a trophy that was set up to celebrate a victory over the
Corinthians, you come to a seated statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus
Meilikhios \[‘benign’\], made of white marble by Polyclitus
\[Polykleitos\].[^178] I discovered that it was made for the following
reason. Ever since the Lacedaemonians began to make war upon the Argives
there was no cessation of hostilities until Philip, the son of Amyntas,
forced them to stay within the original boundaries of their territories.
Before this, if the Lacedaemonians were not engaged on some business
outside the Peloponnesus, they were always trying to annex a piece of
Argive territory; or if they were busied with a war beyond their borders
it was the turn of the Argives to retaliate.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.2">

When the hatred of both sides was at its height, the Argives resolved to
maintain a thousand picked men. The commander appointed over them was
the Argive Bryas. His general behavior to the men of the people was
violent, and a girl who was being taken to the bridegroom he seized from
those who were escorting her and ravished. When night came on, the girl
waited until he was asleep and put out his eyes. Detected in the
morning, she took refuge as a suppliant with the people. When they did
not give her up to the Thousand for punishment both sides took up arms;
the people won the day, and in their anger left none of their opponents
alive.[^179] Subsequently they had recourse to purifications for
shedding kindred blood; among other things they dedicated a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus
Meilikhios \[‘benign’\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.3">

Hard by are Kleobis and Biton carved in relief on stone, themselves
drawing the carriage and taking in it their mother to the sanctuary of
Hērā. Opposite them is a sanctuary of Nemean Zeus, and an upright bronze
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the
god made by Lysippos. Going forward from this you see on the right the
tomb of Phoroneus, to whom even in our time they bring offerings as to a
hero. Over against the Nemean Zeus is a temple of Fortune, which must be
very old if it be the one in which Palamedes dedicated the dice that he
had invented.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.4">

The tomb near this they call that of the maenad Chorea, saying that she
was one of the women who joined Dionysus in his expedition against
Argos, and that Perseus, being victorious in the battle, put most of the
women to the sword. To the rest they gave a common grave, but to Chorea
they gave burial apart because of her high rank.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.5">

A little farther on is a sanctuary of the Seasons. On coming back from
here you see statues of Polyneikes, the son of Oedipus, and of all the
chieftains who with him were killed in battle at the wall of Thebes.
These men Aeschylus has reduced to the number of seven only, although
there were more chiefs than this in the expedition, from Argos, from
Messene, with some even from Arcadia. But the Argives have adopted the
number seven from the drama of Aeschylus, and near to their statues are
the statues of those who took Thebes: Aigialeus, son of Adrastos;
Promakhos, son of Parthenopaeus, son of Talaos; Polydoros, son of
Hippomedon; Thersandros; Alkmaion and Amphilokhos, the sons of
Amphiaraos; Diomedes, and Sthenelus. Among their company were also
Euryalus, son of Mecisteus, and Adrastos and Timeas, sons of Polyneikes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.6">

Not far from the statues are shown the tomb of Danaos and a cenotaph of
the Argives who met their death at Troy or on the journey home. Here
there is also a sanctuary of Zeus the Savior. Beyond it is a building
where the Argive women bewail Adonis. On the right of the entrance is
the sanctuary of Kephisos. It is said that the water of this river was
not utterly destroyed by Poseidon, but that just in this place, where
the sanctuary is, it can be heard flowing under the earth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.7">

Beside the sanctuary of Kephisos is a head of Medusa made of stone,
which is said to be another of the works of the Cyclopes. The ground
behind it is called even at the present time the Place of Judgment,
because it was here that they say Hypermnestra was brought to judgment
by Danaos. Not far from this is a theater. In it are some noteworthy
sights, including a representation of a man killing another, namely the
Argive Perilaos, the son of Alcenor, killing the Spartan Othryadas.
Before this, Perilaos had succeeded in winning the prize for wrestling
at the Nemean games.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.8">

Above the theater is a sanctuary of Aphrodite, and before the image is a
slab with a representation crafted on it in relief of Telesilla, the
lyric poetess. Her books lie scattered at her feet, and she herself
holds in her hand an helmet, which she is looking at and is about to
place on her head. Telesilla was a distinguished woman who was
especially renowned for her poetry. It happened that the Argives had
suffered an awful defeat at the hands of Kleomenes, the son of
Anaxandrides, and the Lacedaemonians. Some fell in the actual fighting;
others, who had fled to the grove of Argos, also perished. At first they
left sanctuary under an agreement, which was treacherously broken, and
the survivors, when they realized this, were burned to death in the
grove. So when Kleomenes led his troops to Argos there were no men to
defend it.[^180]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.9">

But Telesilla mounted on the wall all the slaves and such as were
incapable of bearing arms through youth or old age, and she herself,
collecting the arms in the sanctuaries and those that were left in the
houses, armed the women of vigorous age, and then posted them where she
knew the enemy would attack. When the Lacedaemonians came on, the women
were not dismayed at their battlecry, but stood their ground and fought
valiantly. Then the Lacedaemonians, realizing that to destroy the women
would be an invidious success while defeat would mean a shameful
disaster, gave way before the women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.20.10">

This fight had been foretold by the Pythian priestess in the oracle
quoted by Herodotus, who perhaps understood to what it referred and
perhaps did not:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

But when the time shall come that the female conquers in battle,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Driving away the male, and wins great glory in Argos,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Many an Argive woman will tear both cheeks in her sorrow.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Such are the words of the oracle referring to the exploit of the women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.1">

Having descended thence, and having turned again to the marketplace, we
come to the tomb of Cerdo, the wife of Phoroneus, and to a temple of
Asklepios. The sanctuary of Artemis, surnamed Persuasion, is another
offering of Hypermnestra after winning the trial to which she was
brought by her father because of Lynkeus. Here there is also a bronze
statue of Aeneas, and a place called Delta. I intentionally do not
discuss the origin of the name, because I could not accept the
traditional accounts.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.2">

In front of it stands an altar of Zeus Phyxios, and near is the tomb of
Hypermnestra, the mother of Amphiaraos, the other tomb being that of
Hypermnestra, the daughter of Danaos, with whom is also buried Lynkeus.
Opposite these is the tomb of Talaos, the son of Bias; the history of
Bias and his descendants I have already given.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.3">

A sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of
Athena <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Salpinx</span>
\[‘Trumpet’\], they say, was founded by Hēgeleōs. This Hēgeleōs, they
also say, was the son of Tyrsenos, and Tyrsenos was the son of Hēraklēs
and the Lydian woman; Tyrsenos invented the trumpet
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">salpinx</span>\], and
Hēgeleōs, the son of Tyrsenos , taught the Dorians who were with Tēmenos
the sound \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">psophos</span>\] of
the instrument
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">organon</span>\]. It is for

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ep-onomazein</span>\] for
Athena, <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Salpinx</span>
\[‘Trumpet’\]. In front of the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāós</span>\] of Athena is,
they say, the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Epimenides.
They also say that the Spartans \[Lakedaimonioi\] made war upon the
people of Knossos and took Epimenides alive; they then put him to death
for not prophesying
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteuesthai</span>\] for them
things that were fitting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aisia</span>\], and they \[=

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.4">

The building of white marble in just about the middle of the marketplace
is not, as the Argives declare, a trophy in honor of a victory over
Pyrrhos of Epeiros, but it can be shown that his body was burned here,
and that this is his monument, on which are carved in relief the
elephants and his other instruments of warfare. This building then was
set up where the pyre stood, but the bones of Pyrrhos lie in the
sanctuary of Demeter, beside which, as I have shown in my account of
Attica, his death occurred. At the entrance to this sanctuary of Demeter
you can see a bronze shield of Pyrrhos hanging dedicated over the door.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.5">

Not far from the building in the marketplace of Argos is a mound of
earth, in which they say lies the head of the Gorgon Medusa. I omit the
miraculous, but give the rational parts of the story about her. After
the death of her father, Phorcus, she reigned over those living around
Lake Tritonis, going out hunting and leading the Libyans to battle. On
one such occasion, when she was encamped with an army over against the
forces of Perseus, who was followed by picked troops from the
Peloponnesus, she was assassinated by night. Perseus, admiring her
beauty even in death, cut off her head and carried it to show the
Greeks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.6">

But Prokles, the son of Eucrates, a Carthaginian, thought a different
account more plausible than the preceding. It is as follows. Among the
incredible monsters to be found in the Libyan desert are wild men and
wild women. Prokles affirmed that he had seen a man from them who had
been brought to Rome. So he guessed that a woman wandered from them,
reached Lake Tritonis, and harried the neighbors until Perseus killed
her; Athena was supposed to have helped him in this exploit, because the
people who live around Lake Tritonis are sacred to her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.7">

In Argos, by the side of this monument of the Gorgon, is the tomb of
Gorgophone (Gorgon-kilIer), the daughter of Perseus. As soon as you hear
the name you can understand the reason why it was given her. On the
death of her husband, Perieres, the son of Aeolus, whom she married when
a virgin, she married Oibalos, being the first woman, they say, to marry
a second time; for before this wives were accustomed, on the death of
their husbands, to live as widows.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.8">

In front of the tomb is a trophy of stone made to commemorate a victory
over an Argive Laphaes. When this man was tyrant I write what the
Argives themselves say concerning themselves—the people rose up against
him and cast him out. He fled to Sparta, and the Lacedaemonians tried to
restore him to power, but were defeated by the Argives, who killed the
greater part of them and Laphaes as well. Not far from the trophy is the
sanctuary of Leto; the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is a work of
Praxiteles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.9">

The statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of
the maiden beside the goddess they call Chloris (Pale), saying that she
was a daughter of Niobe, and that she was called Meliboea at the first.
When the children of Amphion were destroyed by Apollo and Artemis, she
alone of her sisters, along with Amyclas, escaped; their escape was due
to their prayers to Leto. Meliboea was struck so pale by her fright, not
only at the time but also for the rest of her life, that even her name
was accordingly changed from Meliboea to Chloris.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.21.10">

Now the Argives say that these two built originally the temple to Leto,
but I think that none of Niobe’s children survived, for I place more
reliance than others on the poetry of Homer, one of whose verses bears
out my view:Though they were only two, yet they gave all to
destruction.[^181] So Homer knows that the house of Amphion was utterly
overthrown.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.22.1">

The temple of Hērā Anthea (Flowery) is on the right of the sanctuary of
Leto, and before it is a tomb of women. They were killed in a battle
against the Argives under Perseus, having come from the Aegean Islands
to help Dionysus in war; for which reason they are surnamed Haliai
(Women of the Sea). Facing the tomb of the women is a sanctuary of
Demeter, surnamed Pelasgian from Pelasgus, son of Triopas, its founder,
and not far from the sanctuary is the tomb of Pelasgus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.22.2">

Opposite the tomb is a small bronze vessel supporting ancient images
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Artemis,
Zeus, and Athena. Now Lykeas in his poem says that the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is of Zeus
Mekhaneus (Contriver), and that here the Argives who set out against
Troy swore to persist in the war until they either took Troy or met
their end fighting. Others have said that in the bronze vessel lie the
bones of Tantalos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.22.3">

Now that the Tantalos is buried here who was the son of Thyestes or
Broteas (both accounts are given) and married Clytaemnestra before
Agamemnon did, I will not gainsay; but the tomb of him who is said to be
the son of Zeus and Pluto \[Ploutō feminine\]—it is worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\]—is on Mount
Sipylos. I know because I saw it. Moreover, no constraint came upon him
to flee from Sipylos, such as afterwards forced Pelops to run away when
Ilus the Phrygian launched an army against him. But I must pursue the
inquiry no further. The ritual performed at the pit hard by they say was
instituted by Nikostratos, a native. Even at the present day they throw
into the pit burning torches in honor of the Maiden who is daughter of
Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.22.4">

Here is a sanctuary of Poseidon, surnamed Prosklystios (Flooder), for
they say that Poseidon inundated the greater part of the country because
Inakhos and his assessors decided that the land belonged to Hērā and not
to him. Now it was Hērā who induced Poseidon to send the sea back, but
the Argives made a sanctuary to Poseidon Prosklystios at the spot where
the tide ebbed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.22.5">

Going on a little further you see the tomb of Argos, reputed to be the
son of Zeus and Niobe, daughter of Phoroneus. After these comes a temple
of the Dioskouroi. The statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] represent
the Dioskouroi themselves and their sons, Anaxis and Mnasinous, and with
them are their mothers, Hilaeira and Phoebe. They are of ebony wood, and
were made by Dipoinos and Skyllis. The horses, too, are mostly of ebony,
but there is a little ivory also in their construction.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.22.6">

Near the Lords is a sanctuary of Eilethyia, dedicated by Helen when,
Theseus having gone away with Peirithoös to Thesprotia, Aphidna had been
captured by the Dioskouroi and Helen was being brought to Lacedaemon.
For it is said that she was with child, was delivered In Argos, and
founded there the sanctuary of Eilethyia, giving the daughter she bore
to Clytaemnestra, who was already wedded to Agamemnon, while she herself
subsequently married Menelaos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.22.7">

And on this matter the poets Euphorion of Khalkis and Alexander of
Pleuron, and even before them, Stesichorus of Himera, agree with the
Argives in asserting that Iphigeneia was the daughter of Theseus.[^182]
Over against the sanctuary of Eilethyia is a temple of Hekate, and the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is a
work of Scopas. This one is of stone, while the bronze statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] opposite,
also of Hekate, were made respectively by Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\] and
his brother Naukydes, son of Mothon.

Electryon, who, Homer says, was killed by Tleptolemos, the son of
Hēraklēs for which homicide Tleptolemos was banished from Argos. On
turning a little aside from the road to Cylarabis and to the gate there,

As one goes from here along a road
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hodos</span>\] called Hollow
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Koilē</span>\], there is on
the right a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Dionysus; the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], they
say, is from Euboea. For when the Greeks, as they were returning
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] from
Troy, met with the shipwreck at Caphereus, those of the Argives who were
able to escape to land suffered from cold and hunger. Having prayed that
someone of the gods should prove himself a savior
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sōtēr</span>\] in their
present distress, straightway as they advanced they came upon a cave of
Dionysus; in the cave was a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the god,
and on this occasion wild she-goats had gathered there to escape from
the storm. These the Argives killed, using the flesh as food and the
skins as clothing. When the storm was over and the Argives, having
refitted their ships, were returning
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] homeward,
they took with them the wooden-image
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] from the cave,
and continue to honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmân</span>\] it to the
present day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.23.2">

Very near to the temple of Dionysus you will see the house
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikiā</span>\][^183] of
Adrastos, and, further on from there, a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Amphiaraos,
and, beyond the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Eriphyle.
Next to these is a precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] of Asklepios,
and, after them, a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Baton. Now
Baton belonged to the same lineage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">genos</span>\] as Amphiaraos,
to the Melampodidai, and was-charioteer
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēniokheîn</span>\] for him
\[=Amphiaraos\] when that one went forth to battle. When the rout
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tropē</span>\] took place at
the wall of Thebes, an opening-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khasma</span>\] of the earth
happened, receiving Amphiaraos and his chariot, and the opening made him
disappear \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aphanizein</span>\]
together with this Baton.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.23.3">

As one comes back from Hollow-Road \[Koilē\], one sees what they say is
the tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of
Hyrnetho. If it is merely empty
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kenos</span>, = a cenotaph\],
serving no other purpose than a memorializing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] of the woman,
then the things they say are likely
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikóta</span>\] but if they
think \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] that
the corpse \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nekros</span>\]
lies here, then I cannot believe it. If there is anyone who has not
learned \[as I have\] the things thought by the people of Epidauros, let
someone like that go on and believe it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.23.4">

The most famous sanctuary of Asklepios at Argos contains at the present
day a white-marble statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the god
seated, and by his side stands Hygieia. There are also seated figures of
Xenophilus and Straton, who made the statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\]. The
original founder of the sanctuary was Sphyrus, son of Makhaon and
brother of the Alexanor who is honored among the Sikyonians in Titane.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.23.5">

The Argives, like the Athenians and Sikyonians, worship Artemis Pheraia,
and they, too, assert that the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the goddess
was brought from Pherai in Thessaly. But I cannot agree with them when
they say that in Argos are the tombs of Deianeira, the daughter of
Oineus, and of Helenos, son of Priam, and that there is among them the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Athena that was brought from Troy, thus causing the capture of that
city. For the Palladium, as it is called, was manifestly brought to
Italy by Aeneas. As to Deianeira, we know that her death took place near
Trakhis and not in Argos, and her tomb is near Herakleia, at the foot of
Mount Oitē.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.23.6">

The story of Helenos, son of Priam, I have already given: that he went
to Epeiros with Pyrrhos, the son of Achilles; that, wedded to
Andromache, he was guardian to the children of Pyrrhos and that the
district called Kestrine received its name from Kestrinos, son of
Helenos. Now even the guides of the Argives themselves are aware that
their account is not entirely correct. Nevertheless they hold to their
opinion, for it is not easy to make the multitude change their views.
The Argives have other things worth seeing;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.23.7">

for instance, an underground building over which was the bronze chamber
which Akrisios once made to guard his daughter. Perilaos, however, when
he became tyrant, pulled it down. Besides this building there is the
tomb of Krotopos and a temple of Cretan Dionysus. For they say that the
god, having made war on Perseus, afterwards laid aside his enmity, and
received great honors at the hands of the Argives, including this
precinct set specially apart for himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.23.8">

It was afterwards called the precinct of the Cretan god, because, when
Ariadne died, Dionysus buried her here. But Lykeas says that when the
temple was being rebuilt an earthenware coffin was found, and that it
was Ariadne’s. He also said that both he himself and other Argives had
seen it. Near the temple of Dionysus is a temple of Aphrodite the
celestial one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ourania</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.24.1">

The citadel they call Larisa, after the daughter of Pelasgus. After her
were also named two of the cities in Thessaly, the one by the sea and
the one by the river Pēneios. As you go up the citadel you come to the
sanctuary of Hērā of the Height, and also a temple of Apollo, which is
said to have been first built by Pythaeus when he came from Delphi. The
present statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]
is a bronze standing figure called Apollo Deiradiotes, because this
place, too, is called Deiras (Ridge). Oracular responses are still given
here, and the oracle acts in the following way. There is a woman who
prophesies, being debarred from intercourse with a man. Every month a
lamb is sacrificed at night, and the woman, after tasting the blood,
becomes inspired by the god.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.24.2">

Adjoining the temple of Apollo Deiradiotes is a sanctuary of Athena
Oxyderces (Sharp-sighted), dedicated by Diomedes, because once when he
was fighting at Troy the goddess removed the mist from his eyes.
Adjoining it is the race-course, in which they hold the games in honor
of Nemean Zeus and the festival of Hērā. As you go to the citadel there
is on the left of the road another tomb of the children of Aigyptos. For
here are the heads apart from the bodies, which are at Lerna. For it was
at Lerna that the youths were murdered, and when they were dead their
wives cut off their heads, to prove to their father that they had done
the dreadful deed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.24.3">

On the top of Larisa is a temple of Zeus, surnamed Larisaean, which has
no roof; the wooden statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] I found no
longer standing upon its pedestal. There is also a temple of Athena
worth seeing. Here are placed votive offerings, including a wooden image
of Zeus, which has two eyes in the natural place and a third on its
forehead. This Zeus, they say, was a paternal god of Priam, the son of
Laomedon, set up in the uncovered part of his court, and when Troy was
taken by the Greeks Priam took sanctuary at the altar of this god. When
the spoils were divided, Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus, received the
image, and for this reason it has been dedicated here.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.24.4">

The reason for its three eyes one might infer to be this. That Zeus is
king in the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] is a saying
common to all men. As for him who is said to rule under the earth, there
is a verse of Homer which calls him, too, Zeus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Zeus of the Underworld
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kata-khthonios</span>\], and
the dreaded \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epainē</span>\]
Persephoneia.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 9.457

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

The god in the sea, also, is called Zeus by Aeschylus, the son of
Euphorion. So whoever made the image made it with three eyes, as
signifying that this same god rules in all the three ‘allotments’ of the
Universe, as they are called.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.24.5">

From Argos are roads to various parts of the Peloponnesus, including one
to Teges on the side towards Arcadia. On the right is Mount Lykone,
which has trees on it, chiefly cypresses. On the top of the mountain is
built a sanctuary of Artemis Orthia (of the Steep), and there have been
made white-marble statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Apollo,
Leto, and Artemis, which they say are works of Polyclitus
\[Polykleitos\]. On descending again from the mountain you see on the
left of the highway a temple of Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.24.6">

A little farther on there is on the right of the road a mountain called
Chaon. At its foot grow cultivated trees, and here the water of the
Erasinos rises to the surface. Up to this point it flows from Stymphalos
in Arcadia, just as the Rheitoi, near the sea at Eleusis, flow from the
Euripus. At the places where the Erasinos gushes forth from the mountain
they sacrifice to Dionysus and to Pan, and to Dionysus they also hold a
festival called Tyrbe (Throng).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.24.7">

On returning to the road that leads to Tegea you see Cenchreae on the
right of what is called the Wheel. Why the place received this name they
do not say. Perhaps in this case also it was Cenchrias, son of Peirene,
that caused it to be so called. Here are common graves of the Argives
who conquered the Lacedaemonians in battle at Hysiai.[^184] This fight
took place, I discovered, when Peisistratos was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the fourth year of the twenty-seventh Olympiad, in which the Athenian,
Eurybotos, won the foot-race. On coming down to a lower level you reach
the ruins of Hysiai, which once was a city in Argolis, and here it is
that they say the Lacedaemonians suffered their reverse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.1">

The road from Argos to Mantineia is not the same as that to Tegea, but
begins from the gate at the Ridge. On this road is a sanctuary built
with two rooms, having an entrance on the west side and another on the
east. At the latter is a wooden-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] of Aphrodite,
and at the west entrance one of Ares. They say that the statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] are votive
offerings of Polyneikes and of the Argives who joined him in the
campaign to redress his wrongs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.2">

Farther on from here, across the torrent called Kharadros (Gully), is
Oinoe, named, the Argives say, after Oineus. The story is that Oineus,
who was king in Aetolia, on being driven from his throne by the sons of
Agrios, took refuge with Diomedes at Argos, who aided him by an
expedition into Calydonia, but said that he could not remain with him,
and urged Oineus to accompany him, if he wished, to Argos. When he came,
he gave him all the attention that it was right to give a father’s
father, and on his death buried him here. After him the Argives name the
place Oinoe.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.3">

Above Oinoe is Mount Artemisios, with a sanctuary of Artemis on the top.
On this mountain are also the springs of the river Inakhos. For it
really has springs, though the water does not run far.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.4">

Here I found nothing else that is worth seeing. There is another road,
that leads to Lyrcea from the gate at the Ridge. The story is that to
this place came Lynkeus, being the only one of the fifty brothers to
escape death, and that on his escape he raised a beacon here. Now to
raise the beacon was the signal he had agreed with Hypermnestra to give
if he should escape Danaos and reach a place of safety. She also, they
say, lighted a beacon on Larisa as a sign that she too was now out of
danger. For this reason the Argives hold every year a beacon festival.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.5">

At the first the place was called Lyncea; its present name is derived
from Lyrcus, a bastard son of Abas, who afterwards dwelled there. Among
the ruins are several things not worth mentioning, besides a figure of
Lyrcus upon a slab. The distance from Argos to Lyrcea is about sixty
stadium-lengths, and the distance from Lyrcea to Orneaiis the same.
Homer in the Catalogue makes no mention of the city Lyrcea, because at
the time of the Greek expedition against Troy it already lay deserted;
Omeae, however, was inhabited, and in his poem he places it[^185] on the
list before Phleious and Sikyon, which order corresponds to the position
of the towns in the Argive territory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.6">

The name is derived from Orneus, the son of Erekhtheus. This Orneus
begat Peteos, and Peteos begat Menestheus, who, with a body of
Athenians, helped Agamemnon to destroy the kingdom of Priam. From him
then did Orneai get its name, and afterwards the Argives removed all its
citizens, who thereupon came to live at Argos. At Orneaiare a sanctuary
and an upright wooden image of Artemis; there is besides a temple
devoted to all the gods in common. On the further side of Orneaiare
Sikyonia and Phliasia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.7">

On the way from Argos to Epidauria there is on the right a building made
very like a pyramid, and on it in relief are created shields of the
Argive shape. Here took place a fight for the throne between Proitos and
Akrisios; the contest, they say, ended in a draw, and a reconciliation
resulted afterwards, as neither could gain a decisive victory. The story
is that they and their hosts were armed with shields, which were first
used in this battle. For those that fell on either side was built here a
common tomb, as they were fellow citizens and kinsmen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.8">

Going on from here and turning to the right, you come to the ruins of
Tiryns. The Tirynthians also were removed by the Argives, who wished to
make Argos more powerful by adding to the population. The hero Tiryns,
from whom the city derived its name, is said to have been a son of
Argos, a son of Zeus. The wall, which is the only part of the ruins
still remaining, is a work of the Cyclopes made of unfinished stones,
each stone being so big that a pair of mules could not move the smallest
from its place to the slightest degree. Long ago small stones were so
inserted that each of them binds the large blocks firmly together.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.9">

Going down seawards, you come to the chambers of the daughters of
Proitos. On returning to the highway you will reach Medea on the left
hand. They say that Electryon, the father of Alkmene, was king of Medea,
but in my time nothing was left of it except the foundations.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.25.10">

On the straight road to Epidaurus is a village Lessa, in which is a
temple of Athena with a wooden image exactly like the one on the citadel
Larisa. Above Lessa is Mount Arachnaeus, which long ago, in the time of
Inakhos, was named Sapyselaton. On it are altars to Zeus and Hērā. When
rain is needed they sacrifice to them here.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.1">

At Lessa the Argive territory joins that of Epidaurus. But before you
reach Epidaurus itself you will come to the sanctuary of Asklepios. Who
dwelled in this land before Epidaurus came to it I do not know, nor
could I discover from the natives the descendants of Epidaurus either.
But the last king before the Dorians arrived in the Peloponnesus was,
they say, Pityreus, a descendant of Ion, son of Xuthus, and they relate
that he handed over the land to Deiphontes and the Argives without a
struggle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.2">

He went to Athens with his people and dwelled there, while Deiphontes
and the Argives took possession of Epidauria. These on the death of
Temenus seceded from the other Argives; Deiphontes and Hyrnetho through
hatred of the sons of Temenus, and the army with them, because it
respected Deiphontes and Hyrnetho more than Ceisus and his brothers.
Epidaurus, who gave the land its name, was, the people of Elis say, a
son of Pelops but, according to Argive opinion and the poem the Great
Eoeae, the father of Epidaurus was Argos, son of Zeus, while the
Epidaurians maintain that Epidaurus was the child of Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.3">

That the land is especially sacred to Asklepios is due to the following
reason. The Epidaurians say that Phlegyas came to the Peloponnesus,
ostensibly to see the land, but really to spy out the number of the
inhabitants, and whether the greater part of them was warlike. For
Phlegyas was the greatest soldier of his time, and making forays in all
directions he carried off the crops and lifted the cattle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.4">

When he went to the Peloponnesus, he was accompanied by his daughter,
who all along had kept hidden from her father that she was with child by
Apollo. In the country of the Epidaurians she bore a son, and exposed
him on the mountain called Nipple at the present day, but then named
Myrtium. As the child lay exposed he was given milk by one of the goats
that pastured about the mountain, and was guarded by the watchdog of the
herd. And when Aresthanas (for this was the herdsman’s name)

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.5">

discovered that the tale of the goats was not full, and that the
watchdog also was absent from the herd, he left, they say, no stone
unturned, and on finding the child desired to take him up. As he drew
near he saw lightning that flashed from the child, and, thinking that it
was something divine, as in fact it was, he turned away. Presently it
was reported over every land and sea that Asklepios was discovering
everything he wished to heal the sick, and that he was raising dead men
to life.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.6">

There is also another tradition concerning him. Korōnis, they say, when
pregnant with Asklepios, had intercourse with Ischys, son of Elatos. She
was killed by Artemis to punish her for the insult done to Apollo, but
when the pyre was already lit on fire Hermes is said to have snatched
the child from the flames.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.7">

The third account is, in my opinion, the farthest from the truth; it
makes Asklepios to be the son of Arsinoe, the daughter of Leukippos. For
when Apollophanes the Arcadian, came to Delphi and asked the god if
Asklepios was the son of Arsinoe and therefore a Messenian, the Pythian
priestess gave this response: —O Asklepios, born to bestow great joy
upon mortals, Pledge of the mutual love I enjoyed with Phlegyas’
daughter, Lovely Korōnis, whogave birth to you in rugged land Epidaurus.
This oracle makes it quite certain that Asklepios was not a son of
Arsinoe, and that the story was a fiction invented by Hesiod, or by one
of Hesiod’s interpolators, just to please the Messenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.8">

There is other evidence that the god was born in Epidaurus for I find
that the most famous sanctuaries of Asklepios had their origin from
Epidaurus. In the first place, the Athenians, who say that they gave a
share of their mystic rites to Asklepios, call this day of the festival
Epidauria, and they allege that their worship of Asklepios dates from
then. Again, when Arkhias, son of Aristaechmus, was healed in Epidauria
after spraining himself while hunting about Pindasus, he brought the
cult to Pergamon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.9">

From the one at Pergamon has been built in our own day the sanctuary of
Asklepios by the sea at Smyrna. Further, at Balagraiof the Cyreneans
there is an Asklepios called Healer, who like the others came from
Epidaurus. From the one at Cyrene was founded the sanctuary of Asklepios
at Lebene, in Crete. There is this difference between the Cyreneans and
the Epidaurians, that whereas the former sacrifice goats, it is against
the custom of the Epidaurians to do so.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.26.10">

That Asklepios was considered a god from the first, and did not receive
the title only in course of time, I infer from several signs, including
the evidence of Homer, who makes Agamemnon say about Makhaon:Talthybios,
with all speed go summon me hither Makhaon, mortal son of
Asklepios.[^186] As who should say, ‘human son of a god’.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.27.1">

The sacred grove of Asklepios is surrounded on all sides by boundary
marks. No death or birth takes place within the enclosure the same
custom prevails also in the island of Delos. All the offerings, whether
the offerer be one of the Epidaurians themselves or a stranger, are
entirely consumed within the bounds. At Titane too, I know, there is the
same rule.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.27.2">

The statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Asklepios \[inside his temple\] is, in size, half as big as the Olympian
Zeus in Athens, and is made of ivory and gold. An inscription reveals
that the artist was Thrasymedes, a Parian, son of Arignotos. The god is
sitting on a seat throne
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thronos</span>\] grasping a
staff \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">baktēriā</span>\]; the
other hand he is holding over the head of the serpent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakōn</span>\]; there is also
a figure of a dog lying by his side. On the throne
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thronos</span>\] are worked in
relief the deeds \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\]
of Argive heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\]—Bellerophontes
against the Chimaera, and Perseus, who has cut off the head of Medusa.
Over on the side of the temple is the place where the suppliants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiketai</span>\] of the god
fall asleep \[= go into a state of incubation\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.27.3">

Nearby \[= near the Temple of Asklepios\] has been built a circular
building \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma …
peripheres</span>\] of white marble, called Tholos, which is worthy of
viewing \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\]. In it
is a picture by Pausias representing Love, who has cast aside his bow
and arrows, and is carrying instead of them a lyre that he has taken up.
Here there is also another work of Pausias, Drunkenness drinking out of
a crystal cup. You can see even in the painting a crystal cup and a
woman’s face through it. Within the enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\] stood slabs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stēlai</span>\]; in my time
six remained, but in ancient times there were more. On them are

Asklepios, also the disease also from which each suffered, also the

Apart from the others is an ancient
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhaiā</span>\] slab
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stēlē</span>\]. It says \[that
is, the inscription on it says\] that Hippolytus dedicated twenty horses
to the god \[Asklepios\]. What is said by the people of Aricia agrees
with the inscription on this slab, that when Hippolytus was killed
because of the curses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ārai</span>\] of Theseus,
Asklepios resurrected
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-histanai</span>\] him from
the dead. When he came-back-to-life
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">authis biōnai</span>\] he
refused to forgive his father for rejecting his entreaties, and he went
to the people of Aricia in Italy. There he became king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileusai</span>\] and
dedicated a precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] to Artemis,
where down to my time there was a contest-for-prizes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">āthla</span>\]—a contest of
single-combat
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">monomakhiā</span>\]—and
\[among the prizes was the provision\] that the winner \[of the

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierâsthai</span>\] to the
goddess \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>

The people of Epidaurus have a theater
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theātron</span>\] within the
sacred space \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\],
and it is in my opinion very much worthy of viewing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\]. I say this
because, while the Roman theaters are far superior to those anywhere
else in their splendor, and the Arcadian theater at Megalopolis is
unequalled for size, what architect could seriously rival Polyclitus
\[Polykleitos\] in symmetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harmoniā</span>\] and beauty?
It was Polyclitus who built both this theater
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theātron</span>\] and the
circular building \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma …
peripheres</span>\]. Within the grove are a temple of Artemis, a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Epione, a
sanctuary of Aphrodite and Themis, a race-course consisting, like most
Greek race-courses, of a bank of earth, and a fountain worth seeing for
its roof and general splendor.

A Roman senator, Antoninus, made in our own day a bath of Asklepios and
a sanctuary of the gods they call Bountiful.[^187] He made also a temple
to Hygieia, Asklepios, and Apollo, the last two surnamed Egyptian. He
moreover restored the portico that was named the Portico of Cotys,
which, as the brick of which it was made had been unburned, had fallen
into utter ruin after it had lost its roof. As the Epidaurians about the
sanctuary were in great distress, because their women had no shelter in
which to be delivered and the sick breathed their last in the open, he
provided a dwelling, so that these grievances also were redressed. Here
at last was a place in which without sin a human being could die and a
woman be delivered.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.27.7">

Above the grove are the Nipple and another mountain called Cynortium; on
the latter is a sanctuary of Maleatian Apollo. The sanctuary itself is
an ancient one, but among the things Antoninus made for the Epidaurians
are various appurtenances for the sanctuary of the Maleatian, including
a reservoir into which the rainwater collects for their use.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.28.1">

The serpents, including a peculiar kind of a yellowish color, are
considered sacred to Asklepios, and are tame with men. These are
peculiar to Epidauria, and I have noticed that other lands have their
peculiar animals. For in Libya only are to be found land crocodiles at
least two cubits long; from India alone are brought, among other
creatures, parrots. But the big snakes that grow to more than thirty
cubits, such as are found in India and in Libya, are said by the
Epidaurians not to be serpents, but some other kind of creature.

As you go up to Mount Coryphum you see by the road an olive tree called
Twisted. It was Hēraklēs who gave it this shape by bending it round with
his hand, but I cannot say whether he set it to be a boundary mark
against the Asinaeans in Argolis, since in no land, which has been
depopulated, is it easy to discover the truth about the boundaries. On
the Top of the mountain there is a sanctuary of Artemis Coryphaea (of
the Peak), of which Telesilla made mention in an ode.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.28.3">

On going down to the city of the Epidaurians, you come to a place where
wild olives grow; they call it Hyrnethium. I will relate the story of
it, which is probable enough, as given by the Epidaurians. Ceisus and
the other sons of Temenus knew that they would grieve Deiphontes most if
they could find a way to part him and Hyrnetho. So Cerynes and Phalkes
(for Agraios, the youngest, disapproved of their plan) came to
Epidaurus. Staying their chariot under the wall, they sent a herald to
their sister, pretending that they wished to parley with her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.28.4">

When she obeyed their summons, the young men began to make many
accusations against Deiphontes, and besought her much that she would
return to Argos, promising, among other things, to give her to a husband
in every respect better than Deiphontes, one who ruled over more
subjects and a more prosperous country. But Hyrnetho, pained at their
words, gave as good as she had received, retorting that Deiphontes was a
dear husband to her, and had shown himself a blameless son-in-law to
Temenus; as for them, they ought to be called the murderers of Temenus
rather than his sons.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.28.5">

Without further reply the youths seized her, placed her in the chariot,
and drove away. An Epidaurian told Deiphontes that Cerynes and Phalkes
had gone, taking with them Hyrnetho against her will; he himself rushed
to the rescue with all speed, and as the Epidaurians learned the news
they reinforced him. On overtaking the runaways, Deiphontes shot Cerynes
and killed him, but he was afraid to shoot at Phalkes, who was holding
Hyrnetho, lest he should miss him and become the slayer of his wife; so
he closed with them and tried to get her away. But Phalkes, holding on
and dragging her with greater violence, killed her, as she was with
child.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.28.6">

Realizing what he had done to his sister, he began to drive the chariot
more recklessly, as he was anxious to gain a start before all the
Epidaurians could gather against him. Deiphontes and his children—for
before this children had been born to him, Antimenes, Xanthippos, and
Argeus, and a daughter, Orsobia, who, they say, afterwards married
Pamphylos, son of Aigimios—took up the dead body of Hyrnetho and carried
it to this place, which in course of time was named Hyrnethium.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.28.7">

They built for her a hero-shrine, and bestowed upon her various honors;
in particular, the custom was established that nobody should carry home,
or use for any purpose, the pieces that break off the olive trees, or
any other trees, that grow there; these are left there on the spot to be
sacred to Hyrnetho.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.28.8">

Not far from the city is the tomb of Melissa, who married Periandros,
the son of Kypselos, and another of Prokles, the father of Melissa. He,
too, was tyrant of Epidaurus, as Periandros, his son-in-law, was tyrant
of Corinth.[^188]

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.1">

The most noteworthy things which I found the city of Epidaurus itself
had to show are these. There is, of course, a precinct of Asklepios,
with statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\]
of the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]
himself and of Epione. Epione, they say, was the wife of Asklepios.
These are of Parian marble, and are set up in the open. There is also in
the city a temple of Dionysus and one of Artemis. The figure of Artemis
one might take to be the goddess hunting. There is also a sanctuary of
Aphrodite, while the one at the harbor, on a height that juts out into
the sea, they say is Hērā’s. The Athena on the citadel, a wooden image
worth seeing, they surname Cissaea (Ivy Goddess).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.2">

The Aeginetans dwell in the island that is situated opposite the
mainland of Epidauros. It is said that in the beginning there were no
humans in it; but after Zeus brought to it, when uninhabited, Aegina,
daughter of Asopos, its name was changed from Oinone to Aegina; and when
Aiakos, on growing up, asked Zeus for settlers, the god, they say,
raised up the inhabitants out of the earth. They can mention no king of
the island except Aiakos, since we know of none even of the sons of
Aiakos who stayed there; for to Peleus and Telamon befell exile for the
murder of Phokos, while the sons of Phokos made their home about
Parnassus, in the land that is now called Phokis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.3">

This name had already been given to the land, at the time when Phokos,
son of Ornytion, came to it a generation previously. In the time, then,
of this Phokos only the district about Tithorea and Parnassus was called
Phokis, but in the time of Aiakos the name spread to all from the
borders of the Minyaiat Orkhomenos to Skarphea among the people of
Lokris \[= Lokroi\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.4">

From Peleus sprang the kings in Epeiros; but as for the sons of Telamon,
the lineage of Ajax is undistinguished, because he was a man who lived a
private life; though Miltiades, who led the Athenians to Marathon,[^189]
and Kimon, the son of Miltiades, achieved renown; but the lineage of
Teukros continued to be the royal house in Cyprus down to the time of
Euagoras. Asios the epic poet says that to Phokos were born Panopeus and
Crisus. To Panopeus was born Epeios, who made, according to Homer, the
wooden horse; and the grandson of Crisus was Pylades, whose father was
Strophios, son of Crisus, while his mother was Anaxibia, sister of
Agamemnon. Such was the pedigree of the Aiakidai (lineage of Aiakos), as
they are called, but they departed from the beginning to other lands.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.5">

Subsequently a division of the Argives who, under Deiphontes, had seized
Epidaurus, crossed to Aegina, and, settling among the old Aeginetans,
established in the island Dorian manners and the Dorian dialect.
Although the Aeginetans rose to great power, so that their navy was
superior to that of Athens, and in the Persian war supplied more ships
than any state except Athens, yet their prosperity was not permanent but
when the island was depopulated by the Athenians,[^190] they took up
their abode at Thyrea, in Argolis, which the Lacedaemonians gave them to
dwell in. They recovered their island when the Athenian warships were
captured in the Hellespont,[^191] yet it was never given them to rise
again to their old wealth or power.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.6">

Of the Greek islands, Aegina is the most difficult of access, for it is
surrounded by sunken rocks and reefs which rise up. The story is that
Aiakos devised this feature of set purpose, because he feared piratical
raids by sea, and wished the approach to be perilous to enemies. Near
the harbor in which vessels mostly anchor is a temple of Aphrodite, and
in the most conspicuous part of the city what is called the shrine of
Aiakos, a quadrangular enclosure of white marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.7">

Made-in-relief at the entrance are the envoys whom the Greeks once
dispatched to Aiakos. The reason for the embassy given by the Aeginetans
is the same as that which the other Greeks assign. A drought had for
some time afflicted Greece, and no rain fell either beyond the Isthmus
or in the Peloponnesus, until at last they sent envoys to Delphi to ask
what was the cause and to beg for deliverance from the evil. The Pythian
priestess ordered them to propitiate Zeus, saying that he would not
listen to them unless the one to supplicate him were Aiakos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.8">

And so envoys came with a request to Aiakos from each city. By sacrifice
and prayer to Zeus Panhēllenios \[‘the one who belongs to all
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hellēnes’</span>\], he caused
rain to fall upon the earth, and the Aeginetans made these likenesses of
those who came to him. Within the enclosure are olive trees that have
grown there from of old, and there is an altar which is raised but a
little from the ground. That this altar is also the tomb of Aiakos is
told as a holy secret.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.9">

Beside the shrine of Aiakos is the tomb of Phokos, a barrow surrounded
by a basement, and on it lies a rough stone. When Telamon and Peleus had
induced Phokos to compete at the pentathlon, and it was now the turn of
Peleus to hurl the stone, which they were using for a discus, he
intentionally hit Phokos. The act was done to please their mother; for,
while they were both born of the daughter of Skiron, Phokos was not,
being, if indeed the report of the Greeks be true, the son of a sister
of Thetis. I believe it was for this reason, and not only out of
friendship for Orestes, that Pylades plotted the murder of Neoptolemos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.10">

When this blow of the discus killed Phokos, the sons of Endeis boarded a
ship and fled. Afterwards Telamon sent a herald denying that he had
plotted the death of Phokos. Aiakos, however, refused to allow him to
land on the island, and bade him to make his defense standing on board
ship, or if he wished, from a mole raised in the sea. So he sailed into
the harbor called Secret, and proceeded to make a mole by night. This
was finished, and still remains at the present day. But Telamon, being
condemned as implicated in the murder of Phokos, sailed away a second
time and came to Salamis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.29.11">

Not far from the Secret Harbor is a theater worth seeing; it is very
similar to the one at Epidaurus, both in size and in style. Behind it is
built one side of a race-course, which not only itself holds up the
theater, but also in turn uses it as a support.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.1">

There are three temples close together, one of Apollo, one of Artemis,
and a third of Dionysus. Apollo has a naked wooden image of native
workmanship, but Artemis is dressed, and so, too, is Dionysus, who is,
moreover, represented with a beard. The sanctuary of Asklepios is not
here, but in another place, and his statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is of stone,
and seated.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.2">

Of the gods, the Aeginetans worship most Hekate, in whose honor every
year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thracian
established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its
wooden-statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\]
is the work of Myron,[^192] and it has one face and one body. It was
Alkamenes,[^193] in my opinion, who first made three statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Hekate
attached to one another, a figure called by the Athenians Epipurgidia
(on the Tower); it stands beside the temple of the Wingless Nike.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.3">

In Aegina, as you go towards the mountain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oros</span>\] of Zeus, god of
all the Hellenes, you reach a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Aphaia, in
whose honor Pindar composed an ode for the Aeginetans. The Cretans say
(the story of Aphaia is Cretan) that Carmanor, who purified Apollo alter
he had killed Pythō, was the father of Euboulos, and that the daughter
of Zeus and of Carme, the daughter of Euboulos, was Britomartis. She
took delight, they say, in running and in the chase, and was very dear
to Artemis. Fleeing from Minos, who had fallen in love with her, she
threw herself into nets which had been cast
(<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aphemena</span>) for a draught
of fishes. She was made a goddess by Artemis, and she is worshipped, not
only by the Cretans, but also by the Aeginetans, who say that
Britomartis shows herself in their island. Her surname among the
Aeginetans is Aphaia; in Crete it is Dictynna (Goddess of Nets).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.4">

The Mountain \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oros</span>\] of
all the Hellenes, except for the sanctuary of Zeus, has, I found,
nothing else worthy of mention. This sanctuary, they say, was made for
Zeus by Aiakos. The story of Auxesia and Damia, how the Epidaurians
suffered from drought, how in obedience to an oracle they had these
wooden-statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoana</span>\]images made of
olive wood that they received from the Athenians, how the Epidaurians
left off paying to the Athenians what they had agreed to pay, on the
ground that the Aeginetans had the statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\], how the
Athenians perished who crossed over to Aegina to fetch them—all this, as
Herodotus has described it accurately and in detail, I have no intention
of relating, because the story has been well told already; but I will
add that I saw the statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\], and
sacrificed to them in the same way as it is customary to sacrifice at
Eleusis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.5">

So much I must relate about Aegina, for the sake of Aiakos and his
exploits. Bordering on Epidauria are the Troizenians, unrivalled
glorifiers of their own country. They say that Orus was the first to be
born in their land. Now, in my opinion, Orus is an Egyptian name and
utterly foreign; but they assert that he became their king, and that the
land was called Oraea after him and that Althepus, the son of Poseidon
and of Leis, the daughter of Orus, inheriting the kingdom after Orus,
named the land Althepia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.6">

During his reign, they say, Athena and Poseidon disputed about the land,
and after disputing held it in common, as Zeus commanded them to do. For
this reason they worship both Athena, whom they name both
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Poliás</span> \[‘of the Polis’\]
and <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Stheniás</span> \[‘of
strength’\], and also Poseidon, whose name-of-invocation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\] is Basileus
\[‘king’\]. And moreover their old coins have as device a trident and a
face of Athena.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.7">

After Althepus, Saron became king. They said that this man built the
sanctuary for Saronian Artemis by a sea which is marshy and shallow, so
that for this reason it was called the Phoebaean lagoon. Now Saron was
very fond of hunting. As he was chasing a doe, it so chanced that it
dashed into the sea and he dashed in alter it. The doe swam further and
further from the shore, and Saron kept close to his prey, until his
ardor brought him to the open ocean. Here his strength failed, and he
was drowned in the waves. The body was cast ashore at the grove of
Artemis by the Phoebaean lagoon, and they buried it within the sacred
enclosure, and after him they named the sea in these parts the Saronic
instead of the Phoebaean lagoon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.8">

They know nothing of the later kings down to Hyperes and Anthas. These
they assert to be sons of Poseidon and of Alcyone, daughter of Atlas,
adding that they founded in the country the cities of Hyperea and
Anthea; Aitios, however, the son of Anthas, on inheriting the kingdoms
of his father and of his uncle, named one of the cities Poseidonias.
When Troizen and Pittheus came to Aitios there were three kings instead
of one, but the sons of Pelops enjoyed the balance of power.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.9">

Here is evidence of it. When Troizen died, Pittheus gathered the
inhabitants together, incorporating both Hyperea and Anthea into the
modern city, which he named Troizen after his brother. Many years
afterwards the descendants of Aitios, son of Anthas, were dispatched as
colonists from Troizen, and founded Halicarnassus and Myndus in Caria.
Anaphlystos and Sphettos, sons of Troizen, migrated to Attica, and the
demes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmoi</span>\] are named
after them. As my readers know it already, I shall not relate the story
of Theseus, the grandson of Pittheus. There is, however, one incident
that I must add.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.30.10">

On the return of the Herakleidai, the Troizenians too received Dorian
settlers from Argos. They had been subject at even an earlier date to
the Argives; Homer, too, in the Catalogue, says that their commander was
Diomedes. For Diomedes and Euryalus, son of Mecisteus, who were
guardians of the boy Kyanippos, son of Aigialeus, led the Argives to
Troy. Sthenelus, as I have related above, came of a more illustrious
family, called the Anaxagoridai, and he had the best claim to the
Kingdom of Argos. Such is the story of the Troizenians, with the
exception of the cities that claim to be their colonies. I will now
proceed to describe the appointments of their sanctuaries and the
remarkable sights of their country.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.1">

In the marketplace of Troizen is a temple of Artemis Savior
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Sōteira</span>\], with statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of the
goddess. It was said that the temple was founded and the name Savior
given by Theseus when he returned from Crete after overcoming Asterion
the son of Minos. This victory he considered the most noteworthy of his
achievements, not so much, in my opinion, because Asterion was the
bravest of those killed by Theseus, but because his success in
unraveling the difficult Maze and in escaping unnoticed after the
exploit made credible the saying that it was divine providence that
brought Theseus and his company back in safety.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.2">

In this temple are altars to the gods said to rule under the earth. It
is here that they say Semele was brought out of Hades by Dionysus, and
that Hēraklēs dragged up the Hound of Hades.[^194] But I cannot bring
myself to believe even that Semele died at all, seeing that she was the
wife of Zeus; while, as for the so-called Hound of Hades, I will give my
views in another place.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.3">

Behind the temple is the tomb of Pittheus, on which are placed three
seats of white marble. On them they say that Pittheus and two men with
him used to sit in judgment. Not far off is a sanctuary of the Muses,
made, they told me, by Ardalus, son of Hephaistos. This Ardalus they
hold to have invented the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\],
and after him they name the Muses Ardalides. Here, they say, Pittheus
taught the art of rhetoric, and I have myself read a book purporting to
be a treatise by Pittheus, published by a citizen of Epidaurus. Not far
from the Muses’ Hall is an old altar, which also, according to report,
was dedicated by Ardalus. Upon it they sacrifice to the Muses and to
Sleep, saying that Sleep is the god that is dearest to the Muses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.4">

Near the theater a temple of Artemis Lykaia was made by Hippolytus.
About this surname \[Lykaia\] I could learn nothing from the local
guides, but I gathered that either Hippolytus destroyed wolves
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lukoi</span>\] that were
ravaging the land of Troizen, or else that Lykaia is a surname of
Artemis among the Amazons, from whom he \[=Hippolytus\] was descended
through his mother. Perhaps there may be another explanation that I am
unaware of. The stone in front of the temple, called the Sacred Stone,
they say is that on which nine men of Troizen once purified Orestes from
the stain of matricide.

Not far from Artemis Lykaia are altars close to one another. The first
of them is to Dionysus, surnamed, in accordance with an oracle, Saotes
(Savior); the second is named the altar of the Themides (Laws), and was
dedicated, they say, by Pittheus. They had every reason, it seems to me,
for making an altar to Hēlios Eleutherios (Sun, God of Freedom), seeing
that they escaped being enslaved by Xerxes and the Persians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.6">

The sanctuary of Thearian Apollo, they told me, was set up by Pittheus;
it is the oldest I know of. Now the people of Phokaia, too, in Ionia
have an old temple of Athena, which was once burned by Harpagus the
Persian, and the Samians also have an old one of Pythian Apollo; these,
however, were built much later than the sanctuary at Troizen. The modern
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] was
dedicated by Auliskos, and made by Hermon of Troizen. This Hermon made
also the wooden images of the Dioskouroi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.7">

Under a portico in the marketplace are set up women; both they and their
children are of stone. They are the women and children whom the
Athenians gave to the Troizenians to be kept safe, when they had
resolved to evacuate Athens and not to await the attack of the Persians
by land. They are said to have dedicated likenesses, not of all the
women—for, as a matter of fact, the statues are not many—but only of
those who were of high rank.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.8">

In front of the sanctuary of Apollo is a building called the Booth of
Orestes. For before he was purified for shedding his mother’s blood, no
citizen of Troizen would receive him into his home; so they lodged him
here and gave him entertainment while they purified him, until they had
finished the purification. Down to the present day the descendants of
those who purified Orestes dine here on appointed days. A little way
from the booth were buried, they say, the means of purifying, and from
them grew up a bay tree, which, indeed, still remains, being the one
before this booth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.9">

Among the means of purifying which they say they used to purify Orestes
was water from Hippocrene (Horse’s Fount) for the Troizenians too have a
fountain called the Horse’s, and what they say is a variant of what they
say in Boeotia. For they, too, say that the earth sent up the water when
the horse Pegasus \[Pegasos\] struck the ground with his hoof, and that
Bellerophontes came to Troizen to ask Pittheus to give him Aithra as
wife, but before the marriage took place he was banished from Corinth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.31.10">

Here there is also a Hermes called Polygius. Against this statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], they say,
Hēraklēs leaned his club. Now this club, which was of wild olive, taking
root in the earth (if anyone cares to believe the story), grew up again
and is still alive; Hēraklēs, they say, discovering the wild olive by
the Saronic Sea, cut a club from it. There is also a sanctuary of Zeus
surnamed Savior, which, they say, was made by Aitios, the son of Anthas,
when he was king. To a water they give the name River of Gold. They say
that when the land was afflicted with a drought for nine years, during
which no rain fell, all the other waters dried up, but this River of
Gold even then continued to flow as before.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.1">

To Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, is dedicated a very famous precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\], in which is
a temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] with an
ancient \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhaion</span>\]
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\].
Diomedes, they say, made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] these, and,
further, he was the first to sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] to Hippolytus.
The people of Troizen have a priest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereus</span>\] of
Hippolytus, and he is consecrated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierâsthai</span>\] \[to
Hippolytus\] for life. Also, it is an established practice for them to
have annual sacrifices
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiai</span>\] performed
\[for Hippolytus\]. In addition \[to this ritual practice performed for
Hippolytus\] they have another one. They perform-a-ritual
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\] that is as
follows. Every girl before marriage cuts off for him \[= Hippolytus\] a
lock \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">plokamos</span>\] of her
hair and, having cut it off, she brings it, in an act of
bringing-in-procession
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pherein</span>\], to his
temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] and
dedicates it. They \[= the people of Troizen\] are unwilling to accept
that he died, dragged to death by his horses, and they do not show
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apophainein</span>\] his tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\], though they
know where it is. But they customarily-think
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] that the one
who is called the Charioteer \[= Auriga =
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēniokhos</span>\] in the sky,
this one \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">houtos</span>\], is
that one \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ekeinos</span>\], the
Hippolytus who receives this honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\] from the gods.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.2">

Within this enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\][^195] \[of
Hippolytus\] is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Apollo
Epibatērios \[‘boarding (the ship)’\], a dedication of Diomedes for
having weathered the storm that came upon the Greeks as they were
returning from Troy. They say that Diomedes was also the first to hold
the Pythian Contest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōn</span>\] in honor of
Apollo. Of Damia and Auxesia (for the people of Troizen, too, share in
their worship) they do not tell
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legein</span>\] the same story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] as do the
people of Epidauros and of Aegina, but they say that they were maidens
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénoi</span>\] who came
from Crete. When factionalism
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stasis</span>\] broke out
everywhere in the city, even these girls, they say, were stoned to death
by an opposing faction and they \[= the people of Troizen\] celebrate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] a festival
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] for their
sake, calling it the Lithobolia \[‘throwing of stones’\]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.3">

In the other part of the enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\][^196] is a
racecourse \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stadion</span>\]
named after Hippolytus, and looming over it is a shrine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Aphrodite
\[invoked by way of the epithet\]
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kataskopiā</span> \[‘looking
down from the heights\]. Here is the reason \[for the epithet\]: it was
at this very spot, whenever Hippolytus was exercising-naked
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gumnazesthai</span>\], that
she, Phaedra, feeling-an-erotic-passion-for
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erân</span>\] him,
used-to-gaze-away
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-blepein</span>\] at him
from above. A myrtle-bush
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mursinē</span>\] still grows
here, and its leaves—as I wrote at an earlier point­ \[= 1.22.2\]—have
holes pricked into them.[^197] Whenever Phaedra
was-feeling-there-was-no-way-out
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aporeîn</span>\] and could
find no relief for her erotic-passion
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\], she would take
it out on the leaves of this myrtle-bush, wantonly injuring them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.4">

There is also a
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Phaedra,
not far from the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Hippolytus,
and it \[= the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] is
heaped-up-as-a-tumulus
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kekhōstai</span>\] near the
myrtle-bush \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mursinē</span>\].
The statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Asklepios was made by Timotheus, but the people of Troizen say that it
is not Asklepios, but a likeness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikōn</span>\] of Hippolytus.
Also, when I saw the House
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikiā</span>\] of Hippolytus,
I knew that it was his abode.[^198] In front of it is situated what they
call the Fountain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krēnē</span>\] of Hēraklēs,
since Hēraklēs, as the people of Troizen say, discovered the water.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.5">

On the citadel is a temple of Athena, called Sthenias. The wooden-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] itself of the
goddess was made by Kallon, of Aegina.[^199] Kallon was a pupil of
Tectaeus and Angelion, who made the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Apollo for
the Delians. Angelion and Tectaeus were trained in the school of
Dipoinos and Skyllis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.6">

On going down from here you come to a sanctuary of Pan Lyterios
(Releasing), so named because he showed to the Troizenian magistrates
dreams which supplied a cure for the epidemic that had afflicted
Troizenia, and the Athenians more than any other people. Having crossed
the sanctuary, you can see a temple of Isis, and above it one of
Aphrodite of the Height. The temple of Isis was made by the
Halicarnassians in Troizen, because this is their mother-city, but the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Isis
was dedicated by the people of Troizen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.7">

On the road that leads through the mountains to Hermione is a spring of
the river Hyllicus, originally called Taurios (Bull-like), and a rock
called the Rock of Theseus; when Theseus took up the boots and sword of
Aigeus under it, it, too, changed its name, for before it was called the
altar of Zeus Sthenios (Strong). Near the rock is a sanctuary of
Aphrodite Nymphia (Bridal), made by Theseus when he took Helen to wife.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.8">

Outside the wall there is also a sanctuary of Poseidon Nurturer
(Phytalmios). For they say that, being angry with them, Poseidon smote
the land with barrenness, brine (halme) reaching the seeds and the roots
of the plants
(<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phuta</span>),[^200] until,
appeased by sacrifices and prayers, he ceased to send up the brine upon
the earth. Above the temple of Poseidon is Demeter Lawbringer
(Thesmophoros), set up, they say, by Althepus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.9">

On going down to the harbor at what is called Celenderis, you come to a
place called Birthplace (Genethlion), where Theseus is said to have been
born. Before this place is a temple of Ares, for here also did Theseus
conquer the Amazons in battle. These must have belonged to the army that
strove in Attica against Theseus and the Athenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.32.10">

As you make your way to the Psiphaean Sea you see a wild olive growing,
which they call the Bent Rhakos. The people of Troizen call
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">rhakos</span> every kind of
barren olive
tree—<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kotinos</span>,
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phylia</span>, or
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">elaious</span>—and this tree
they call Bent because it was when the reins caught in it that the
chariot of Hippolytus was upset. Not far from this stands the sanctuary
of Saronian Artemis, and I have already given an account of it. I must
add that every year they hold in honor of Artemis a festival called
Saronia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.33.1">

The people of Troizen possess islands, one of which is near the
mainland, and it is possible to wade across the channel. This was
formerly called Sphairia, but its name was changed to Sacred Island for
the following reason. In it is the tomb of Sphairos, who, they say, was
charioteer to Pelops. In obedience forsooth to a dream from Athena,
Aithra crossed over into the island with libations for Sphairos. After
she had crossed, Poseidon is said to have had intercourse with her here.
So, for this reason, Aithra set up here a temple of Athena
Apaturia,[^201] and changed the name from Sphairia to Sacred Island. She
also established a custom for the girls of Troizen: to dedicate their
waistbands, before marriage, to Athena Apaturia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.33.2">

Kalaureia, they say, was sacred to Apollo of old, at the time when
Delphi was sacred to Poseidon. It is also said that the two gods
exchanged the two places. They still say this, and quote an oracle:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Delos and Kalaureia alike you love to dwell in,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Pythō, too, the holy, and Taenarum swept by the high winds.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.33.3">

Within the enclosure is also the tomb of Demosthenes. His fate, and that
of Homer before him, have, in my opinion, showed most plainly how
spiteful the deity is; for Homer, after losing his sight, was, in
addition to this great affliction, cursed with a second—a poverty which
drove him in beggary to every land; while to Demosthenes it befell to
experience exile in his old age and to meet with such a violent end.
Now, although concerning him, not only others, but Demosthenes himself,
have again and again declared that assuredly he took no part of the
money that Harpalos brought from Asia,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.33.4">

yet I must relate the circumstances of the statement made subsequently.
Shortly after Harpalos ran away from Athens and crossed with a squadron
to Crete, he was put to death by the servants who were attending him,
though some assert that he was assassinated by Pausanias, a Macedonian.
The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a
Macedonian, Philoxenos, who also had demanded Harpalos from the
Athenians. Having this slave in his power, he proceeded to examine him,
until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to
accept a bribe from Harpalos. On obtaining this information he sent a
dispatch to Athens,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.33.5">

in which he gave a list of such as had taken a bribe from Harpalos, both
their names and the sums each had received. Demosthenes, however, he
never mentioned at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred,
and he himself had a private quarrel with him. So Demosthenes is honored
in many parts of Greece, and especially by the dwellers in Kalaureia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.1">

Stretching out far into the sea from Troizenia is a peninsula, on the
coast of which has been founded a little town called Methana. Here there
is a sanctuary of Isis, and on the marketplace is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Hermes, and
also one of Hēraklēs. Some thirty stadium-lengths distant from the town
are hot baths. They say that it was when Antigonos, son of Demetrios,
was king of Macedon that the water first appeared, and that what
appeared at once was not water, but fire that gushed in great volume
from the ground, and when this died down the water flowed; indeed, even
at the present day it wells up hot and exceedingly salt. A bather here
finds no cold water at hand, and if he dives into the sea his swim is
full of danger. For wild creatures live in it, and it swarms with
sharks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.2">

I will also relate what astonished me most in Methana. The wind called
Lips, striking the budding vines from the Saronic Gulf, blights their
buds. So while the wind is still rushing on, two men cut in two a
rooster whose feathers are all white, and run round the vines in
opposite directions, each carrying half of the rooster. When they meet
at their starting place, they bury the pieces there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.3">

Such are the means they have devised against the Lips. The islets, nine
in number, lying off the land are called the Isles of Pelops, and they
say that when it rains one of them is not touched. If this be the case I
do not know, though the people around Methana said that it was true, and
I have seen before now men trying to keep off hail by sacrifices and
spells.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.4">

Methana, then, is a peninsula of the Peloponnesus. Within it, bordering
on the land of Troizen, is Hermione. The founder of the old city, the
Hermionians say, was Hermion, the son of Europs. Now Europs, whose
father was certainly Phoroneus, Herophanes of Troizen said was an
illegitimate child. For surely the kingdom of Argos would never have
devolved upon Argos, Niobe’s son, the grandchild of Phoroneus, in the
presence of a legitimate son.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.5">

But even supposing that Europs was a legitimate child who died before
Phoroneus, I am quite sure that his son was not likely to stand a fair
chance against Niobe’s child, whose father was supposed to be Zeus.
Subsequently the Dorians from Argos settled, among other places, at
Hermion, but I do not think there was war between the two peoples, or it
would have been spoken of by the Argives.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.6">

There is a road from Troizen to Hermion by way of the rock which
aforetime was called the altar of Zeus Sthenios (Strong) but afterwards
Theseus took up the tokens, and people now call it the Rock of Theseus.
As you go, then, along a mountain road by way of this rock, you reach a
temple of Apollo surnamed Platanistios (God of the Plane tree Grove),
and a place called Eilei, where are sanctuaries of Demeter and of her
daughter Kore (Maiden). Seawards, on the borders of Hermionis, is a
sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Thermasia (Warmth).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.7">

Just about eighty stadium-lengths away is a headland Scyllaeum, which is
named alter the daughter of Nisos. For when, owing to her treachery,
Minos had taken Nisaia and Megara, he said that now he would not have
her to wife, and ordered his Cretans to throw her from the ship. She was
drowned, and the waves cast up her body on this headland. They do not
show a tomb of her, but say that the sea birds were allowed to tear the
corpse to pieces.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.8">

As you sail from Scyllaeum in the direction of the city, you reach
another headland, called Bucephala (Ox-head), and, after the headland,
islands, the first of which is Haliussa (Salt Island). This provides a
harbor where there is good anchorage. After it comes Pityussa (Pine
Island), and the third they call Aristerae. On sailing past these you
come to another headland, Colyergia, jutting out from the mainland, and
after it to an island, called Trikrana (Three Heads), and a mountain,
projecting into the sea from the Peloponnesus, called Buporthmus
(Oxford). On Buporthmus has been built a sanctuary of Demeter and her
daughter, as well as one of Athena, surnamed Promakhorma (Champion of
the Anchorage).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.9">

Before Buporthmus lies an island called Aperopia, not far from which is
another island, Hydrea. After it the mainland is skirted by a
crescent-shaped beach and after the beach there is a spit of land up to
a sanctuary of Poseidon, beginning at the sea on the east and extending
westwards. It possesses harbors, and is some seven stadium-lengths long,
and not more than three stadium-lengths in breadth where it is broadest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.10">

Here the Hermionians had their former city. They still have sanctuaries
here: one of Poseidon at the east end of the spit, and a temple of
Athena further inland by the side of the latter are the foundations of a
race-course, at which they say the sons of Tyndareus contended. There is
also another sanctuary of Athena, of no great size, the roof of which
has fallen in. There is a temple to Hēlios \[Sun\], another to the
Graces, and a third to Serapis and Isis. There are also circuits of
large unhewn stones, within which they perform mystic ritual to Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.11">

Such are the possessions of the Hermionians in these parts. The modern
city is just about four stadium-lengths distant from the headland, upon
which is the sanctuary of Poseidon, and it lies on a site which is level
at first, gently rising up a slope, which presently merges into Prone,
for so they name this mountain. A wall stands all round Hermione, a city
which I found afforded much to write about, and among the things which I
thought I myself must certainly mention are a temple of Aphrodite,
surnamed both Pontia (of the Deep Sea) and Limenia (of the Harbor), and
a white-marble statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of huge size,
and worth seeing for its artistic excellence.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.34.12">

There is also another temple of Aphrodite. Among the honors paid her by
the Hermionians is this custom: girls, and widows about to remarry, all
sacrifice to her before wedding. Sanctuaries have also been built of
Demeter Thermasia (Warmth), one at the border towards Troizenia, as I
have stated above, while there is another in Hermione itself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.1">

Near the latter is a temple of Dionysus of the Black Goatskin. In his
honor every year they hold a competition in music, and they offer prizes
for swimming-races and boat-races. There is also a sanctuary of Artemis
surnamed Iphigeneia, and a bronze Poseidon with one foot upon a dolphin.
Passing by this into the sanctuary of Hestia, we see no statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], but only an
altar, and they sacrifice to Hestia upon it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.2">

Of Apollo there are three temples and three statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\]. One has no
surname; the second they call Pythaeus, and the third Horios (of the
Borders). The name Pythaeus they have learned from the Argives, for
Telesilla tells us that they were the first Greeks to whose country came
Pythaeus, who was a son of Apollo. I cannot say for certain why they
call the third Horios, but I conjecture that they won a victory, either
in war or by arbitration, in a dispute concerning the borders (horoi) of
their land, and for this reason paid honors to Apollo Horios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.3">

The sanctuary of Fortune is said by the Hermionians to be the newest in
their city; a colossus of Parian marble stands there. Of their wells,
one is very old; nobody can see the water flowing into it, but it would
never run dry, even if everybody descended and drew water from it.
Another well they made in our own day, and the name of the place from
which the water flows into it is Leimon (Meadow).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.4">

The object most worthy of mention is a sanctuary of Demeter on Pron.
This sanctuary is said by the Hermionians to have been founded by
Klymenos, son of Phoroneus, and Khthonia, sister of Klymenos. But the
Argive account is that when Demeter came to Argolis, while Atheras and
Mysios afforded hospitality to the goddess, Colontas neither received
her into his home nor paid her any other mark of respect. His daughter
Khthonia disapproved of this conduct. They say that Colontas was
punished by being burned up along with his house, while Khthonia was
brought to Hermion by Demeter, and made the sanctuary for the
Hermionians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.5">

At any rate, the goddess herself is called Khthonia, and Khthonia is the
name of the festival they hold in the summer of every year. The manner
of it is this. The procession is headed by the priests of the gods and
by all those who hold the annual magistracies; these are followed by
both men and women. It is now a custom that some who are still children
should honor the goddess in the procession. These are dressed in white,
and wear wreaths upon their heads. Their wreaths are woven of the flower
called by the natives kosmosandalon, which, from its size and color,
seems to me to be an iris; it even has inscribed upon it the same
letters of mourning.[^202]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.6">

Those who form the procession are followed by men leading from the herd
a full-grown cow, fastened with ropes, and still untamed and frisky.
Having driven the cow to the temple, some loose her from the ropes that
she may rush into the sanctuary, others, who hitherto have been holding
the doors open, when they see the cow within the temple, close the
doors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.7">

Four old women, left behind inside, are they who dispatch the cow.
Whichever gets the chance cuts the throat of the cow with a sickle.
Afterwards the doors are opened, and those who are appointed drive up a
second cow, and a third after that, and yet a fourth. All are dispatched
in the same way by the old women, and the sacrifice has yet another
strange feature. On whichever of her sides the first cow falls, all the
others must fall on the same.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.8">

Such is the manner in which the sacrifice is performed by the
Hermionians. Before the temple stand a few statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikónes</span>\] of the women
who have served Demeter as her priestess, and on passing inside you see
seats on which the old women wait for the cows to be driven in one by
one, and statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\], of no great
age, of Athena and Demeter. But the thing itself that they worship more
than all else, I never saw, nor yet has any other man, whether stranger
or Hermionian. The old women may keep their knowledge of its nature to
themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.9">

There is also another temple, all round which stand statues. This temple
is right opposite that of Khthonia, and is called that of Klymenos, and
they sacrifice to Klymenos here. I do not believe that Klymenos was an
Argive who came to Hermion. ‘Klymenos’ is the surname of the god,
whoever the story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] says is king in
the underworld.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.10">

Beside this temple is another; it is of Ares, and has a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of the god,
while to the right of the sanctuary of Khthonia is a portico, called by
the natives the Portico of Echo. It is such that if a man speaks it
reverberates at least three times. Behind the temple of Khthonia are
three places which the Hermionians call that of Klymenos, that of Pluto
\[Ploutōn\], and the Acherusian Lake. All are surrounded by fences of
stones, while in the place of Klymenos there is also a chasm in the
earth. Through this, according to what-is-said
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legomena</span>\] by the
Hermionians, Hēraklēs brought up the Hound of Hades.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.35.11">

At the gate through which there is a straight road leading to Mases,
there is a sanctuary of Eileithuia within the wall. Every day, both with
sacrifices and with incense, they magnificently propitiate the goddess,
and, moreover, there is a vast number of votive gifts offered to
Eileithuia. But the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] no one may
see, except, perhaps, the priestesses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.1">

Proceeding about seven stadium-lengths along the straight road to Mases,
you reach, on turning to the left, a road to Halice. At the present day
Halice is deserted, but once it, too, had inhabitants, and there is
mention made of citizens of Halice on the Epidaurian slabs on which are
inscribed the cures of Asklepios. I know, however, no other authentic
document in which mention is made either of the city Halice or of its
citizens. Well, to this city also there is a road, which lies midway
between Pron and another mountain, called in old days Thornax; but they
say that the name was changed because, according to what they say, it
was here that the transformation of Zeus into a cuckoo took place.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.2">

Even to the present day there are sanctuaries on the tops of the
mountains: on Mount Cuckoo one of Zeus, on Pron one of Hērā. At the foot
of Mount Cuckoo is a temple, but there are no doors standing, and I
found it without a roof or a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] inside. The
temple was said to be Apollo’s. by the side of it runs a road to Mases
for those who have turned aside from the straight road. Mases was in old
days a city, even as Homer[^203] represents it in the catalogue of the
Argives, but in my time the Hermionians were using it as a seaport.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.3">

From Mases there is a road on the right to a headland called Strouthos
(Sparrow Peak). From this headland by way of the summits of the
mountains the distance to the place called Philanorium and to the Boleoi
is two hundred and fifty stadium-lengths. These Boleoi are heaps of
unhewn stones. Another place, called Twins, is twenty stadium-lengths
distant from here. There is here a sanctuary of Apollo, a sanctuary of
Poseidon, and in addition one of Demeter. The statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] are of white
marble, and are upright.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.4">

Next comes a district, belonging to the Argives, that once was called
Asinaia, and by the sea are ruins of Asine. When the Lacedaemonians and
their king Nikandros, son of Kharillos, son of Polydektes, son of
Eunomos, son of Prytanis, son of Eurypon, invaded Argolis with an army,
the Asinaeans joined in the invasion, and with them ravaged the land of
the Argives. When the Lacedaemonian expedition departed home, the
Argives under their king Eratos attacked Asine.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.5">

For a time the Asinaeans defended themselves from their wall, and killed
among others Lysistratos, one of the most notable men of Argos. But when
the wall was lost, the citizens put their wives and children on board
their vessels and abandoned their own country; the Argives, while
leveling Asine to the ground and annexing its territory to their own,
left the sanctuary of Apollo Pythaeus, which is still visible, and by it
they buried Lysistratos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.6">

Distant from Argos forty stadium-lengths and no more is the sea at
Lerna. On the way down to Lerna the first thing on the road is the
Erasinos, which empties itself into the Phrixos, and the Phrixos into
the sea between Temenium and Lerna. About eight stadium-lengths to the
left from the Erasinos is a sanctuary of the Lords Dioskouroi (Sons of
Zeus). Their wooden images have been made similar to those in the city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.7">

On returning to the straight road, you will cross the Erasinos and reach
the river Kheimarros (Winter-torrent). Near it is a circuit of stones,
and they say that Pluto \[Ploutōn\], after carrying off, according to
the story, Kore, the daughter of Demeter, descended here to his fabled
kingdom underground. Lerna is, I have already stated, by the sea, and
here they celebrate mysteries in honor of Lernaean Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.36.8">

There is a sacred grove beginning on the mountain they call Pontinos.
Now Mount Pontinos does not let the rainwater flow away, but absorbs it
into itself. From it flows a river, also called Pontinos. Upon the top
of the mountain is a sanctuary of Athena Saitis, now merely a ruin;
there are also the foundations of a house of Hippomedon, who went to
Thebes to redress the wrongs of Polyneikes, son of Oedipus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.37.1">

At this mountain begins the grove, which consists chiefly of plane
trees, and reaches down to the sea. Its boundaries are, on the one side
the river Pantinos, on the other side another river, called Amymane,
after the daughter of Danaos. Within the tomb are statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Demeter
Prosymne and of Dionysus. Of Demeter there is a seated statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of no great
size.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.37.2">

Both are of stone, but in another temple is a seated wooden-statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xoanon</span>\] of Dionysus
Saotes (Savior), while by the sea is a stone statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Aphrodite.
They say that the daughters of Danaos dedicated it, while Danaos himself
made the sanctuary of Athena by the Pontinos. The mysteries of the
Lernaeans were established, they say, by Philammon. Now the words which
accompany the ritual are evidently of no antiquity

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.37.3">

and the inscription also, which I have heard is written on the heart
made of orichalcum, was shown not to be Philammon’s by Arriphon, an
Aetolian of Triconium by descent, who now enjoys a reputation second to
none among the Lycians; excellent at original research, he found the
clue to this problem in the following way: the verses, and the prose
interspersed among the verses, are all written in Doric. But before the
return of the Herakleidai to the Peloponnesus the Argives spoke the same
dialect as the Athenians, and in Philammon’s day I do not suppose that
even the name Dorians was familiar to all Greek ears.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.37.4">

All this was proved in the demonstration. At the source of the Amymone
grows a plane tree, beneath which, they say, the hydra (water-snake)
grew. I am ready to believe that this beast was superior in size to
other water-snakes, and that its poison had something in it so deadly
that Hēraklēs treated the points of his arrows with its gall. It had,
however, in my opinion, one head, and not several. It was
Peisandros[^204] of Camirus who, in order that the beast might appear
more frightful and his poetry might be more remarkable, represented the
hydra with its many heads.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.37.5">

I saw also what is called the Spring of Amphiaraos and the Alcyonian
Lake, through which the Argives say Dionysus went down to Hades to bring
up Semele, adding that the descent here was shown him by Palymnus. There
is no limit to the depth of the Alcyonian Lake, and I know of nobody who
by any contrivance has been able to reach the bottom of it since not
even Nero, who had ropes made several stadium-lengths long and fastened
them together, tying lead to them, and omitting nothing that might help
his experiment, was able to discover any limit to its depth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.37.6">

This, too, I heard. The water of the lake is, to all appearance, calm
and quiet but, although it is such to look at, every swimmer who
ventures to cross it is dragged down, sucked into the depths, and swept
away. The circumference of the lake is not great, being about one-third
of a stadium-length. Upon its banks grow grass and rushes. The nocturnal
rites performed every year in honor of Dionysus I must not divulge to
the world at large.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.38.1">

Temenium is in Argive territory, and was named after Temenus, the son of
Aristomakhos. For, having seized and strengthened the position, he waged
therefrom with the Dorians the war against Tisamenus and the Achaeans.
On the way to Temenium from Lerna the river Phrixos empties itself into
the sea, and in Temenium is built a sanctuary of Poseidon, as well as
one of Aphrodite; there is also the tomb of Temenus, which is worshipped
by the Dorians in Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.38.2">

Fifty stadium-lengths, I conjecture, from Temenium is Nauplia, which at
the present day is uninhabited; its founder was Nauplios, reputed to be
a son of Poseidon and Amymone. Of the walls, too, ruins still remain and
in Nauplia are a sanctuary of Poseidon, harbors, and a spring called
Canathus. Here, say the Argives, Hērā bathes every year and recovers her
virginity.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.38.3">

This is one of the sayings told as a holy secret at the mysteries which
they celebrate in honor of Hērā. The story told by the people in Nauplia
about the ass, how by nibbling down the shoots of a vine he caused a
more plenteous crop of grapes in the future, and how for this reason
they have carved an ass on a rock, because he taught the pruning of
vines—all this I pass over as trivial.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.38.4">

From Lerna there is also another road, which skirts the sea and leads to
a place called Genesium. By the sea is a small sanctuary of Poseidon
Genesios. Next to this is another place, called Apobathmi (Steps). The
story is that this is the first place in Argolis where Danaos landed
with his daughters. From here we pass through what is called Anigraea,
along a narrow and difficult road, until we reach a tract on the left
which stretches down to the sea;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.38.5">

it is fertile in trees, especially the olive. As you go up inland from
this is a place where three hundred picked Argives fought for this land
with an equal number of specially chosen Lacedaemonian warriors.[^205]
All were killed except one Spartan and two Argives, and here were raised
the tombs for the dead. But the Lacedaemonians, having fought against
the Argives with all their forces, won a decisive victory; at first they
themselves enjoyed the fruits of the land, but afterwards they assigned
it to the Aeginetans, when they were expelled from their island by the
Athenians.[^206] In my time Thyreatis was inhabited by the Argives, who
say that they recovered it by the award of an arbitration.[^207]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.38.6">

As you go from these common graves you come to Athene, where Aeginetans
once made their home, another village Neris, and a third Eua, the
largest of the villages, in which there is a sanctuary of Polemocrates.
This Polemocrates is one of the sons of Makhaon, and the brother of
Alexanor; he cures the people of the district, and receives honors from
the neighbors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:2.38.7">

Above the villages extends Mount Parnon, on which the Lacedaemonian
border meets the borders of the Argives and Tegeatae. On the borders
stand stone figures of Hermes, from which the name of the place is
derived. A river called Tanaus, which is the only one descending from
Mount Parnon, flows through the Argive territory and empties itself into
the Gulf of Thyrea.

</div>

## Scroll III. Laconia

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.1">

After the figures of Hermes we reach Laconia on the west. According to
the tradition of the Lacedaemonians themselves, Lelex, an aboriginal was
the first king in this land, after whom his subjects were named Leleges.
Lelex had a son Myles, and a younger one Polycaon. Polycaon retired into
exile, the place of this retirement and its reason I will set forth
elsewhere. On the death of Myles his son Eurotas succeeded to the
throne. He led down to the sea by means of a trench the stagnant water
on the plain, and when it had flowed away, as what was left formed a
river-stream, he named it Eurotas.[^208]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.2">

Having no male issue, he left the kingdom to Lacedaemon, whose mother
was Taygete, after whom the mountain was named, while according to
report his father was none other than Zeus. Lacedaemon was wedded to
Sparta, a daughter of Eurotas. When he came to the throne, he first
changed the names of the land and its inhabitants, calling them after
himself, and next he founded and named after his wife a city, which even
down to our own day has been called Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.3">

Amyclas, too, son of Lacedaemon, wished to leave some memorial behind
him, and built a town in Laconia. Hyakinthos, the youngest and most
beautiful of his sons, died before his father, and his tomb is in
Amyklai below the image of Apollo. On the death of Amyclas the empire
came to Aigalus, the eldest of his sons, and afterwards, when Aigalus
died, to Cynortas. Cynortas had a son Oibalos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.4">

He took a wife from Argos, Gorgophone the daughter of Perseus, and begat
a son Tyndareus, with whom Hippokoön disputed about the kingship,
claiming the throne on the ground of being the eldest. With the end of
Icarius and his partisans he had surpassed Tyndareus in power, and
forced him to retire in fear; the Lacedaemonians say that he went to
Pellana, but a Messenian story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] about him is
that he fled to Aphareus in Messenia, Aphareus being the son of Perieres
and the brother of Tyndareus on his mother's side. The story goes on to
say that he settled at Thalamaiin Messenia, and that his children were
born to him when he was living there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.5">

Subsequently Tyndareus was brought back by Hēraklēs and recovered his
throne. His sons too became kings, as did Menelaos the son of Atreus and
son-in-law of Tyndareus, and Orestes the husband of Hermione the
daughter of Menelaos. On the return of the Herakleidai in the reign of
Tisamenus, son of Orestes, both districts, Messene and Argos, had kings
put over them; Argos had Temenus and Messene Kresphontes. In Lacedaemon,
as the sons of Aristodemos were twins, there arose two royal houses; for
they say that the Pythian priestess approved.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.6">

Tradition has it that Aristodemos himself died at Delphi before the
Dorians returned to the Peloponnesus, but those who glorify his fate
assert that he was shot by Apollo for not going to the oracle, having
learned from Hēraklēs, who met him before he arrived there, that the
Dorians would make this return to the Peloponnesus. But the more correct
account is that Aristodemos was murdered by the sons of Pylades and
Electra, who were cousins of Tisamenus son of Orestes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.7">

The names given to the sons of Aristodemos were Prokles and Eurysthenes,
and although they were twins they were bitter enemies. Their enmity
reached a high pitch, but nevertheless they combined to help Theras, the
son of Autesion and the brother of their mother Argeia and their
guardian as well, to found a colony. This colony Theras was dispatching
to the island that was then called Kalliste,[^209] and he hoped that the
descendants of Membliarus would of their own accord give up the kingship
to him. This as a matter of fact they did,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.8">

taking into account that the lineage of Theras went back to Kadmos
himself, while they were only descendants of Membliarus, who was a man
of the people whom Kadmos left in the island to be the leader of the
settlers. And Theras changed the name of the island, renaming it after
himself, and even at the present day the people of Thera every year
offer to him as their founder the sacrifices that are given to a hero.
Prokles and Eurysthenes were of one mind in their eagerness to serve
Theras; but in all else their purposes were always widely different.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.1.9">

Even if they had agreed together, I should never have ventured to
include their descendants in a common list; for they did not altogether
coincide in respect of age, so that cousins, cousins' children, and
later generations were not born so as to make the steps in one pedigree
coincide with those of the other. So I shall give the history of each
house by itself separately, instead of combining them both in one
narrative.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.2.1">

Eurysthenes, the elder of the sons of Aristodemos, had, they say, a son
Agis, after. whom the lineage of Eurysthenes is called the Agiadai. In
his time, when Patreus the son of Preugenes was founding in Achaea a
city which even at the present day is called Patrai from this Patreus,
the Lacedaemonians took part in the settlement. They also joined in an
expedition oversea to establish a colony. Gras the son of Ekhelas the
son of Penthilos the son of Orestes was the leader, who was destined to
occupy the land between Ionia and Mysia, called at the present day
Aeolis; his ancestor Penthilos had even before this seized the island of
Lesbos, which faces this part of the mainland.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.2.2">

When Ekhestratos, son of Agis, was king at Sparta, the Lacedaemonians
removed all the Cynurians of military age, alleging as a reason that
freebooters from the Cynurian territory were harrying Argolis, the
Argives being their kinsmen, and that the Cynurians themselves openly
made forays into the land. The Cynurians are said to be Argives by
descent, and tradition has it that their founder was Cynurus, son of
Perseus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.2.3">

Not many years afterwards Labotas, son of Ekhestratos, became king in
Sparta. This Labotas Herodotus, in his history of Croesus, says was in
his childhood the ward of Lycurgus (Lykourgos) the lawgiver, but he
calls him Leobotes and not Labotas. It was then that the Lacedaemonians
first resolved to make war upon the Argives, bringing as charges against
them that they were annexing the Cynurian territory which they
themselves had captured, and were causing revolts among their subjects
the Perioeci (Dwellers around). On this occasion neither of the
belligerents, according to the account, achieved anything worthy of
mention,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.2.4">

and the next kings of this house, Doryssus, son of Labotas, and
Agesilaos, son of Doryssus, were soon both killed. Lycurgus (Lykourgos)
too laid down their laws for the Lacedaemonians in the reign of
Artesilaos; some say that he was taught how to do this by the Pythian
priestess, others that he introduced Cretan institutions. The Cretans
say that these laws of theirs were laid down by Minos, and that Minos
was not without divine aid in his deliberations concerning them. Homer
too, I think, refers in riddling words to the legislation of Minos in
the following verses:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Knossos too, great city, among them, where Minos for nine years

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Ruled as king, and enjoyed familiar converse with great Zeus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.2.5">

Of Lycurgus (Lykourgos) I shall make further mention later. Agesilaos
had a son Arkhelaos. In his reign the Lacedaemonians took by force of
arms Aigys, a city of the Perioeci, and sold the inhabitants into
slavery, suspecting them of Arcadian sympathies. Kharilaos, the king of
the other house, helped Arkhelaos to destroy Aigys, but the exploits he
achieved when leading the Lacedaemonians by himself, these too I shall
relate when my narrative comes to treat of those called the
Eurypontidai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.2.6">

Arkhelaos had a son Teleklos. In his reign the Lacedaemonians conquered
in war and reduced Amyklai, Pharis, and Geranthrae, cities of the
Perioeci, which were still in the possession of the Achaeans. The
inhabitants of Pharis and Geranthrae, panic-stricken at the onslaught of
the Dorians, made an agreement to retire from the Peloponnesus under a
truce, but those of Amyklai were not driven out at the first assault,
but only after a long and stubborn resistance, in which they
distinguished themselves by glorious achievements. To this heroism the
Dorians bore witness by raising a trophy against the Amyklaians,
implying that their success was the most memorable exploit of that time.
Not long after this Teleklos was murdered by Messenians in a sanctuary
of Artemis. This sanctuary was built on the frontier of Laconia and
Messenia, in a place called Limniai(Lakes).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.2.7">

After the death of Teleklos, Alkamenes his son succeeded to the throne,
and the Lacedaemonians sent to Crete Kharmidas the son of Euthys, who
was a distinguished Spartan, to put down the civil strife among the
Cretans, to persuade them to abandon the weak, inland towns, and to help
them to people instead those that were conveniently situated for the
coasting voyage. They also laid waste Helos, an Achaean town on the
coast, and won a battle against the Argives who came to give aid to the
Helots.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.1">

On the death of Alkamenes, Polydoros his son succeeded to the throne,
and the Lacedaemonians sent colonies to Croton in Italy and to the
people of Lokris \[= Lokroi\] by the Western headland. The war called
the Messenian reached its height in the reign of this king. As to the
causes of the war, the Lacedaemonian version differs from the Messenian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.2">

The accounts given by the belligerents, and the manner in which this war
ended, will be set forth later in my narrative. For the present I must
state thus much; the chief leader of the Lacedaemonians in the first war
against the Messenians was Theopompos the son of Nikandros, a king of
the other house. When the war against Messene had been fought to a
finish, and Messenia was enslaved to the Lacedaemonians, Polydoros, who
had a great reputation at Sparta and was very popular with the
masses—for he never did a violent act or said an insulting word to
anyone, while as a judge he was both upright and humane—

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.3">

his fame having by this time spread throughout Greece, was murdered by
Polemarkhos, a member of a distinguished family in Lacedaemon, but, as
he showed, a man of an unscrupulous temper. After his death Polydoros
received many signal marks of respect from the Lacedaemonians. However,
Polemarkhos too has a tomb in Sparta; either he had been considered a
good man before this murder, or perhaps his relatives buried him
secretly.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.4">

During the reign of Eurycrates, son of Polydoros, the Messenians
submitted to be subjects of the Lacedaemonians, neither did any trouble
befall from the Argive people. But in the reign of Anaxandros, son of
Eurycrates—for destiny was by this time driving the Messenians out of
all the Peloponnesus—the Messenians revolted from the Lacedaemonians.
For a time they held out by force of arms, but at last they were
overcome and retired from the Peloponnesus under a truce. The remnant of
them left behind in the land became the slaves of the Lacedaemonians,
with the exception of those in the towns on the coast.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.5">

The incidents of the war which the Messenians waged after the revolt
from the Lacedaemonians it is not pertinent that I should set forth in
the present part of my narrative. Anaxandros had a son Eurycrates, and
this second Eurycrates a son Leon. While these two kings were on the
throne the Lacedaemonians were generally unsuccessful in the war with
Tegea. But in the reign of Anaxandrides, son of Leon, the Lacedaemonians
won the war with Tegea in the following manner. A Lacedaemonian, by name
Lichas, came to Tegea when there chanced to be a truce between the
cities.[^210]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.6">

When Lichas arrived the Spartans were seeking the bones of Orestes in
accordance with an oracle. Now Lichas inferred that they were buried in
a smithy, the reason for this inference being this. Everything that he
saw in the smithy he compared with the oracle from Delphi, likening to
the winds the bellows, for that they too sent forth a violent blast, the
hammer to the “stroke,” the anvil to the “counterstroke” to it, while
the iron is naturally a “woe to man,” because already men were using
iron in warfare. In the time of those called heroes the god would have
called bronze a woe to man.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.7">

Similar to the oracle about the bones of Orestes was the one afterwards
given to the Athenians, that they were to bring back Theseus from Scyros
to Athens otherwise they could not take Scyros. Now the bones of Theseus
were discovered by Kimon the son of Miltiades, who displayed similar
sharpness of wit, and shortly afterwards took Scyros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.8">

I have evidence that in the heroic age weapons were universally of
bronze in the verses of Homer[^211] about the axe of Peisandros and the
arrow of Meriones. My statement is likewise confirmed by the spear of
Achilles dedicated in the sanctuary of Athena at Phaselis, and by the
sword of Memnon in the temple of Asklepios at Nikomedeia. The point and
butt-spike of the spear and the whole of the sword are made of bronze.
The truth of these statements I can vouch for.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.9">

Anaxandrides the son of Leon was the only Lacedaemonian to possess at
one and the same time two wives and two households. For his first
consort, though an excellent wife, had the misfortune to he barren. When
the ephors told him to put her away he firmly refused to do so, but made
this concession to them, that he would take another wife in addition to
her. The fruit of this union was a son, Kleomenes; and the former wife,
who up to this time had not conceived, after the birth of Cieomenes bore
Dorieus, then Leonidas, and finally Kleombrotos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.3.10">

And when Anaxandrides died, the Lacedaemonians, believing Dorieus to be
both of a sounder judgment than Kleomenes and a better soldier, much
against their will rejected him as their king, and obeyed the laws by
giving the throne to the elder claimant Kleomenes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.1">

Now Dorieus could not bear to stay at Lacedaemon and be subject to his
brother, and so he went on a colonizing expedition. As soon as he became
king, Kleomenes gathered together an army, both of the Lacedaemonians
themselves and of their allies, and invaded Argolis. The Argives came
out under arms to meet them, but Kleomenes won the day. Near the
battlefield was a grove sacred to Argos, son of Niobe, and on being
routed some five thousand of the Argives took refuge therein. Kleomenes
was subject to fits of mad excitement, and on this occasion he ordered
the Helots to set the grove on fire, and the flames spread all over the
grove, which, as it burned, burned up the suppliants with it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.2">

He also conducted campaigns against Athens, by the first of which he
delivered the Athenians from the sons of Peisistratos and won a good
report among the Greeks both for himself personally and for the
Lacedaemonians;[^212] while the second campaign was to please an
Athenian, Isagoras, by helping him to establish a tyranny over
Athens.[^213] When he was disappointed, and the Athenians fought
strenuously for their freedom, Kleomenes devastated the country,
including, they say, the district called Orgas, which was sacred to the
deities in Eleusis. He advanced as far as Aegina, and proceeded to
arrest such influential Aeginetans as had shown Persian sympathies, and
had persuaded the citizens to give earth and water to king Dareios, son
of Hystaspes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.3">

While Kleomenes was occupied in Aegina, Demaratos, the king of the other
house, was slandering him to the Lacedaemonian populace. On his return
from Aegina, Kleomenes began to intrigue for the deposition of king
Demaratos. He bribed the Pythian prophetess to frame responses about
Demaratos according to his instructions, and instigated Leotykhides, a
man of royal birth and of the same family as Demaratos, to put in a
claim to the throne.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.4">

Leotykhides seized upon the remark that Ariston in his ignorance blurted
out when Demaratos was born, denying that he was his child. On the
present occasion the Lacedaemonians, according to their wont, referred
to the oracle at Delphi the claim against Demaratos, and the prophetess
gave them a response which favored the designs of Kleomenes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.5">

So Demaratos was deposed, not rightfully, but because Kleomenes hated
him. Subsequently Kleomenes met his end in a fit of madness for seizing
a sword he began to wound himself, and hacked and maimed his body all
over. The Argives assert that the manner of his end was a punishment for
his treatment of the suppliants of Argos; the Athenians say that it was
because he had devastated Orgas; the Delphians put it down to the bribes
he gave the Pythian prophetess, persuading her to give lying responses
about Demaratos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.6">

It may well be too that the wrath of heroes and the wrath of gods united
together to punish Kleomenes since it is a fact that for a personal
wrong Protesilaos, a hero not a bit more illustrious than Argos,
punished at Elaeus Artayctes, a Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persēs</span>\]; while the
Megarians never succeeded in propitiating the deities at Eleusis for
having encroached upon the sacred land. As to the tampering with the
oracle, we know of nobody, with the exception of Kleomenes, who has had
the audacity even to attempt it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.7">

Kleomenes had no male issue, and the kingdom devolved on Leonidas, son
of Anaxandrides and full brother of Dorieus. At this time Xerxes led his
host against Greece, and Leonidas with three hundred Lacedaemonians met
him at Thermopylae. Now although the Greeks have waged many wars, and so
have barbarians among themselves, yet there are but few that have been
made more illustrious by the exceptional valor of one man, in the way
that Achilles shed luster on the Trojan war and Miltiades on the
engagement at Marathon. But in truth the success of Leonidas surpassed,
in my opinion, all later as well as all previous achievements.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.8">

For Xerxes, the proudest of all who have reigned over the Medes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Mēdoi</span>\], or over the
Persians \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] who
succeeded them, the achiever of such brilliant exploits, was met on his
march by Leonidas and the handful of men he led to Thermopylae,[^214]
and they would have prevented him from even seeing Greece at all, and
from ever burning Athens, if the man of Trakhis had not guided the army
with Hydarnes by the path that stretches across Oitē, and enabled the
enemy to surround the Greeks; so Leonidas was overwhelmed and the
barbarians passed along into Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.9">

Pausanias the son of Kleombrotos never became king. For while guardian
of Pleistarkhos, the son of Leonidas, who was a child when his father
died, he led the Lacedaemonians to Plataea, and afterwards with their
fleet to the Hellespont.[^215] I cannot praise too highly the way in
which Pausanias treated the Coan lady, who was the daughter of a man of
distinction among the people of Kos, Hegetorides the son of Antagoras,
and the unwilling concubine of a Persian \[Persēs\], Pharandates the son
of Teaspis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.4.10">

When Mardonios fell in the battle of Plataea, and the barbarians were
destroyed, Pausanias sent the lady back to Kos, and she took with her
the apparel that the Persian \[Persēs\] had procured for her as well as
the rest of her belongings. Pausanias also refused to dishonor the body
of Mardonios, as Lampon the Aeginetan advised him to do.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.1">

Shortly after Pleistarkhos the son of Leonidas came to the throne he
died, and the kingdom devolved on Pleistoanax, son of the Pausanias who
commanded at Plataea. Pleistoanax had a son Pausanias; he was the
Pausanias who invaded Attica, ostensibly to oppose Thrasyboulos and the
Athenians, but really to establish firmly the despotism of those to whom
the government had been entrusted by Lysander.[^216] Although he won a
battle against the Athenians holding the Peiraens, yet immediately after
the battle he resolved to lead his army back home, and not to bring upon
Sparta the most disgraceful of reproaches by increasing the despotic
power of wicked men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.2">

When he returned from Athens with only a fruitless battle to his credit,
he was brought to trial by his enemies. The court that sat to try a
Lacedaemonian king consisted of the senate, “old men” as they were
called, twenty eight in number, the members of the ephorate, and in
addition the king of the other house. Fourteen senators, along with
Agis, the king of the other house, declared that Pausanias was guilty;
the rest of the court voted for his acquittal.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.3">

Shortly after this the Lacedaemonians gathered an army against Thebes;
the reason for so doing will be given in my account of Agesilaos. On
this occasion Lysander came to Phokis, took along with him the entire
army of Phokis, and without any further delay entered Boeotia and began
assaults upon the wall of Haliartos, the citizens of which refused to
revolt from Thebes. Already a band of Thebans and Athenians had secretly
entered the city; these came out and offered battle before the wall, and
there fell here several Lacedaemonians, including Lysander himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.4">

Pausanias was too late for the fight, having been collecting forces from
Tegea and Arcadia generally; when he finally reached Boeotia, although
he heard of the defeat of the forces with Lysander and of the death of
Lysander himself, he nevertheless led his army against Thebes and
purposed to take the offensive. Thereupon the Thebans offered battle,
and Thrasyboulos was reported to be not far away with the Athenians. He
was waiting for the Lacedaemonians to take the offensive, on which his
intention was to launch an attack himself against their rear.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.5">

So Pausanias, fearing lest he should be caught between two enemy forces,
made a truce with the Thebans and took up for burial those who had
fallen under the wall of Haliartos. The Lacedaemonians disapproved of
this decision, but the following reason leads me to approve it.
Pausanias was well aware that the disasters of the Lacedaemonians always
took place when they had been caught between two enemy forces, and the
defeats at Thermopylae and on the island of Sphakteria made him afraid
lest he himself should prove the occasion of a third misfortune for
them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.6">

But when his fellow citizens charged him with his slowness in this
Boeotian campaign, he did not wait to stand his trial, but was received
by the people of Tegea as a suppliant of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aléā</span>. Now this sanctuary
had been respected from early days by all the Peloponnesians, and
afforded peculiar safety to its suppliants, as the Lacedaemonians showed
in the case of Pausanias and of Leotykhides before him, and the Argives
in the case of Khrysis; they never wanted even to ask for these
refugees, who were sitting as suppliants in the sanctuary, to be given
up.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.7">

When Pausanias fled, his sons Agesipolis and Kleombrotos were still
quite boys, and Aristodemos, their nearest relative, was their guardian.
This Aristodemos was in command of the Lacedaemonians when they won
their success in Corinth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.8">

When Agesipolis grew up and came to the throne, the first Peloponnesians
against whom he waged war were the Argives. When he led his army from
the territory of Tegea into that of Argos, the Argives sent a herald to
make for them with Agesipolis a certain ancestral truce, which from
ancient times had been an established custom between Dorians and
Dorians. But Agesipolis did not make the truce with the herald, but
advancing with his army proceeded to devastate the land. Then there was
an earthquake, but not even so would Agesipolis consent to take away his
forces. And yet more than any other Greeks were the Lacedaemonians (in
this respect like the Athenians) frightened by signs from the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dio-sēmeiai</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.5.9">

By the time that he was encamping under the wall of Argos, the
earthquakes were still occurring, some of the troops had actually been
killed by lightning, and some moreover had been driven out of then
senses by the thunder. In this circumstance he reluctantly withdrew from
Argive territory, and began another campaign, attacking Olynthus.
Victorious in the war, having captured most of the cities in Khalkidike,
and hoping to capture Olynthus itself, he was suddenly attacked by a
disease which ended in his death.[^217]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.1">

As Agesipolis died childless, the kingdom devolved upon Kleombrotos, who
was general in the battle at Leuktra against the Boeotians.[^218]
Kleombrotos showed personal bravery, but fell when the battle was only
just beginning. In great disasters Providence is peculiarly apt to cut
off early the general, just as the Athenians lost Hippocrates the son of
Ariphron, who commanded at Delium, and later on Leosthenes in
Thessaly.[^219]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.2">

Agesipolis, the elder of the sons of Kleombrotos, is not a striking
figure in history, and was succeeded by his younger brother Kleomenes.
His first son was Akrotatos, his second Kleonymos. Akrotatos did not
outlive his father, and when Kleomenes afterwards died, there arose a
dispute about the throne between Kleonymos the son of Kleomenes and
Areus the son of Akrotatos. So the senators acted as arbitrators, and
decided that the dignity was the inheritance of Areus the son of
Akrotatos, and not of Kleonymos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.3">

Deprived of his kingship Kleonymos became violently angry, and the
ephors tried to soothe his feelings by bestowing upon him various
honors, especially the leadership of the armies, so as to prevent his
becoming one day an enemy of Sparta. But at last he committed many
hostile acts against his fatherland, and induced Pyrrhos the son of
Aiakidēs to invade Laconia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.4">

While Areus the son of Akrotatos was king in Sparta, Antigonos the son
of Demetrios attacked Athens with an army and a fleet.[^220] To the help
of the Athenians there came the Egyptian expedition with Patroklos, and
every available man of the Lacedaemonians with Areus their king at their
head.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.5">

Antigonos invested Athens and prevented the Athenian reinforcements from
entering the city; so Patroklos dispatched messengers urging Areus and
the Lacedaemonians to take the offensive against Antigonos. On their
doing so, he would himself, he said, attack the Macedonians in rear; but
before such a move it was not fair for Egyptian sailors to attack
Macedonians on land. The Lacedaemonians were eager to make the venture,
both because of their friendship for Athens and also because they were
ambitious to hand down to posterity a famous achievement,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.6">

but as their supplies were exhausted Areus led his army back home,
thinking that desperate measures should be reserved for one’s own
advantage and not risked recklessly for the benefit of others. After
they had held out as long as they could, Antigonos made peace with the
Athenians, on condition that he brought a garrison into the Museum to be
a guard over them. After a time Antigonos himself removed the garrison
from Athens of his own accord while Areus begat Akrotatos, and Akrotatos
Areus, who died of disease when he was just about eight years old.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.7">

And as the only male representative of the house of Eurysthenes was
Leonidas the son of Kleonymos, by this time a very old man, the
Lacedaemonians gave him the throne. Leonidas, it so happened, had a
bitter opponent in Lysander, a descendant of Lysander the son of
Aristokritos. This Lysander won over to his side Leonidas’ son-in-law
Kleombrotos. After gaining his support he brought various charges
against Leonidas, in particular that when a boy he had sworn to his
father Kleonymos to ruin Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.8">

So Leonidas ceased to be king and Kleombrotos came to the throne in his
stead. Now if Leonidas had given way to impulse and retired, like
Demaratos the son of Ariston, either to the king of Macedonia or to the
Egyptian king, he would have profited nothing even by the Spartans
changing their minds. But as it was, when the citizens sentenced him to
exile, he went to Arcadia, whence not many years later he was recalled
by the Lacedaemonians, who made him king again.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.6.9">

Now how Kleomenes the son of Leonidas performed daring feats of valor,
and how after him the Spartans ceased to be ruled by kings, I have
already shown in my account of Aratos of Sikyon. My narrative also
included the manner of his death in Egypt.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.1">

So of the lineage of Eurysthenes, called the Agiadae, Kleomenes the son
of Leonidas was the last king in Sparta. I will now relate what I have
heard about the other house. Prokles the son of Aristodemos called his
son Sous, whose son Eurypon they say reached such a pitch of renown that
this house, hitherto called the Prokleidai, came to be named after him
the Eurypontidai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.2">

The son of Eurypon was Prytanis, in whose reign began the enmity of the
Lacedaemonians against the Argives, although even before this quarrel
they made war against the Cynurians. During the generations immediately
succeeding this, while Eunomos the son of Prytanis and Polydektes the
son of Eunomos were on the throne, Sparta continued at peace,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.3">

but Kharillos the son of Polydektes devastated the land of the
Argives—for he it was who invaded Argolis—and not many years afterwards,
under the leadership of Kharillos, took place the campaign of the
Spartans against Tegea, when lured on by a deceptive oracle the
Lacedaemonians hoped to capture the city and to annex the Tegean plain
from Arcadia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.4">

After the death of Kharillos, Nikandros his son succeeded to the throne,
in whose reign the Messenians murdered, in the sanctuary of the Lady of
the Lake, Teleklos the king of the other house. Nikandros also invaded
Argolis with an army, and laid waste the greater part of the land. The
Asinaeans took part in this action with the Lacedaemonians, and shortly
after were punished by the Argives, who inflicted great destruction on
their fatherland and drove out the inhabitants.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.5">

About Theopompos, the son of Nikandros, who ascended the throne after
him, I shall have more to say later on, when I come to the history of
Messenia. While Theopompos was still king in Sparta there also took
place the struggle of the Lacedaemonians with the Argives for what is
called the Thyreatid district. Theopompos personally took no part in the
affair, chiefly because of old age and sorrow, for while he was yet
alive Arkhidamos died.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.6">

Nevertheless Arkhidamos did not die childless, but left a son
Zeuxidamos, whose son Anaxidamos succeeded to the throne. In his reign
the Messenians were expelled from the Peloponnesus, being vanquished for
the second time by the Spartans. Anaxidamos begat Arkhidamos, and
Arkhidamos begat Agesikles. It was the lot of both of these to pass all
their lives in peace, undisturbed by any wars.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.7">

Ariston, son of Agesikles, married a wife who, they say, was the ugliest
girl in Sparta, but became the most beautiful of her women, because
Helen changed her; seven months only after his marriage with her Ariston
had born to him a son, Demaratos. As he was sitting in council with the
ephors there came to him a servant with the news that a child was born
to him. Ariston, forgetting the lines in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> about the birth of
Eurystheus, or else never having understood them at all, declared that
because of the number of months the child was not his.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.8">

Afterwards he repented of his words. Demaratos, a king of good repute at
Sparta, particularly for his helping Kleomenes to free Athens from the
Peisistratidai,[^221] became a private citizen through the
thoughtlessness of Ariston and the hatred of Kleomenes. He went over to
the Persians \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\]
to stay with king Dareios the king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\], and they
say that his descendants remained in Asia for a long time.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.9">

Leotykhides, on coming to the throne in place of Demaratos, took part
with the Athenians and the Athenian general Xanthippos, the son of
Ariphron, in the engagement of Mykale,[^222] and afterwards undertook a
campaign against the Aleuadaiin Thessaly. Although his uninterrupted
victories in the fighting might have enabled him to reduce all Thessaly,
he accepted bribes from the Aleuadae.[^223]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.10">

Or, being brought to trial in Lacedaemon he voluntarily went into exile
to Tegea, where he sought sanctuary as a suppliant of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aléā</span>. Zeuxidamos, the son
of Leotykhides, died of disease while Leotykhides was still alive and
before he retired into exile so his son Arkhidamos succeeded to the
throne after the departure of Leotykhides for Tegea. This Arkhidamos did
terrible damage to the land of the Athenians, invading Attica with an
army every year, on each occasion carrying destruction from end to end;
he also besieged and took Plataea, which was friendly to Athens.[^224]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.7.11">

Nevertheless he was not eager that war should be declared between the
Peloponnesians and the Athenians, but to the utmost of his power tried
to keep the truce between them unbroken.[^225] It was Sthenelaidas, an
influential Spartan who was an ephor at the time, who was chiefly
responsible for the war. Greece, that still stood firm, was shaken to
its foundations by this war, and afterwards, when the structure had
given way and was far from sound, was finally overthrown by Philip the
son of Amyntas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.1">

Arkhidamos left sons when he died, of whom Agis was the elder and
inherited the throne instead of Agesilaos. Arkhidamos had also a
daughter, whose name was Kyniska; she was exceedingly ambitious to
succeed at the Olympic games, and was the first woman to breed horses
and the first to win an Olympic victory. After Kyniska other women,
especially women of Lacedaemon, have won Olympic victories, but none of
them was more distinguished for their victories than she.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.2">

The Spartans seem to me to be of all men the least moved by poetry and
the praise of poets. For with the exception of the epigram upon Kyniska,
of uncertain authorship, and the still earlier one upon Pausanias that
Simonides wrote on the tripod dedicated at Delphi, there is no poetic
composition to commemorate the doings of the royal houses of the
Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.3">

In the reign of Agis the son of Arkhidamos the Lacedaemonians had
several grievances against the people of Elis, being especially
exasperated because they were debarred from the Olympic games and the
sanctuary at Olympia. So they dispatched a herald commanding the people
of Elis to grant home-rule to Lepreum and to any other of their
neighbors[^226] that were subject to them. The people of Elis replied
that, when they saw the cities free that were neighbors of Sparta, they
would without delay set free their own subjects; whereupon the
Lacedaemonians under king Agis invaded the territory of Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.4">

On this occasion there occurred an earthquake, and the army retired home
after advancing as far as Olympia and the Alpheus but in the next year
Agis devastated the country and carried off most of the loot. Xenias, a
man of Elis who was a personal friend of Agis and the state-friend[^227]
of the Lacedaemonians, rose up with the rich citizens against the people
but before Agis and his army could come to their aid, Thrasydaeus, who
at this time championed the interests of the popular party at Elis,
overthrew in battle Xenias and his followers and cast them out of the
city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.5">

When Agis led back his army, he left behind Lysistratos, a Spartan, with
a portion of his forces, along with the refugees from Elis, that they
might help the Lepreans to ravage the land. In the third year of the
war[^228] the Lacedaemonians under Agis again prepared to invade the
territory of Elis. So Thrasydaeus and the people of Elis, reduced to
dire extremities, agreed to forgo their supremacy over their neighbors,
to dismantle the fortifications of their city, and to allow the
Lacedaemonians to sacrifice to the god and to compete in the games at
Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.6">

Agis used also to make continual incursions into Attica, and established
the fortified post at Decelea to annoy the Athenians.[^229] When the
Athenian navy was destroyed at Aigospotamoi,[^230] Lysander, the son of
Aristokritos, and Agis violated the oaths which the Lacedaemonians as a
state had sworn by the gods to the Athenians, and it was on their own
initiative, and without the approval of the Spartan state, that they put
before their allies the proposal to destroy Athens root and branch.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.7">

Such were the most remarkable military achievements of Agis. The rash
remark that Ariston made about Demaratos was also made by Agis about his
son Leotykhides; at the suggestion of some evil spirit he said in the
hearing of the ephors that he did not believe Leotykhides to be his son.
Yet Agis, too, repented afterwards; he was at the time being carried
home sick from Arcadia, and when he reached Heraia, he not only called
the people to witness that he sincerely believed Leotykhides to be his
very own son, but also with prayers and tears charged them to take the
tidings to the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.8">

After the death of Agis, Agesilaos tried to keep Leotykhides from the
throne, recalling to the minds of the Lacedaemonians what Agis once said
about Leotykhides. But the Arcadians from Heraia arrived and bore
witness for Leotykhides, stating what they had heard the dying Agis say.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.9">

Yet further fuel for the controversy between Agesilaos and Leotykhides
was supplied by the oracle that was delivered at Delphi to this effect:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Sparta beware! though haughty, pay heed to the warning I give thee.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Never let thy sound limbs give birth to a kingdom that lame is.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Too long then shalt thou lie in the clutches of desperate hardships;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Turmoil of war shall arise, o’erwhelming men in its billows.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.8.10">

Leotykhides on this occasion said that these words pointed to Agesilaos,
who was lame in one of his feet, while Agesilaos interpreted them as
alluding to the illegitimacy of Leotykhides. Although they might have
done so, the Lacedaemonians did not refer the disputed point to Delphi;
the reason was in my opinion that Lysander, the son of Aristokritos, an
active supporter of Agesilaos, would have him king at all costs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.1">

So Agesilaos, son of Arkhidamos, became king, and the Lacedaemonians
resolved to cross with a fleet to Asia in order to put down Artaxerxes,
son of Dareios.[^231] For they were informed by several of their
magistrates, especially by Lysander, that it was not Artaxerxes but
Cyrus who had been supplying the pay for the fleet during the war with
Athens. Agesilaos, who was appointed to lead the expedition across to
Asia and to be in command of the land forces, sent round to all parts of
the Peloponnesus, except Argos, and to the Greeks north of the Isthmus,
asking for allies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.2">

Now the Corinthians were most eager to take part in the expedition to
Asia, but considering it a bad omen that their temple of Zeus surnamed
Olympian had been suddenly burned down, they reluctantly remained
behind. The Athenians excused themselves on the ground that their city
was returning to its former state of prosperity after the Peloponnesian
war and the epidemic of plague, and the news brought by messengers, that
Konon, son of Timotheus, had gone up to the Persian king, strongly
confirmed them in their policy of inactivity.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.3">

The envoy dispatched to Thebes was Aristomelidas, the father of the
mother of Agesilaos, a close friend of the Thebans who, when the wall of
Plataea had been taken, had been one of the judges voting that the
remnant of the garrison should be put to death. Now the Thebans like the
Athenians refused, saying that they would give no help. When Agesilaos
had assembled his Lacedaemonian forces and those of the allies, and at
the same time the fleet was ready, he went to Aulis to sacrifice to
Artemis, because Agamemnon too had propitiated the goddess here before
leading the expedition to Troy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.4">

Agesilaos, then, claimed to be king of a more prosperous city than was
Agamemnon, and to be like him overlord of all Greece, and that it would
be a more glorious success to conquer Artaxerxes and acquire the riches
of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] than to
destroy the empire
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] of Priam. But
even as he was sacrificing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] armed Thebans
came upon him, threw down from the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] the still
burning thighs \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mëria</span>\]
of the sacrificial-victims
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereia</span>\], and drove
him from the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.5">

Though vexed that the sacrifice was not completed, Agesilaos
nevertheless crossed into Asia and launched an attack against Sardis,
for Lydia at this period was the most important district of lower Asia,
and Sardis, pre-eminent for its wealth and resources, had been assigned
as a residence to the satrap of the coast region, just as Susa had been
to the king himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.6">

A battle was fought on the plain of the Hermos with Tissaphernes, satrap
of the parts around Ionia, in which Agesilaos conquered the cavalry of
the Persians \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\]
and the infantry, of which the muster on this occasion had been
surpassed only in the expedition of Xerxes and in the earlier ones of
Dareios against the Scythians and against Athens. The Lacedaemonians,
admiring the energy of Agesilaos, added to his command the control of
the fleet. But Agesilaos made his brother-in-law, Peisandros, admiral,
and devoted himself to carrying on the war vigorously by land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.7">

The jealousy of some deity prevented him from bringing his plans to
their conclusion. For when Artaxerxes heard of the victories won by
Agesilaos, and how, by attending to the task that lay before him, he
advanced with his army even further and further, he put Tissaphernes to
death in spite of his previous services, and sent down to the sea
Tithraustes, a clever schemer who had some grudge against the
Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.8">

On his arrival at Sardes he at once thought out a plan by which to force
the Lacedaemonians to recall their army from Asia. He sent Timocrates, a
Rhodian, to Greece with money, instructing him to stir up in Greece a
war against the Lacedaemonians. Those who shared in this money are said
to have been the Argives Kylon and Sodamas, the Thebans Androkleides,
Ismenias and Amphithemis, the Athenians Cephalus and Epicrates, with the
Corinthians who had Argive sympathies, Polyanthes and Timolaos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.9">

But those who first openly started the war were the peoplefrom Amphissa
in Lokris. For there happened to be a piece of land the ownership of
which was a matter of dispute between the people of Lokris and the
people of Phokis. Egged on by Ismenias and his party at Thebes, the
people of Lokris cut the ripe wheat in this land and drove off the what
they had plundered. The men of Phokis on their side invaded Lokris with
all their forces, and laid waste the land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.10">

So the people of Lokris brought in the Thebans as allies, and devastated
Phokis. Going to Lacedaemon the men of Phokis inveighed against the
Thebans, and set forth what they had suffered at their hands. The
Lacedaemonians determined to make war against Thebes, chief among their
grievances being the outrageous way the Thebans behaved towards
Agesilaos when he was sacrificing at Aulis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.11">

The Athenians receiving early intimation of the Lacedaemonians’
intentions, sent to Sparta begging them to submit their grievances to a
court of arbitration instead of appealing to arms, but the
Lacedaemonians dismissed the envoys in anger. The sequel, how the
Lacedaemonians set forth and how Lysander died, I have already described
in my account of Pausanias.[^232]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.12">

And what was called the Corinthian war, which continually became more
serious, had its origin in the expedition of the Lacedaemonians into
Boeotia.[^233] So these circumstances compelled Agesilaos to lead his
army back from Asia. Crossing with his fleet from Abydos to Sestos he
passed through Thrace as far as Thessaly, where the Thessalians, to
please the Thebans, tried to prevent his further progress; there was
also an old friendship between them and Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.9.13">

But Agesilaos put the Thessalian cavalry to flight and passed through
Thessaly, and again made his way through Boeotia, winning a victory over
Thebes and the allies at Korōneia. When the Boeotians were put to
flight, certain of them took refuge in the sanctuary of Athena surnamed
Itonia. Agesilaos, although suffering from a wound received in the
battle, did not sin against the suppliants.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.1">

Not long afterwards the Corinthians in exile for pro-Spartan sympathies
held the Isthmian games. The Corinthians in the city made no move at the
time, through their fear of Agesilaos but when he marched to Sparta,
they too celebrated the Isthmian games along with the Argives. Agesilaos
again marched with an army against Corinth, and, as the festival
Hyakinthia was at hand, he gave the Amycleans leave to go back home and
perform the traditional rites in honor of Apollo and Hyakinthos. This
battalion was attacked on the way and annihilated by the Athenians under
Iphicrates.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.2">

Agesilaos went also to Aetolia to give assistance to the Aetolians, who
were hard pressed in a war with, the Acarnanians;[^234] these he
compelled to put an end to the war, although they had come very near
capturing Calydon and the other towns of the Aetolians. Afterwards he
sailed to Egypt, to protect the Egyptians who had revolted from the king
of Persia. Agesilaos performed many noteworthy achievements in Egypt,
but, being by this time ah old man, he died on the march. Then his dead
body was brought home, the Lacedaemonians buried it with greater honors
than they had given to any other king.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.3">

In the reign of Arkhidamos, son of Agesilaos, the people of Phokis
seized the sanctuary at Delphi.[^235] To help in a war with Thebes the
people of Phokis hired with its wealth independent mercenaries, but they
here also aided publicly by the Lacedaemonians and Athenians, the latter
calling to mind some old service rendered by the people of Phokis, the
former, too, pretending to be friends when their real reason was, I
think, hatred of the Thebans. Theopompos, son of Damasistratos, said
that Arkhidamos himself had a share of the Delphic money, and further
that Deinicha the wife of Arkhidamos, receiving a bribe from the chief
men of Phokis, made Arkhidamos more ready to bring them reinforcements.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.4">

To accept sacred money and to help men who had pillaged the most famous
of oracles I do not hold praiseworthy, but the following incident does
redound to his praise. The men of Phokis were contemplating the cruel
course of killing the Delphians of vigorous age, enslaving the women and
children, and levelling the city itself to the ground; it was due to the
intercession of Arkhidamos that they escaped this fate at the hands of
the men of Phokis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.5">

Arkhidamos afterwards also crossed over into Italy to help the people of
Tarentum to wage war against their barbarian neighbors. Here he was
killed by the barbarians, and his corpse missed burial owing to the
anger of Apollo. Agis, the elder son of this Arkhidamos, met his death
fighting against Antipatros and the Macedonians, but while the younger
son, Eudamidas, was king, the Lacedaemonians enjoyed peace. The history
of Agis, son of Eudamidas, and of Eurydamidas, son of Agis, my account
of Sikyon has already set forth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.6">

On the way from the Hermaithe whole of the region is full of oak trees.
The name of the district, Scotitas (Dark), is not due to the unbroken
woods but to Zeus surnamed Scotitas, and there is a sanctuary of Zeus
Scotitas on the left of the road and about ten stadium-lengths from it.
If you go back from the sanctuary to the road, advance a little and then
turn again to the left, you come to an image of Hēraklēs and a trophy,
which I was told Hēraklēs raised after killing Hippokoön and his sons.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.7">

The third branch from the straight road is on the right, and leads to
Caryae (Walnut trees) and to the sanctuary of Artemis. For Caryae is a
region sacred to Artemis and the nymphs, and here stands in the open an
image of Artemis Caryatis. Here every year the Lacedaemonian girls hold
chorus-dances, and they have a traditional native dance. On returning,
as you go along the highway, you come to the ruins of Sellasia. The
people of this city, as I have stated already, were sold into slavery by
the Achaeans after they had conquered in battle the Lacedaemonians under
their king Kleomenes, the son of Leonidas.[^236]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.10.8">

In Thornax, which you will reach as you go along, is an image of Apollo
Pythaeus, made after the style of the one at Amyklai; the fashion of it
I will describe when I come to speak of the latter. For in the eyes of
the Lacedaemonians the cult of the Amyklaian is the more distinguished,
so that they spent on adorning the image in Amyklai even the gold which
Croesus the Lydian sent for Apollo Pythaeus.[^237]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.1">

Farther on from Thornax is the city, which was originally named Sparta,
but in course of time came to be called Lacedaemon as well, a name which
till then belonged to the land. To prevent misconception, I added in my
account of Attica that I had not mentioned everything in order, but had
made a selection of what was most noteworthy. This I will repeat before
beginning my account of Sparta; for from the beginning the plan of my
work has been to discard the many trivial stories current among the
several communities, and to pick out the things most worthy of
mention—an excellent rule which I will never violate.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.2">

The Lacedaemonians who live in Sparta have a marketplace worth seeing;
the council-chamber of the senate, and the offices of the ephors, of the
guardians of the laws, and of those called the Bidiaeans, are all in the
marketplace. The senate is the council which has the supreme control of
the Lacedaemonian constitution, the other officials form the executive.
Both the ephors and the Bidiaeans are five in number; it is customary
for the latter to hold competitions for the boys, particularly the one
at the place called Platanistas (Plane tree Grove), while the ephors
transact the most serious business, one of them giving his name to the
year, just as in Athens this privilege belongs to one of those called
the Nine Arkhontes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.3">

The most striking feature in the marketplace is the stoa \[portico\]
that they call Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persikē</span>\] because it
was made from spoils taken in the wars with the Medes. In course of time
they have altered it until it is as large and as splendid as it is now.
On the pillars are white-marble figures of Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\], including
Mardonios, son of Gobryas. There is also a figure of Artemisia, daughter
of Lygdamis and queen of Halicarnassus. It is said that this lady
voluntarily joined the expedition of Xerxes against Greece and
distinguished herself at the naval engagement off Salamis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.4">

On the marketplace are temples; there is one of Caesar, the first Roman
to covet monarchy and the first emperor under the present constitution,
and also one to his son Augustus, who put the empire on a firmer
footing, and became a more famous and a more powerful man than his
father. His name “Augustus” means in Greek
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sebastos</span> \[‘revered’\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.5">

At the altar of Augustus they show a bronze statue of Agias. This Agias,
they say, by divining for Lysander captured the Athenian fleet at
Aigospotamoi with the exception of ten ships of war.[^238] These made
their escape to Cyprus; all the rest the Lacedaemonians captured along
with their crews. Agias was a son of Agelokhos, a son of Tisamenus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.6">

Tisamenus belonged to the lineage of the Iamidai at Elis, and an oracle
was given to him that he should win five most famous contests. So he
trained for the pentathlon at Olympia, but came away defeated. And yet
he was first in two events, beating Hieronymos of Andros in running and
in jumping. But when he lost the wrestling bout to this competitor, and
so missed the prize, he understood what the oracle meant, that the god
granted him to win five contests in war by his divinations.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.7">

The Lacedaemonians, hearing of the oracle the Pythian priestess had
given to Tisamenos, persuaded him to migrate from Elis and to be
state-diviner at Sparta. And Tisamenos won them five contests in
war.[^239] The first was at Plataea against the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\]; the second
was at Tegea, when the Lacedaemonians had engaged the Tegeans and
Argives; the third was at Dipaea, an Arcadian town in Mainalia, when all
the Arcadians except the Mantineians were arrayed against them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.8">

His fourth contest was against the Helots who had rebelled and left the
Isthmus for Ithome.[^240] Not all the Helots revolted, only the
Messenian element, which separated itself off from the old Helots. These
events I shall relate presently. On the occasion I mention the
Lacedaemonians allowed the rebels to depart under a truce, in accordance
with the advice of Tisamenos and of the oracle at Delphi. The last time
Tisamenos divined for them was at Tanagra, an engagement taking place
with the Argives and Athenians.[^241]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.9">

Such I learned was the history of Tisamenus. On their marketplace the
Spartans have images of Apollo Pythaeus, of Artemis and of Leto. The
whole of this region is called Choros (Dancing), because at the
Gymnopaediae, a festival which the Lacedaemonians take more seriously
than any other, the boys perform dances in honor of Apollo. Not far from
them is a sanctuary of Earth and of Zeus of the Marketplace, another of
Athena of the Marketplace and of Poseidon surnamed Securer, and likewise
one of Apollo and of Hērā.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.10">

There is also dedicated a colossal statue of the Spartan People. The
Lacedaemonians have also a sanctuary of the Fates, by which is the tomb
of Orestes, son of Agamemnon. For when the bones of Orestes were brought
from Tegea in accordance with an oracle they were buried here. Beside
the tomb of Orestes is a statue of Polydoros, son of Alkamenes, a king
who rose to such honor that the magistrates seal with his likeness
everything that requires sealing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.11.11">

There is also Hermes of the Marketplace carrying Dionysus as a child,
besides the old Courts of the Ephors, as they are called, in which are
the tombs of Epimenides the Cretan and of Aphareus the son of Perieres.
As to Epimenides, I think the Lacedaemonian story is more probable than
the Argive. Here, where the Fates are, the Lacedaemonians also have a
sanctuary of Hestia. There is also Zeus Hospitable and Athena
Hospitable.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.1">

As you go from the marketplace by the road they name the Aphetaid Road,
you come to the so-called Booneta.[^242] But my narrative must first
explain why the road has this name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.2">

It is said that Icarius proposed a foot-race for the wooers of Penelope;
that Odysseus won is plain, but they say that the competitors were let
go (aphethenai) for the race along the Aphetaid Road. In my opinion,
Icarius was imitating Danaos when he held the running-race. For Danaos
contrived the following plan to solve the difficulty about his
daughters. Nobody would take a wife from among them because of their
pollution so Danaos sent round a notice that he would give away his
daughters without bride-gifts, and that each suitor could choose the one
whose beauty pleased him most. A few men came, among whom he held a
foot-race the first comer was allowed to choose before all the others,
after him the second, and so on to the last. The daughters that were
left had to wait until other suitors arrived and competed in another
foot-race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.3">

On this road the Lacedaemonians have, as I have already said, what is
called the Booneta, which once was the house of their king Polydoros.
When he died, they bought it from his widow, paying the price in oxen.
For at that time there was as yet neither silver nor gold coinage, but
they still bartered in the old way with oxen, slaves, and uncoined
silver and gold.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.4">

Those who sail to India say that the natives give other merchandise in
exchange for Greek cargoes, knowing nothing about coinage, even though
they have plenty of gold and of bronze.

</div>

On the opposite side of the office of the Bidiaeans is a sanctuary of
Athena. Odysseus is said to have set up the image and to have named it
Keleuthea (Lady of the Road), when he had beaten the suitors of Penelope
in the foot-race. Of Keleuthea he set up sanctuaries, three in number,
at some distance from each other.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.5">

Farther along the Aphetaid Road are hero-shrines, of Iops, who is
supposed to have been born in the time of Lelex or. Myles, and of
Amphiaraos the son of Oikles. The last they think was made by the sons
of Tyndareus, for that Amphiaraos was their cousin. There is a
hero-shrine of Lelex himself. Not far from these is a precinct of
Poseidon of Taenarum, which is the surname given him, and near by an
image of Athena, which is said to have been dedicated by the colonists

who left for Tarentum in Italy. As to the place they call the HeIlenium,
it has been stated that those of the Greeks who were preparing to repel
Xerxes when he was crossing into Europe deliberated at this place how
they should resist. The other story is that those who made the
expedition against Troy to please Menelaos deliberated here how they
could sail out to Troy and exact satisfaction from Alexander for
carrying off Helen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.7">

Near the Hellenium they point out the tomb of Talthybios. The Achaeans
of Aigion too say that a tomb which they show on their marketplace
belongs to Talthybios. It was this Talthybios whose wrath at the murder
of the heralds, who were sent to Greece by king Dareios to demand earth
and water, left its mark upon the whole state of the Lacedaemonians, but
in Athens fell upon individuals, the members of the house of one man,
Miltiades the son of Kimon. Miltiades was responsible for the death at
the hands of the Athenians of those of the heralds who came to Attica.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.8">

The Lacedaemonians have an altar of Apollo Acritas, and a sanctuary,
surnamed Gasepton, of Earth. Above it is set up Maleatian Apollo. At the
end of the Aphetaid Road, quite close to the wall, are a sanctuary of
Dictynna and the royal tombs of those called the Eurypontidai. Beside
the Hellenium is a sanctuary of Arsinoe, daughter of Leukippos and
sister of the wives of Polydeukes and Castor (Kastor). At the place
called the Forts is a temple of Artemis, and a little further on has
been built a tomb for the diviners from Elis, called the Iamidai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.9">

There is also a sanctuary of Maron and of Alpheios. Of the
Lacedaemonians who served at Thermopylae they consider that these men
distinguished themselves in the fighting more than any save Leonidas
himself. The sanctuary of Zeus Tropaean (He who turns to flight) was
made by the Dorians, when they had conquered in war the Amyklaians, as
well as the other Achaeans, who at that time occupied Laconia. The
sanctuary of the Great Mother has paid to it the most extraordinary
honors. After it come the hero-shrines of Hippolytus, son of Theseus,
and of the Arcadian Aulon, son of Tlesimenes. Some say that Tlesimenes
was a brother, others a son of Parthenopaeus, son of Melanion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.10">

Leading from the marketplace is another road, on which they have built
what is called Scias (Canopy), where even at the present day they hold
their meetings of the Assembly. This Canopy was made, they say, by
Theodoros of Samos, who discovered the melting of iron and the moulding
of images from it.[^243] Here the Lacedaemonians hung the harp of
Timotheus of Miletus, to express their disapproval of his innovation in
harping, the addition of four strings to the seven old ones.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.12.11">

By the Canopy is a circular building, and in it images of Zeus and
Aphrodite surnamed Olympian. This, they say, was set up by Epimenides,
but their account of him does not agree with that of the Argives, for
the Lacedaemonians deny that they ever fought with the Cnossians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.1">

Hard by is the tomb of Cynortas son of Amyclas, together with the tomb
of Castor (Kastor), and over the tomb there has also been made a
sanctuary, for they say that it was not before the fortieth year after
the fight with Idas and Lynkeus that divine honors were paid to the sons
of Tyndareus. By the Canopy is also shown the tomb of Idas and Lynkeus.
Now it fits in best with their history to hold that they were buried not
here but in Messenia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.2">

But the disasters of the Messenians, and the length of their exile from
the Peloponnesus, even after their return wrapped in darkness much of
their ancient history, and their. ignorance makes it easy for any who
wish to dispute a claim with them.

Opposite the Olympian Aphrodite the Lacedaemonians have a temple of the
Savior Maiden. Some say that it was made by Orpheus the Thracian, others
by Abairis when he had come from the Hyperboreans.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.3">

Carneus, whom they surname “of the House,” had honors in Sparta even
before the return of the Herakleidai, his seat being in the house of a
seer, Crius (Ram) the son of Theokles. The daughter of this Crius was
met as she was filling her pitcher by spies of the Dorians, who entered
into conversation with her, visited Crius and learned from him how to
capture Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.4">

The cult of Apollo Carneus has been established among all the Dorians
ever since Carnus, an Acarnanian by birth, who was a seer of Apollo.
When he was killed by Hippotes the son of Phylas, the wrath of Apollo
fell upon the camp of the Dorians Hippotes went into banishment because
of the bloodguilt, and from this time the custom was established among
the Dorians of propitiating the Acarnanian seer. But this Carnus is not
the Lacedaemonian Carneus of the House, who was worshipped in the house
of Crius the seer while the Achaeans were still in possession of Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.5">

The poetess Praxilla represents Carneus as the son of Europa, Apollo and
Leto being his nurses. There is also another account of the name; in
Trojan Ida there grew in a grove of Apollo cornel trees, which the
Greeks cut down to make the Wooden Horse. Learning that the god was
angry with them they propitiated him with sacrifices and named Apollo
Carneus from the cornel tree (craneia), a custom prevalent in the olden
time making them transpose the

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.6">

Not far from Carneus is what is called the image of Aphetaeus. Here they
say was the starting-place of the race run by the suitors of Penelope.
There is a place having its porticoes in the form of a square, where of
old stuff used to be sold to the people. By this is an altar of Zeus
Counsellor and of Athena Counsellor, also of the Dioskouroi, likewise
surnamed Counsellors.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.7">

Opposite is what is called the Knoll, with a temple of Dionysus of the
Knoll, by which is a precinct of the hero who they say guided Dionysus
on the way to Sparta. To this hero sacrifices are offered before they
are offered to the god by the daughters of Dionysus and the daughters of
Leukippos. For the other eleven ladies who are named daughters of
Dionysus there is held a foot-race; this custom came to Sparta from
Delphi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.8">

Not far from the Dionysus is a sanctuary of Zeus of Fair Wind, on the
right of which is a hero-shrine of Pleuron. The sons of Tyndareus were
descended on their mother's side from Pleuron, for Asios in his poem
says that Thestios the father of Leda was the son of Agenor the son of
Pleuron. Not far from the hero-shrine is a hill, and on the hill a
temple of Argive Hērā, set up, they say, by Eurydikē, the daughter of
Lacedaemon and the wife of Akrisios the son of Abas. An oracular
utterance caused to be built a sanctuary of Hērā Hyperchemia (she whose
hand is above) at a time when the Eurotas was flooding a great part of
the land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.13.9">

An old wooden image they call that of Aphrodite Hērā. A mother is
accustomed to sacrifice to the goddess when a daughter is married. On
the road to the right of the hill is a statue of Hetoimokles. Both
Hetoimokles himself and his father Hipposthenes won Olympic victories
for wrestling the two together won eleven, but Hipposthenes succeeded in
beating his son by one victory.

On going westwards from the marketplace is a cenotaph of Brasidas the
son of Tellis.[^244] Not far from it is the theater, made of white
marble and worth seeing. Opposite the theater are two tombs; the first
is that of Pausanias, the general at Plataea, the second is that of
Leonidas. Every year they deliver speeches over them, and hold a contest
in which none may compete except Spartans. The bones of Leonidas were
taken by Pausanias from Thermopylae forty years after the battle. There
is set up a slab with the names, and their fathers’ names, of those who
endured the fight at Thermopylae against the Persians.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.2">

There is a place in Sparta called Theomelida. In this part of the city
are the tombs of the Agiad kings, and near is what is called the lounge
of the Crotani, who form a part of the Pitanatans. Not far from the
lounge is a sanctuary of Asklepios, called “in the place of the
Agiadae.” Farther on is the tomb of Taenarus, after whom they say the
headland was named that juts out into the sea. Here are sanctuaries of
Poseidon Hippocurius (Horse-tending) and of Artemis Aiginaia
(Goat-goddess?). On returning to the lounge you see a sanctuary of
Artemis Issoria. They surname her also Lady of the Lake, though she is
not really Artemis hut Britomartis of Crete. I deal with her in my
account of Aegina.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.3">

Very near to the tombs which have been built for the Agiadaiyou will see
a slab, on which are written the victories in the foot-race won, at
Olympia and elsewhere, by Khionis, a Lacedaemonian.[^245] The Olympian
victories were seven, four in the single-stadium-length race and three
in the double-stadium-length race.[^246] The race with the shield, that
takes place at the end of the contest, was not at that time one of the
events. It is said that Khionis also took part in the expedition of
Battos of Thera, helped him to found Cyrene and to reduce the
neighboring Libyans.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.4">

The sanctuary of Thetis was set up, they say, for the following reason.
The Lacedaemonians were making war against the Messenians, who had
revolted, and their king Anaxander, having invaded Messenia, took
prisoners certain women, and among them Kleo, priestess of Thetis. This
Kleo the wife of Anaxandros asked for from her husband, and discovering
that she had the wooden image of Thetis, she set up with her a temple
for the goddess. This Leandris did because of a vision in a dream,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.5">

but the wooden image of Thetis is guarded in secret. The cult of Demeter
Chthonia (of the Lower World) the Lacedaemonians say was handed on to
them by Orpheus, but in my opinion it was because of the sanctuary in
Hermione[^247] that the Lacedaemonians also began to worship Demeter
Chthonia. The Spartans have also a sanctuary of Serapis, the newest
sanctuary in the city, and one of Zeus surnamed Olympian.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.6">

The Lacedaemonians give the name Running Course to the place where it is
the custom for the young men even down to the present day to practice
running. As you go to this Course from the tomb of the Agiadae, you see
on the left the tomb of Eumedes—this Eumedes was one of the children of
Hippokoön—and also an old image of Hēraklēs, to whom sacrifice is paid
by the Sphaereis. These are those who are just passing from youth to
manhood. In the Course are two gymnastic schools, one being a votive
gift of Eurykles, a Spartan. Outside the Course, over against the image
of Hēraklēs, there is a house belonging now to a private individual, but
in olden times to Menelaos. Farther away from the Course are sanctuaries
of the Dioskouroi, of the Graces, of Eileithuia, of Apollo Carneus, and
of Artemis Leader.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.7">

The sanctuary of Agnitas has been made on the right of the Course;
Agnitas is a surname of Asklepios, because the god had a wooden image of
agnus castus. The agnus is a willow like the thorn. Not far from
Asklepios stands a trophy, raised, they say, by Polydeukes to celebrate
his victory over Lynkeus. This is one of the pieces of evidence that
confirm my statement that the sons of Aphareus were not buried in
Sparta. At the beginning of the Course are the Dioskouroi Starters, and
a little farther on a hero-shrine of Alcon, who they say was a son of
Hippokoön.

</div>

Beside the shrine of Alcon is a sanctuary of Poseidon, whom they surname
“of the House.”

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.8">

And there is a place called Platanistas (Plane tree Grove) from the
unbroken ring of tall plane trees growing round it. The place itself,
where it is customary for the youths to fight, is surrounded by a moat
just like an island in the sea; you enter it by bridges. On each of the
two bridges stand images; on one side an image of Hēraklēs, on the other
a likeness of Lycurgus (Lykourgos). Among the laws Lycurgus (Lykourgos)
laid down for the constitution are those regulating the fighting of the
youths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.9">

There are other acts performed by the youths, which I will now describe.
Before the fighting they sacrifice in the Phoebaeum, which is outside
the city, not far distant from Therapne. Here each company of youths
sacrifices a puppy to Enyalios, holding that the most valiant of tame
animals is an acceptable victim to the most valiant of the gods. I know
of no other Greeks who are accustomed to sacrifice puppies except the
people of Kolophon; these too sacrifice a puppy, a black bitch, to the
Wayside Goddess. Both the sacrifice of the Kolophonians and that of the
youths at Sparta are appointed to take place at night.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.14.10">

At the sacrifice the youths set trained boars to fight; the company
whose boar happens to win generally gains the victory in Plane tree
Grove. Such are the performances in the Phoebaeum. A little before the
middle of the next day they enter by the bridges into the place I have
mentioned. They cast lots during the night to decide by which entrance
each band is to go in. In fighting they use their hands, kick with their
feet, bite, and gouge out the eyes of their opponents. Man to man they
fight in the way I have described, but in the melee they charge
violently and push one another into the water.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.1">

At Plane tree Grove there is also a hero-shrine of Kyniska, daughter of
Arkhidamos king of the Spartans. She was the first woman to breed
horses, and the first to win a chariot-race at Olympia. Behind the
portico built by the side of Plane tree Grove are other hero-shrines, of
Alcimus, of Enaraephorus, at a little distance away one of Dorceus, and
close to it one of Sebrus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.2">

These are said to be sons of Hippokoön. The fountain near the
hero-shrine of Dorceus they call Dorcean after him; the place Sebrium is
named after Sebrus. On the right of Sebrium is the tomb of Alcman, the
lyric poet, the charm of whose works was not in the least spoilt by the
Laconian dialect, which is the least musical of them all.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.3">

There are sanctuaries of Helen and of Hēraklēs; the former is near the
tomb of Alcman, the latter is quite close to the wall and contains an
armed image of Hēraklēs. The attitude of the image is due, they say, to
the fight with Hippokoön and his sons. The enmity of Hēraklēs towards
the lineage of Hippokoön is said to have sprung out of their refusing to
purify him when he came to Sparta for purifying after the death of
Iphitos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.4">

The following incident, too, helped to begin the feud. Oeonus, a young
cousin of Hēraklēs—he was the son of Licymnius the brother of
Alcmene—came to Sparta along with Hēraklēs, and went round to view the
city. When he came to the house of Hippokoön, a house-dog attacked him.
Oeonus happened to throw a stone which knocked over the dog. So the sons
of Hippokoön ran out, and dispatched Oeonus with their clubs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.5">

This made Hēraklēs most bitterly angry with Hippokoön and his sons, and
straightway, angry as he was, he set out to give them battle. On this
occasion he was wounded, and made good his retreat by stealth but
afterwards he made an expedition against Sparta and succeeded in
avenging himself on Hippokoön, and also on the sons of Hippokoön for
their murder of Oeonus. The tomb of Oeonus is built by the side of the
sanctuary of Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.6">

As you go from the Course towards the east, there is a path on the
right, with a sanctuary of Athena called Axiopoinos (Just Requital or
Tit for Tat). For when Hēraklēs, in avenging himself on Hippokoön and
his sons, had inflicted upon them a just requital for their treatment of
his relative, he founded a sanctuary of Athena, and surnamed her
Axiopoinos because the ancients used to call vengeance poinai. There is
another sanctuary of Athena on another road from the Course. It was
dedicated, they say, by Theras son of Autesion son of Tisamenus son of
Thersandros, when he was leading a colony to the island now called Thera
after him, the name of which in ancient times was Kalliste (Fairest).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.7">

Near is a temple of Hipposthenes, who won so many victories in
wrestling. They worship Hipposthenes in accordance with an oracle,
paying him honors as to Poseidon. Opposite this temple is an old image
of Enyalios in fetters. The idea the Lacedaemonians express by this
image is the same as the Athenians express by their Wingless Victory;
the former think that Enyalios will never run away from them, being
bound in the fetters, while the Athenians think that Victory, having no
wings, will always remain where she is.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.8">

In this fashion, and with such a belief have these cities set up the
wooden images. In Sparta is a lounge called Painted, and by it
hero-shrines of Kadmos the son of Agenor, and of his descendants
Oiolykos, son of Theras, and Aigeus, son of Oiolykos. They are said to
have been made by Maesis, Laeas and Europas, sons of Hyraeus, son of
Aigeus. They made for Amphilokhos too his hero-shrine, because their
ancestor Tisamenus had for his mother Demonassa, the sister of
Amphilokhos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.9">

The Lacedaemonians are the only Greeks who surname Hērā Goat-eater, and
sacrifice goats to the goddess. They say that Hēraklēs founded the
sanctuary and was the first to sacrifice goats, because in his fight
against Hippokoön and his children he met with no hindrance from Hērā,
although in his other adventures he thought that the goddess opposed
him. He sacrificed goats, they say, because he lacked other kinds of
victims.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.15.10">

Not far from the theater is a sanctuary of Poseidon God of Kin, and
there are hero-shrines of Kleodaios, son of Hyllos, and of Oibalos. The
most famous of their sanctuaries of Asklepios has been built near
Boöneta, and on the left is the hero-shrine of Teleklos. I shall mention
him again later in my history of Messenia.[^248] A little farther on is
a small hill, on which is an ancient temple with a wooden image of
Aphrodite armed. This is the only temple I know that has an upper storey
built upon it.

It is a sanctuary of Morpho, a surname of Aphrodite, who sits wearing a
veil and with fetters on her feet. The story is that the fetters were
put on her by Tyndareus, who symbolized by the bonds the faithfulness of
wives to their husbands. The other account, that Tyndareus punished the
goddess with fetters because he thought that from Aphrodite had come the
shame of his daughters, I will not admit for a moment. For it were
surely altogether silly to expect to punish the goddess by making a
cedar figure and naming it Aphrodite.

Near is a sanctuary of Hilaeira and of Phoebe. The author of the poem
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Cypria</span> calls them daughters of
Apollo. Their priestesses are young maidens, called, as are also the
goddesses, Leukippides (Daughter of Leukippos).[^249] One of the images
was adorned by a Leucippis who had served the goddesses as a priestess.
She gave it a face of modern workmanship instead of the old one; she was
forbidden by a dream to adorn the other one as well. Here there his been
hung from the roof an egg tied to ribands, and they say that it is the
famous egg that, as the story

Each year the women weave a tunic for the Apollo at Amyklai, and they
call Tunic the chamber in which they do their weaving. Near it is built
a house, said to have been occupied originally by the sons of Tyndareus,
but afterwards it was acquired by Phormion, a Spartan. To him came the
Dioskouroi in the likeness of strangers. They said that they had come
from Cyrene, and asked to lodge with him, requesting to have the chamber
which had pleased them most when they dwelled among men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.3">

He replied that they might lodge in any other part of the house they
wished, but that they could not have the chamber.

For it so happened that his virgin daughter was living in it. By the
next day this maiden and all her girlish apparel had disappeared, and in
the room were found images of the Dioskouroi, a table, and silphium upon
it.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.4">

Such is the story. As you go from the Tunic in the direction of the gate
there is a hero-shrine of Kheilon, who is considered one of the Seven
Sages, and also of Athenodoros, one of those who with Dorieus the son of
Anaxandrides set out for Sicily. The reason of their setting out was
that they held that the Erycine district belonged to the descendants of
Hēraklēs and not to the barbarians who held it. The story is that
Hēraklēs wrestled with Eryx on these terms: if Hēraklēs won, the land of
Eryx was to belong to him but if he were beaten, Eryx was to depart with
the cows of Geryon;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.5">

for Hēraklēs at the time was driving these away, and when they swam
across to Sicily he too crossed over in search of them near the bent
olive tree. The good will \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\] was more
partial to Hēraklēs than it was afterwards to Dorieus the son of

The Lacedaemonians have also made a sanctuary for Lycurgus (Lykourgos),
who drew up the laws, looking upon him as a god. Behind the temple is
the tomb of Eukosmos, the son of Lycurgus (Lykourgos), and by the altar
the tomb of Lathria and Anaxandra. Now these were themselves twins, and
therefore the sons of Aristodemos, who also were twins likewise, took
them to wife; they were daughters of Thersandros son of Agamedidas, king
of the people of Kleonai and great-grandson of Ktesippos, son of
Hēraklēs. Opposite the temple is the tomb of Theopompos son of
Nikandros, and also that of Eurybiades, who commanded the Lacedaemonian
warships that fought the Persians at Artemisium and Salamis. Near is
what is called the hero-shrine of Astrabacus.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.7">

The place named Limnaeum (Marshy) is sacred to Artemis Orthia (Upright).
The wooden image there they say is that which once Orestes and
Iphigeneia stole out of the Tauric land, and the Lacedaemonians say that
it was brought to their land because there also Orestes was king. I
think their story more probable than that of the Athenians. For what
could have induced Iphigeneia to leave the image behind at Brauron? Or
why did the Athenians, when they were preparing to abandon their land,
fail to include this image in what they put on board their ships?

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.8">

And yet, right down to the present day, the fame of the Tauric goddess
has remained so high that the Cappadocians dwelling on the Euxine claim
that the image is among them, a like claim being made by those Lydians
also who have a sanctuary of Artemis Anaeitis. But the Athenians, we are
asked to believe, made light of the fact that it was plundered by the
Persians. For the image at Brauron was brought to Susa, and afterwards
Seleukos gave it to the Syrians of Laodicea, who still possess it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.9">

I will give other evidence that the Orthia in Lacedaemon is the wooden
image from the barbarians. Firstly, Astrabacus and Alopecus, sons of
Irbus, son of Amphisthenes, son of Amphikles, son of Agis, when they
found the image straightway became insane. Secondly, the Spartan
Limnatians, the Cynosurians, and the people of Mesoa and Pitane, while
sacrificing to Artemis, fell to quarreling, which led also to bloodshed;
many were killed at the altar and the rest died of disease.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.10">

Whereat an oracle was delivered to them, that they should stain the
altar with human blood. He used to be sacrificed upon whomsoever the lot
fell, but Lycurgus (Lykourgos) changed the custom to a scourging of the
boys, and so in this way the altar is stained with human blood. By them
stands the priestess, holding the wooden image. Now it is small and
light,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.16.11">

but if ever the scourgers spare the lash because of a boy’s beauty or
high rank, then at once the priestess finds the image grow so heavy that
she can hardly carry it. She lays the blame on the scourgers, and says
that it is their fault that she is being weighed down. So the image ever
since the sacrifices in the Tauric land keeps its fondness for human
blood. They call it not only Orthia, but also Lygodesma (Willow-bound),
because it was found in a thicket of willows, and the encircling willow
made the image stand upright.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.1">

Not far from the Orthia is a sanctuary of Eileithuia. They say that they
built it, and came to worship Eileithuia as a goddess, because of an
oracle from Delphi.

</div>

The Lacedaemonians have no citadel rising to a conspicuous height like
the Kadmeia at Thebes and the Larisa at Argos. There are, however, hills
in the city, and the highest of them they call the citadel.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.2">

Here is built a sanctuary of Athena, who is called both City-protecting
and Lady of the Bronze House. The building of the sanctuary was begun,
they say, by Tyndareus. On his death his children were desirous of
making a second attempt to complete the building, and the resources they
intended to use were the spoils of Aphidna. They too left it unfinished,
and it was many years afterwards that the Lacedaemonians made of bronze
both the temple and the image of Athena. The builder was Gitiadas, a
native of Sparta, who also composed Dorian lyrics, including a hymn to
the goddess.[^250]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.3">

On the bronze are made-in-relief many of the labors of Hēraklēs and many
of the voluntary exploits he successfully carried out, besides the
abduction of the daughters of Leukippos and other achievements of the
sons of Tyndareus. There is also Hephaistos releasing his mother from
the fetters. The things that are said about this I have already shown in
my write-up \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sungraphē</span>\]
about Attica.[^251] There are also represented nymphs bestowing upon
Perseus, who is starting on his enterprise against Medusa in Libya, a
cap and the shoes by which he was to be carried through the air. Also
crafted are the birth of Athena, Amphitrite, and Poseidon, the largest
figures, and those which I thought the best worth seeing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.4">

There is here another sanctuary of Athena; her surname is the Worker. As
you go to the south portico there is a temple of Zeus surnamed Kosmetas
(Orderer), and before it is the tomb of Tyndareus. The west portico has
two eagles, and upon them are two Victories. Lysander dedicated them to
commemorate both his exploits; the one was off Ephesos, when he
conquered Antiokhos, the captain of Alcibiades, and the Athenian
warships and the second occurred later, when he destroyed the Athenian
fleet at Aigospotamoi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.5">

On the left of the Lady of the Bronze House they have set up a sanctuary
of the Muses, because the Lacedaemonians used to go out to fight, not to
the sound of the trumpet, but to the music of the flute and the
accompaniment of lyre and harp. Behind the Lady of the Bronze House is a
temple of Aphrodite Areia (Warlike). The wooden images are as old as any
in Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.6">

On the right of the Lady of the Bronze House has been set up an image of
Zeus Most High, the oldest image that is made of bronze. It is not
created in one piece. Each of the limbs has been hammered separately;
these are fitted together, being prevented from coming apart by nails.
They say that the artist was Klearkhos of Rhēgion, who is said by some
to have been a pupil of Dipoinos[^252] and Skyllis, by others of
Daidalos himself. By what is called the Scenoma (Tent) there is a statue
of a woman, whom the Lacedaemonians say is Euryleonis. She won a victory
at Olympia with a two-horse chariot.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.7">

By the side of the altar of the Lady of the Bronze House stand two
statues of Pausanias, the general at Plataea. His history, as it is
known, I will not relate. The accurate accounts of my predecessors
suffice; I shall content myself with adding to them what I heard from a
man of Byzantium. Pausanias was detected in his treachery, and was the
only suppliant of the Lady of the Bronze House who failed to win
security, solely because he had been unable to wipe away a defilement of
bloodshed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.8">

When he was cruising about the Hellespont with the Lacedaemonian and
allied fleets, he fell in love with a Byzantine girl. And straightway at
the beginning of night Kleonike —that was the girl’s name—was brought by
those who had been ordered to do so. But Pausanias was asleep at the
time and the noise awoke him. For as she came to him she unintentionally
dropped her lighted lamp. And Pausanias, conscious of his treason to
Greece, and therefore always nervous and fearful, jumped up then and
struck the girl with his sword.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.17.9">

From this defilement Pausanias could not escape, although he underwent
all sorts of purifications and became a suppliant of Zeus Phyxios (God
of Flight), and finally went to the wizards at Phigalia in Arcadia but
he paid a fitting penalty to Kleonike and to the god. The
Lacedaemonians, in fulfillment of a command from Delphi, had the bronze
images made and honor the spirit Bountiful, saying that it was this
Bountiful that turns aside the wrath that the God of Suppliants shows
because of Pausanias.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.1">

Near the statues of Pausanias is an image of Aphrodite Ambologera
(Postponer of Old Age), which was set up in accordance with an oracle;
there are also images of Sleep and of Death. They think them brothers,
in accordance with the verses in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.2">

As you go towards what is called the Alpium is a temple of Athena
Ophthalmitis (Goddess of the Eye). They say that Lycurgus (Lykourgos)
dedicated it when one of his eyes had been struck out by Alkandros,
because the laws he had made happened not to find favor with Alkandros.
Having fled to this place he was saved by the Lacedaemonians from losing
his remaining eye, and so he made this temple of Athena Ophthalmitis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.3">

Farther on from here is a sanctuary of Ammon. From the first the
Lacedaemonians are known to have used the oracle in Libya more than any
other Greeks. It is said also that when Lysander was besieging Aphytis
in Pallene Ammon appeared by night and declared that it would be better
for him and for Lacedaemon if they ceased from warring against Aphytis.
And so Lysander raised the siege, and induced the Lacedaemonians to
worship the god still more. The people of Aphytis honor Ammon no less
than the Ammonian Libyans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.4">

The story of Artemis Cnagia is as follows. Cnageus, they say, was a
native who joined the Dioskouroi in their expedition against Aphidna.
Being taken prisoner in the battle and sold into Crete, he lived as a
slave where the Cretans had a sanctuary of Artemis; but in course of
time he ran away in the company of the virgin priestess, who took the
image with her. It is for this reason that they name Artemis Cnagia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.5">

But I am of opinion that Cnageus came to Crete in some other way, and
not in the manner the Lacedaemonians state; for I do not think there was
a battle at Aphidna at all, Theseus being detained among the
Thesprotians and the Athenians not being unanimous, their sympathies
inclining towards Menestheus. Moreover, even if a fight occurred, nobody
would believe that prisoners were taken from the conquerors, especially
as the victory was overwhelming, so that Aphidna itself was captured.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.6">

I must now end my criticisms. As you go down to Amyklai from Sparta you
come to a river called Tiasa. They hold that Tiasa was a daughter of
Eurotas, and by it is a sanctuary of Graces, Phaenna and Cleta, as
Alcman calls them in a poem. They believe that Lacedaemon founded the
sanctuary for the Graces here, and gave them their names.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.7">

The things worth seeing in Amyklai include a victor in the
pentathlon,[^253] named Ainetos, on a slab. The story is that he won a
victory at Olympia, but died while the garland was being placed on his
head. So there is the statue of this man; there are also bronze tripods.
The older ones are said to be a tithe of the Messenian war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.8">

Under the first tripod stood an image of Aphrodite, and under the second
an Artemis. The two tripods themselves and the reliefs are the work of
Gitiadas.[^254] The third was made by Gallon of Aegina, and under it
stands an image of the Maiden, daughter of Demeter. Aristandros of Paros
and Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\] of Argos[^255] have statues here; the
former a woman with a lyre, supposed to be Sparta, the latter an
Aphrodite called “beside the Amyklaian.” These tripods are larger than
the others, and were dedicated from the spoils of the victory at
Aigospotamoi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.9">

Bathykles of Magnesia,[^256] who made the throne of the Amyklaian,
dedicated, on the completion of the throne, Graces and an image of
Artemis Leucophryene. Whose pupil this Bathykles was, and who was king
of Lacedaemon when he made the throne, I pass over; but I saw the throne
and will describe its details.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.10">

It is supported in front, and similarly behind, by two Graces and two
Seasons. On the left stand Echidna and Typhos, on the right Tritons. To
describe the reliefs one by one in detail would have merely bored my
readers; but to be brief and concise (for the greater number of them are
not unknown either) Poseidon and Zeus are carrying Taygete, daughter of
Atlas, and her sister Alcyone. There are also reliefs of Atlas, the
single combat of Hēraklēs and Kyknos, and the battle of the Centaurs at
the cave of Pholus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.11">

I cannot say why Bathykles has represented the so-called Bull of Minos
bound, and being led along alive by Theseus. There is also on the throne
a band of Phaeacian dancers, and Demodocus singing. Perseus, too, is
represented killing Medusa. Passing over the fight of Hēraklēs with the
giant Thourios and that of Tyndareus with Eurytos, we have next the
abduction of the daughters of Leukippos. Here are Dionysus, too, and
Hēraklēs; Hermes is bearing the infant Dionysus to the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\], and Athena
is taking Hēraklēs to dwell henceforth with the gods.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.12">

There is Peleus handing over Achilles to be reared by Kheiron, who is
also said to have been his teacher. There is Cephalus, too, carried off
by Day because of his beauty. The gods are bringing gifts to the
marriage of Harmonia. There is created also the single combat of
Achilles and Memnon, and Hēraklēs avenging himself upon Diomedes the
Thracian, and upon Nessus at the river Euenus. Hermes is bringing the
goddesses to Alexander to be judged. Adrastos and Tydeus are staying the
fight between Amphiaraos and Lycurgus (Lykourgos) the son of Pronax.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.13">

Hērā is gazing at Io, the daughter of Inakhos, who is already a cow, and
Athena is running away from Hephaistos, who chases her. Next to these
have been created two of the exploits of Hēraklēs—his slaying the hydra,
and his bringing up the Hound of Hades. Anaxias and Mnasinous are each
seated on horseback, but there is one horse only carrying Megapenthes,
the son of Menelaos, and Nikostratos. Bellerophontes is destroying the
beast in Lycia, and Hēraklēs is driving off the cows of Geryones.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.14">

At the upper edge of the throne are created, one on each side, the sons
of Tyndareus on horses. There are sphinxes under the horses, and beasts
running upwards, on the one side a leopard, by Polydeukes a lioness. On
the very top of the throne has been created a band of dancers, the
Magnesians who helped Bathykles to make the throne.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.15">

Underneath the throne, the inner part away from the Tritons contains the
hunting of the Calydonian boar and Hēraklēs killing the children of
Aktor. Calais and Zetes are driving the Harpies away from Phineus.
Peirithoös and Theseus have seized Helen, and Hēraklēs is strangling the
lion. Apollo and Artemis are shooting Tityus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.18.16">

There is represented the fight between Hēraklēs and Oreios the Centaur,
and also that between Theseus and the Bull of Minos. There are also
represented the wrestling of Hēraklēs with Akhelōos, the fabled binding
of Hērā by Hephaistos, the games Akastos held in honor of his father,
and the story of Menelaos and the Egyptian Proteus from the
Odyssey.[^257] Lastly there is Admetos yoking a boar and a lion to his
chariot, and the Trojans are bringing libations to Hector.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.1">

The part of the throne where the god would sit is not continuous; there
are several seats, and by the side of each seat is left a wide empty
space, the middle, whereon the image stands, being the widest of them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.2">

I know of nobody who has measured the height of the image, but at a
guess one would estimate it to be as much as thirty cubits. It is not
the work of Bathykles, being old and uncouth; for though it has face,
feet, and hands, the rest resembles a bronze pillar. On its head it has
a helmet, in its hands a spear and a bow.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.3">

The pedestal of the statue is fashioned into the shape of an altar and
they say that Hyakinthos is buried in it, and at the Hyakinthia, before
the sacrifice to Apollo, they devote offerings to Hyakinthos as to a
hero into this altar through a bronze door, which is on the left of the
altar. On the altar are made-in-relief, here an image of Biris, there
Amphitrite and Poseidon. Zeus and Hermes are conversing; near stand
Dionysus and Semele, with Ino by her side.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.4">

On the altar are also Demeter, the Maiden, Pluto \[Ploutōn\], next to
them Fates and Seasons, and with them Aphrodite, Athena and Artemis.
They are carrying to the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] Hyakinthos
and Polyboia, the sister, they say, of Hyakinthos, who died a virgin
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\]. Now this
statue of Hyakinthos represents him as bearded, but Nikias,[^258] son of
Nikomedes, has painted him in the very prime of youthful beauty, hinting
at the storied
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legomenos</span>\]
passionate-love \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\]
of Apollo for Hyakinthos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.5">

Crafted on the altar is also Hēraklēs; he too is being led to the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] by Athena and
the other gods. On the altar are also the daughters of Thestios, Muses
and Seasons. As for the West Wind, how Apollo unintentionally killed
Hyakinthos, and the things that have been told about the flower, we must
be content with how it is told, although perhaps it could have been
otherwise.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.6">

Amyklai was laid waste by the Dorians, and since that time has remained
a village; I found there a sanctuary and image of Alexandra worth
seeing. Alexandra is said by the Amyklaians to be Cassandra, the
daughter of Priam. Here is also a statue of Clytaemnestra, together with
what is supposed to be the tomb of Agamemnon. The natives worship the
Amyklaian god and Dionysus, surnaming the latter, quite correctly I
think, Psilax. For psila is Doric for wings, and wine uplifts men and
lightens their spirit no less than wings do birds.

</div>

Such I found were the things worth mentioning about Amyklai. Another
road from the city leads to Therapne,

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.7">

and on this road is a wooden image of Athena Aléā. Before the Eurotas is
crossed, a little above the bank is shown a sanctuary of Zeus Wealthy.
Across the river is a temple of Asklepios Cotyleus (of the Hip-joint);
it was made by Hēraklēs, who named Asklepios Cotyleus, because he was
cured of the wound in the hip-joint that he received in the former fight
with Hippokoön and his sons. Of all the objects along this road the
oldest is a sanctuary of Ares. This is on the left of the road, and the
image is said to have been brought from Kolkhis by the Dioskouroi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.8">

They surname him Theritas after Thero, who is said to have been the
nurse of Ares. Perhaps it was from the people of Kolkhis that they heard
the name Theritas, since the Greeks know of no Thero, nurse of Ares. My
own belief is that the surname Theritas[^259] was not given to Ares
because of his nurse, but because when a man meets an enemy in battle he
must cast aside all gentleness, as Homer says of Achilles:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“And he is fierce as a lion.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 24.41

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.9">

The name of Therapne is derived from the daughter of Lelex, and in it is
a temple of Menelaos; they say that Menelaos and Helen were buried here.
The account of the Rhodians is different. They say that when Menelaos
was dead, and Orestes still a wanderer, Helen was driven out by
Nikostratos and Megapenthes and came to Rhodes, where she had a friend
in Polyxo,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.10">

the wife of Tlepolemos. For Polyxo, they say, was an Argive by descent,
and when she was already married to Tlepolemos shared his flight to
Rhodes. At the time she was queen of the island, having been left with
an orphan boy. They say that this Polyxo desired to avenge the death of
Tlepolemos on Helen, now that she had her in her power. So she sent
against her when she was bathing handmaidens dressed up as Furies, who
seized Helen and hanged her on a tree, and for this reason the Rhodians
have a sanctuary of Helen of the Tree.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.11">

A story too I will tell which I know the people of Kroton tell about
Helen. The people of Himera too agree with this account. In the Euxine
at the mouths of the Ister is an island sacred to Achilles. It is called
White Island, and its circumference is twenty stadium-lengths. It is
wooded throughout and abounds in animals, wild and tame, while on it is
a temple of Achilles with an image of him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.12">

The first to sail there, it is said, was Leonymus of Kroton. For when
war had arisen between the people of Kroton and the people of Lokris \[=
Lokroi\] in Italy, the people of Lokris, in virtue of the relationship
between them and the Opuntians, called upon Ajax son of Oileus to help
them in battle. So Leonymus the general of the people of Kroton attacked
his enemy at that point where he heard that Ajax was posted in the front
line. Now he was wounded in the breast, and weak with his hurt came to
Delphi. When he arrived the Pythian priestess sent Leonynios to White
Island, telling him that there Ajax would appear to him and cure his
wound.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.19.13">

In time he was healed and returned from White Island, where, he used to
declare, he saw Achilles, as well as Ajax the son of Oileus and Ajax the
son of Telamon. With them, he said, were Patroklos and Antilokhos; Helen
was wedded to Achilles, and had bidden him sail to Stesichorus at
Himera, and announce that the loss of his sight was caused by her wrath.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.1">

Therefore Stesichorus composed his recantation. In Therapne I remember
seeing the fountain Messeis. Some of the Lacedaemonians, however, have
declared that of old the name Messeis was given, not to the fountain at
Therapne, but to the one we call Polydeucea. The fountain Polydeucea and
a sanctuary of Polydeukes are on the right of the road to Therapne.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.2">

Not far from Therapne is what is called Phoebaeum, in which is a temple
of the Dioskouroi. Here the youths sacrifice to Enyalios. At no great
distance from it stands a sanctuary of Poseidon surnamed Earth-embracer.
Going on from here in the direction of Taygetos you come to a place
called Alesiai(Place of Grinding) they say that Myles (Mill-man) the son
of Lelex was the first human being to invent a mill, and that he ground
wheat in this Alesiae. Here they have a hero-shrine of Lacedaemon, the
son of Taygete.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.3">

Crossing from here a river Phellia, and going past Amyklai along a road
leading straight towards the sea, you come to the site of Pharis, which
was once a city of Laconia. Turning away from the Phellia to the right
is the road that leads to Mount Taygetos. On the plain is a precinct of
Zeus Messapeus, who is surnamed, they say, after a man who served the
god as his priest. Leaving Taygetos from here you come to the site of
the city Bryseae. There still remains here a temple of Dionysus with an
image in the open. But the image in the temple women only may see, for
women by themselves perform in secret the sacrificial rites.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.4">

Above Bryseai rises Taletum, a peak of Taygetos. They call it sacred to
Hēlios (the Sun), and among the sacrifices they offer here to Hēlios are
horses. I am aware that the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] also are
accustomed to offer the same sacrifice. Not far from Taletum is a place
called Euoras, the haunt of wild animals, especially wild goats. In fact
all Taygetos is a hunting-ground for these goats and for boars, and it
is well stocked with both deer and bears.

Between Taletum and Euoras is a place they name Therai, where they say
Leto from the Peaks of Taygetos … is a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed
Eleusinian. Here according to the Lacedaemonian story Hēraklēs was
hidden by Asklepios while he was being healed of a wound. In the
sanctuary is a wooden image of Orpheus, a work, they say, of Pelasgians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.6">

I know also of the following rite which is performed here. By the sea
was a city Helos, which Homer too has mentioned in his list of the
Lacedaemonians:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“These had their home in Amyklai, and in Helos the town by the seaside.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 2.584

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

It was founded by Helios
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hĕlios</span> not
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Hēlios</span>\], the youngest of
the sons of Perseus, and the Dorians afterwards reduced it by siege. Its
inhabitants became the first slaves of the Lacedaemonian state, and were
the first to be called Helots
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heilōtes</span>\], as in fact
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heilōtes</span>they were. The
slaves afterwards acquired, although they were Dorians of Messenia, also
came to be called Helots, just as the entire lineage of people who were
called Hellēnes \[‘Greeks’\] were named after the region in Thessaly
once called Hellas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.7">

From this Helos, on stated days, they bring up to the sanctuary of the
Eleusinian a wooden image of the Maiden, daughter of Demeter. Fifteen
stadium-lengths distant from the sanctuary is Lapithaion, named after
Lapithos, a native of the district. So this Lapithaion is on Taygetos,
and not far off is Dereium, where is in the open an image of Artemis
Dereatis, and beside it is a spring which they name Anonus. About twenty
stadium-lengths past Dereum is Harpleia, which extends as far as the
plain.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.8">

On the road from Sparta to Arcadia there stands in the open an image of
Athena surnamed Pareia, and after it is a sanctuary of Achilles. This it
is not customary to open, but all the youths who are going to take part
in the contest in Plane tree Grove are accustomed to sacrifice to
Achilles before the fight. The Spartans say that the sanctuary was made
for them by Prax, a grandson of Pergamos the son of Neoptolemos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.9">

Further on is what is called the Tomb of Horse. For Tyndareus, having
sacrificed a horse here, administered an oath to the suitors of Helen,
making them stand upon the pieces of the horse. The oath was to defend
Helen and him who might be chosen to marry her if ever they should be
wronged. When he had sworn the suitors he buried the horse here. Seven
pillars, which are not far from this tomb … in the ancient manner, I
believe, which they say are images of the planets. On the road is a
precinct of Cranius surnamed Stemmatias, and a sanctuary of Mysian
Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.10">

The image of Modesty, some thirty stadium-lengths distant from the city,
they say was dedicated by Icarius, the following being the reason for
making it. When Icarius gave Penelope in marriage to Odysseus, he tried
to make Odysseus himself settle in Lacedaemon, but failing in the
attempt, he next besought his daughter to remain behind, and when she
was setting forth to Ithaca he followed the chariot, begging her to
stay.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.20.11">

Odysseus endured it for a time, but at last he ordered Penelope either
to accompany him willingly, or else, if she preferred her father, to go
back to Lacedaemon. They say that she made no reply, but covered her
face with a veil in reply to the question, so that Icarios, realizing
that she wished to depart with Odysseus, let her go, and dedicated an
image of Modesty; for Penelope, they say, had reached this point of the
road when she veiled herself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.1">

Twenty stadium-lengths from here the stream of the Eurotas comes very
near to the road, and here is the tomb of Ladas, the fastest runner of
his day. He was garlanded at Olympia for a victory in the long race, and
falling ill, I take it, immediately after the victory he was on his way
home; his death took place here, and his tomb is above the highway. His
namesake, who also won at Olympia a victory, not in the long race but in
the short race, is stated in the records of the people of Elis
concerning Olympic victors to have been a native of Aigion in Achaea.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.2">

Farther On in the direction of Pellana is what is called Kharkoma
(Trench); and after it Pellana, which in the olden time was a city. They
say that Tyndareus dwelled here when he fled from Sparta before
Hippokoön and his sons. Remarkable sights I remember seeing here were a
sanctuary of Asklepios and the spring Pellanis. Into it they say a girl
fell when she was drawing water, and when she had disappeared the veil
on her head reappeared in another spring, Lancia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.3">

A hundred stadium-lengths away from Pellana is The place called
Belemina. It is naturally The best watered region of Laconia, seeing
that The river Eurotas passes through it, while it has abundant springs
of its own.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.4">

As you go down to the sea towards Gythium you come to a village called
Croceae and a quarry. It is not a continuous stretch of rock, but the
stones they dig out are shaped like river pebbles; they are hard to
work, but when worked sanctuaries of the gods might be adorned with
them, while they are especially adapted for beautifying swimming-baths
and fountains. Here before the village stands an image of Zeus of
Croceae in marble, and the Dioskouroi in bronze are at the quarry.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.5">

After Croceae, turning away to the right from the straight road to
Gythium, you will reach a city Aegiae. They say that this is the city
which Homer[^260] in his poem calls Augeae. Here is a lake called
Poseidon’s, and by the lake is a temple with an image of the god. They
are afraid to take out the fish, saying that a fisherman in these waters
turns into the fish called the fisher.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.6">

Gythium is thirty stadium-lengths distant from Aigiai, built by the sea
in the territory of the Free Laconians, whom the emperor Augustus freed
from the bondage in which they had been to the Lacedaemonians in Sparta.
All the Peloponnesus, except the Isthmus of Corinth, is surrounded by
sea, but the best shell-fish for the manufacture of purple dye after
those of the Phoenician sea are to be found on the coast of Laconia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.7">

The Free Laconians have eighteen cities; the first as you go down from
Aigiai to the sea is Gythium; after it come Teuthrone and Las and
Pyrrhikos; on Taenarum are Caenepolis, Oetylus, Leuktra and Thalamae,
and in addition Alagoma and Gerenia. On the other side of Clythium by
the sea are Asopos, Acriae, Boeae, Larax, Epidaurus Limera, Brasiae,
Geronthraiand Marius. These are all that are left to the Free Laconians
out of twenty-four cities which once were theirs. All the other cities
with which my narrative will deal belong, it must be remembered, to
Sparta, and are not independent like those I have already mentioned.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.8">

The people of Cythium say that their city had no human founder, but that
Hēraklēs and Apollo, when they were reconciled after their strife for
the possession of the tripod, united to found the city. In the
marketplace they have images of Apollo and of Hēraklēs, and a Dionysus
stands near them. In another part of the city are Carnean Apollo, a
sanctuary of Ammon and a bronze image of Asklepios, whose temple is
roofless, a spring belonging to the god, a holy sanctuary of Demeter and
an image of Poseidon Earth-embracer.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.21.9">

Him whom the people of Cythium name Old Man, saying that he lives in the
sea, I found to be Nereus. They got this name originally from Homer, who
says in a part of the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>,
where Thetis is speaking:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Into the broad expanse, and into the bosom of ocean

Here is also a gate called the Gate of Castor (Kastor), and on the
citadel have been built a temple and image of Athena.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.1">

Just about three stadium-lengths from Gythium is an unfinished stone. It
is said that when Orestes sat down upon it his madness left him. For
this reason the stone was named in the Dorian tongue Zeus Cappotas.
Before Gythium lies the island Cranae, and Homer[^261] says that when
Alexander had carried off Helen he had intercourse with her there for
the first time. On the mainland opposite the island is a sanctuary of
Aphrodite Migonitis (Union), and the whole place is called Migonium.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.2">

This sanctuary, they say, was made by Alexander. But when Menelaos had
taken Ilion and had returned safe home eight years after the sack of
Troy, he set up near the sanctuary of Migonitis an image of Thetis and
the goddesses Praxidikai (Exacters of Justice). Above Migonium is a
mountain called Larysiumi sacred to Dionysus, and at the beginning of
spring they hold a festival in honor of Dionysus, and among the things
they say about the ritual is that they find here a ripe bunch of grapes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.3">

Some thirty stadium-lengths beyond Gythium on the left there are on the
mainland walls of a place called Trinasus (Three Islands), which was in
my opinion a fort and not a city. Its name I think is derived from the
islets which lie off the coast here, three in number. About eighty
stadium-lengths beyond Trinasus I came to the ruins o Af Helos,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.4">

and some thirty stadium-lengths farther is Acriae, a city on the coast.
Well worth seeing here are a temple and marble image of the Mother of
the Gods. The people of Acriae say that this is the oldest sanctuary of
this goddess in the Peloponnesus, although the Magnesians, who live to
the north of Mount Sipylos, have on the rock Koddinos the most ancient
of all the images of the Mother of the gods. The Magnesians say that it
was made by Broteas the son of Tantalos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.5">

The people of Acriae once produced an Olympian victor, Nikokles, who at
two Olympian festivals carried off five prizes for running. There has
been raised to him a monument between the gymnasium and the wall by the
harbor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.6">

A hundred and twenty stadium-lengths inland from Acriae is Geronthrae.
It was inhabited before the Herakleidai came to Peloponnesus, but the
Dorians of Lacedaemon expelled the Achaean inhabitants and afterwards
sent to it settlers of their own; but in my time it belonged to the Free
Laconians. On the road from Acriae to Geronthraiis a village called
Palaia (Old), and in Geronthraiitself are a temple and grove of Ares.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.7">

Every year they hold a festival in honor of the God, at which women are
forbidden to enter the grove. Around the marketplace are their springs
of drinking-water. On the citadel is a temple of Apollo with the head of
an ivory image. The rest of the image was destroyed by fire along with
the former temple.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.8">

Marius is another town of the Free Laconians, distant from Geronthraione
hundred stadium-lengths. Here is an ancient sanctuary common to all the
gods, and around it is a grove containing springs. In a sanctuary of
Artemis also there are springs. In fact Marius has an unsurpassed supply
of water. Above the town, and like it in the interior, is a village,
Glyppia. From Geronthraito another village, Selinous, is a journey of
twenty stadium-lengths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.9">

These places are inland from Acriae. By the sea is a city Asopos, sixty
stadium-lengths distant from Acriae. In it is a temple of the Roman
emperors, and about twelve stadium-lengths inland from the city is a
sanctuary of Asklepios. They call the god Philolaos, and the bones in
the gymnasium, which they worship, are human, although of superhuman
size. On the citadel is also a sanctuary of Athena, surnamed Cyparissia
(Cypress Goddess). At the foot of the citadel are the ruins of a city
called the City of the Paracyparissian[^262] Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.10">

There is also in this district a sanctuary of Asklepios, about fifty
stadium-lengths from Asopos the place where the sanctuary is they name
Hyperteleatum. Two hundred stadium-lengths from Asopos there juts out
into the sea a headland, which they call Onugnathus (Jaw of an Ass).
Here is a sanctuary of Athena, having neither image nor roof. Agamemnon
is said to have made it. There is also the tomb of Cinadus, one of the
pilots of the ship of Menelaos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.11">

After the peak there runs into the land the Gulf of Boeae, and the city
of Boeae is at the head of the gulf. This was founded by Boeus, one of
the Herakleidai, and he is said to have collected inhabitants for it
from three cities, Etis, Aphrodisias and Side. Of the ancient cities two
are said to have been founded by Aeneas when he was fleeing to Italy and
had been driven into this gulf by storms. Etias, they allege, was a
daughter of Aeneas. The third city they say was named after Side,
daughter of Danaos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.12">

When the inhabitants of these cities were expelled, they were anxious to
know where they ought to settle, and an oracle was given them that
Artemis would show them where they were to dwell. When therefore they
had gone on shore, and a hare appeared to them, they looked upon the
hare as their guide on the way. When it dived into a myrtle-bush
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mursinē</span>\], they built a
city where the myrtle-bush
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mursinē</span>\] was, and down
to this day they worship
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sebein</span>\] that
myrtle-bush as the Tree \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò
dendron</span>\].[^263] As for the name they give to Artemis, it is
Savior \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sōteira</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.22.13">

In the marketplace of Boeae is a temple of Apollo, and in another part
of the town are temples of Asklepios, of Serapis, and of Isis. The ruins
of Etis are not more than seven stadium-lengths distant from Boeae. On
the way to them there stands on the left a stone image of Hermes. Among
the ruins is a not insignificant sanctuary of Asklepios and Hygieia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.1">

Cythera lies opposite Boeae; to the promontory of Platanistos, the point
where the island lies nearest to the mainland, it is a voyage of forty
stadium-lengths from a promontory on the mainland called Onugnathus. In
Cythera is a port Scandeia on the coast, but the town Cythera is about
ten stadium-lengths inland from Scandeia. The sanctuary of Aphrodite the
celestial one \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ourania</span>\]
is most holy, and it is the most ancient of all the sanctuaries of
Aphrodite among the Greeks. The goddess herself is represented by an
armed image of wood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.2">

On the voyage from Boeae towards the point of Malea is a harbor called
Nymphaeum, with a statue of Poseidon standing, and a cave close to the
sea; in it is a spring of sweet water. There is a large population in
the district. After doubling the point of Malea and proceeding a hundred
stadium-lengths, you reach a place on the coast within the frontier of
the Boeatae, which is sacred to Apollo and called Epidelium.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.3">

For the wooden image which is now here, once stood in Delos. Delos was
then a Greek market, and seemed to offer security to traders on account
of the god; but as the place was unfortified and the inhabitants
unarmed, Menophanes, an officer of Mithridates, attacked it with a
fleet, to show his contempt for the god, or acting on the orders of
Mithridates; for to a man whose object is gain what is sacred is of less
account than what is profitable.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.4">

This Menophanes put to death the foreigners
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenoi</span>\] residing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epidēmein</span>\] there and
the Delians themselves, and after plundering much property belonging to
the traders and all the offerings, and also carrying women and children
away as slaves, he razed Delos itself to the ground. As it was being
sacked and pillaged, one of the barbarians wantonly flung this image
into the sea; but the wave took it and brought it to land here in the
country of the Boeatae. For this reason they call the place Epidelium.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.5">

But neither Menophanes nor Mithridates himself escaped the wrath of the
god. Menophanes, as he was putting to sea after the sack of Delos was
sunk at once by those of the merchants who had escaped; for they lay in
wait for him in ships. The god caused Mithridates at a later date to lay
hands upon himself, when his empire had been destroyed and he himself
was being hunted on all sides by the Romans. There are some who say that
he obtained a violent death as a favor at the hands of one of his
mercenaries. This was the reward of their impiety.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.6">

The country of the Boeatae is adjoined by Epidaurus Limera, distant some
two hundred stadium-lengths from Epidelium. The people say that they are
not descended from the Lacedaemonians but from the Epidaurians of the
Argolid, and that they touched at this point in Laconia when sailing on
public business to Asklepios in Kos. Warned by dreams that appeared to
them, they remained and settled here.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.7">

They also say that a snake, which they were bringing from their home in
Epidaurus, escaped from the ship, and disappeared into the ground not
far from the sea. As a result of the portent of the snake together with
the vision in their dreams they resolved to remain and settle here.
There are altars to Asklepios where the snake disappeared, with olive
trees growing round them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.8">

About two stadium-lengths to the right is the water of Ino, as it is
called, in extent like a small lake, but going deeper into the earth.
Into this water they throw cakes of barley meal at the festival of Ino.
If good luck is portended to the thrower, the water keeps them under.
But if it brings them to the surface, it is judged a bad sign.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.9">

The craters in Aetna have the same feature; for they lower into them
objects of gold and silver and also all kinds of victims. If the fire
receives and consumes them, they rejoice at the appearance of a good
sign, but if it casts up what has been thrown in, they think misfortune
will befall the man to whom this happens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.10">

By the road leading from Boeae to Epidaurus Limera is a sanctuary of
Artemis Limnatis (Of the Lake) in the country of the Epidaurians. The
city lies on high ground, not far from the sea. Here the sanctuary of
Artemis is worth seeing, also that of Asklepios with a standing statue
of stone, a temple of Athena on the acropolis, and of Zeus with the
title Savior in front of the harbor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.23.11">

A promontory called Minoa projects into the sea near[^264] the town. The
bay has nothing to distinguish it from all the other inlets of the sea
in Laconia, but the beach here contains pebbles of prettier form and of
all colors.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.1">

A hundred stadium-lengths from Epidaurus is Zarax; though possessing a
good harbor, it is the most ruinous of the towns of the Free Laconians,
since it was the only town of theirs to be depopulated by Kleonymos the
son of Kleomenes, son of Agesipolis. I have told the story of Kleomenes
elsewhere.[^265] There is nothing in Zarax except a temple of Apollo,
with a statue holding a lyre, at the head of the harbor.[^266]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.2">

The road from Zarax follows the coast for about a hundred
stadium-lengths, and there strikes inland. After an ascent of ten
stadium-lengths inland are the ruins of the so-called Cyphanta, among
which is a cave sacred to Asklepios; the image is of stone. There is a
fountain of cold water springing from the rock, where they say that
Atalanta, distressed by thirst when hunting, struck the rock with her
spear, so that the water gushed forth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.3">

Brasiaiis the last town on the coast belonging to the Free Laconians in
this direction. It is distant two hundred stadium-lengths by sea from
Cyphanta. The inhabitants have a story, found nowhere else in Greece,
that Semele, after giving birth to her son by Zeus, was discovered by
Kadmos and put with Dionysus into a chest, which was washed up by the
waves in their country. Semele, who was no longer alive when found,
received a splendid funeral, but they brought up Dionysus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.4">

For this reason the name of their city, hitherto called Oreiatae, was
changed to Brasiaiafter the washing up of the chest to land; so too in
our time the common word used of the waves casting things ashore is
ekbrazein. The people of Brasiaiadd that Ino in the course of her
wanderings came to the country, and agreed to become the nurse of
Dionysus. They show the cave where Ino nursed him, and call the plain
the garden of Dionysus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.5">

The temples here are those of Asklepios and of Achilles, in whose honor
they hold an annual festival. There is a small promontory at Brasiae,
which projects gently into the sea; on it stand bronze figures, not more
than a foot high, with caps on their heads. I am not sure whether they
consider them to be Dioskouroi or Corybants. They are three in number; a
statue of Athena makes a fourth.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.6">

To the right of Gythium is Las, ten stadium-lengths from the sea and
forty from Gythium. The site of the present town extends over the ground
between the mountains called Ilios, Asia and Cnacadium; formerly it lay
on the summit of Mount Asia. Even now there are ruins of the old town,
with a statue of Hēraklēs outside the walls, and a trophy for a victory
over the Macedonians. These formed a detachment of Philip’s army, when
he invaded Laconia, but were separated from the main body and were
plundering the coastal districts.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.7">

Among the ruins is a temple of Athena named Asia, made, it is said, by
Polydeukes and Castor (Kastor) on their return home from Kolkhis; for
the people of Kolkhis had a shrine of Athena Asia. I know that the sons
of Tyndareus took part in Jason’s expedition. As to the people of
Kolkhis honoring Athena Asia, I give what I heard from the
Lacedaemonians. Near the present town is a spring called Galaco (Milky)
from the color of the water, and beside the spring a gymnasium, which
contains an ancient statue of Hermes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.8">

On Mount Ilios is a temple of Dionysus, and of Asklepios at the very

the left of the promontory; its water is extremely sweet to drink; its
sources are in Mount Taygetos, and it passes within five stadium-lengths
of the town.

At a spot called Arainos is the tomb of Las with a statue upon it. The
natives say that Las was their founder and was killed by Achilles, and
that Achilles put in to their country to ask the hand of Helen of
Tyndareus. In point of fact it was Patroklos who killed Las, for it was
he who was Helen’s suitor. We need not regard it as a proof that
Achilles did not ask for Helen because he is not mentioned in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Catalogue of Women</span> as one of
her suitors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.24.11">

But at the beginning of his poem Homer says that Achilles came to Troy
as a favor to the sons of Atreus,[^267] and not because he was bound by
the oaths which Tyndareus exacted; and in the Games he makes Antilokhos
say that Odysseus was a generation older than he,[^268] whereas
Odysseus, telling Alkinoos of his descent to Hades and other adventures,
said that he wished to see Theseus and Peirithoös, men of an earlier
age.[^269] We know that Theseus carried off Helen, so that it is quite
impossible that Achilles could have been her suitor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.1">

Beyond the tomb a river named Scyras enters the sea. Formerly it was
without a name, but was so called, because Pyrrhos the son of Achilles
put in here when he sailed from Scyros to wed Hermione. Across the river
is an ancient shrine … further from an altar of Zeus. Inland, forty
stadium-lengths from the river, lies Pyrrhikos, the name of which is
said to be derived from Pyrrhos the son of Achilles;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.2">

but according to another account Pyrrhikos was one of the gods called
Kouretes. Others say that Silenus came from Malea and settled here. That
Silenus was brought up in Malea is clear from these words in an ode of
Pindar:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“The mighty one, the dancer, whom the mount of Malea nurtured, husband
of Nais, Silenus.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Pindar Frag. 156 (Schröder)

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Not that Pindar said his name was Pyrrhikos; that is a statement of the
men of Malea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.3">

At Pyrrhikos there is a well in the marketplace, considered to be the
gift of Silenus. If this were to fail, they would be short of water. The
sanctuaries of the gods, that they have in the country, are of Artemis,
called Astrateia, because the Amazons stayed their advance (strateia)
here, and an Apollo Amazonios. Both gods are represented by wooden
images, said to have been dedicated by the women from Thermodon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.4">

From Pyrrhikos the road comes down to the sea at Teuthrone. The
inhabitants declare that their founder was Teuthras, an Athenian. They
honor Artemis Issoria most of the Gods, and have a spring Naia. The
promontory of Taenarum projects into the sea 150 stadium-lengths from
Teuthrone, with the harbors Achilleios and Psamathus. On the promontory
is a temple like a cave, with a statue of Poseidon in front of it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.5">

Some of the Greek poets state that Hēraklēs brought up the hound of
Hades here, though there is no road that leads underground through the
cave, and it is not easy to believe that the gods possess any
underground dwelling where the souls collect. But Hecataeus of Miletus
gave a plausible explanation, stating that a terrible serpent lived on
Taenarum, and was called the hound of Hades, because any one bitten was
bound to die of the poison at once, and it was this snake, he said, that
was brought by Hēraklēs to Eurystheus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.6">

</div>

But Homer, who was the first to refer to it as the hound of
Hādēs—whatever it was that had been brought \[for display\] by
Hēraklēs[^270]—did not give it any name, nor did he figure it into any
\[specific\] form as he did in the case of the Chimaera.[^271] Those who
came later \[than Homer\] made\[-in-their-poetry\]
\[<span custom-style="Emphasis">poieîn</span>\] the name Cerberus
\[Kerberos\], and, though in other respects they made him look like a
hound, they say that he had three heads. Homer, nevertheless, does not
imply that it was a hound domesticated by humanity, any more than if he
had called a real serpent the hound of Hādēs.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.7">

Among other offerings on Taenarum is a bronze statue of Arion the harper
on a dolphin. Herodotus has told the story of Arion and the dolphin, as
he heard it, in his history of Lydia.[^272] I have seen the dolphin at
Poroselene that rewards the boy for saving his life. It had been damaged
by fishermen and he cured it.I saw this dolphin obeying his call and
carrying him whenever he wanted to ride on it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.8">

There is a spring also on Taenarum but now it possesses nothing
marvelous. Formerly, as they say, it showed harbors and ships to those
who looked into the water. These sights in the water were brought to an
end for good and all by a woman washing dirty clothes in it.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.9">

From the point of Taenarum Caenepolis is distant forty stadium-lengths
by sea. Its name also was formerly Taenarum. In it is a hall of Demeter,
and a temple of Aphrodite on the shore, with a standing statue of stone.
Thirty stadium-lengths distant is Thyrides, a headland of Taenarum, with
the ruins of a city Hippola; among them is a sanctuary of Athena
Hippolaitis. A little further are the town and harbor of Messa.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.25.10">

From this harbor it is 150 stadium-lengths to Oetylus. The hero, from
whom the city received its name, was an Argive by descent, son of
Amphianax, the son of Antimakhos. In Oetylus the sanctuary of Sarapis,
and in the marketplace a wooden image of Apollo Karneios are worth
seeing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.1">

From Oetylus to Thalamaithe road is about eighty stadium-lengths long.
On it is a sanctuary of Ino and an oracle. They consult the oracle in
sleep, and the goddess reveals whatever they wish to learn, in dreams.
Bronze statues of Pasiphae and of Hēlios stand in the unroofed part of
the sanctuary. It was not possible to see the one within the temple
clearly, owing to the garlands, but they say this too is of bronze.
Water, sweet to drink, flows from a sacred spring. Pasiphae is a title
of the Moon, and is not a local goddess of the people of Thalamae.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.2">

Twenty stadium-lengths from Thalamaiis a place called Pephnus on the
coast. In front of it lies a small island no larger than a big rock,
also called Pephnus. The people of Thalamaisay that the Dioskouroi were
born here. I know that Alcman too says this in a song: but they do not
say that they remained to be brought up in Pephnus, but that it was
Hermes who took them to Pellana.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.3">

In this little island there are bronze statues of the Dioskouroi, a foot
high, in the open air. The sea will not move them, though in winter-time
it washes over the rock, which is wonderful. Also the ants here have a
whiter color than is usual. The Messenians say that this district was
originally theirs, and so they think that the Dioskouroi belong to them
rather than to the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.4">

Twenty stadium-lengths from Pephnus is Leuktra. I do not know why the
city has this name. If indeed it is derived from Leukippos the son of
Perieres, as the Messenians say, it is for this reason, I think, that
the inhabitants honor Asklepios most of the gods, supposing him to be
the son of Arsinoe the daughter of Leukippos. There is a stone statue of
Asklepios, and of Ino in another place.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.5">

Also a temple and statue have been erected to Cassandra the daughter of
Priam, called Alexandra by the natives. There are wooden images of
Apollo Karneios according to the same custom that prevails among the
Lacedaemonians of Sparta. On the acropolis is a sanctuary and image of
Athena, and there is a temple and grove of Eros in Leuktra. Water flows
through the grove in winter-time, but the leaves which are shaken from
the trees by the wind would not be carried away by the water even in
flood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.6">

I record an event which I know to have taken place in my time on the
coast of Leuktra. A fire carried by the wind into a wood destroyed most
of the trees, and when the place showed bare, a statue of Zeus of Ithome
was found to have been dedicated there. The Messenians say that this is
evidence that Leuktra was formerly a part of Messenia. But it is
possible, if the Lacedaemonians originally lived in Leuktra, that Zeus
of Ithome might be worshipped among them.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.7">

Cardamyle, which is mentioned by Homer in the Gifts promised by
Agamemnon,[^273] is subject to the Lacedaemonians of Sparta, having been
separated from Messenia by the emperor Augustus. It is eight
stadium-lengths from the sea and sixty from Leuktra. Here not far from
the beach is a precinct sacred to the daughters of Nereus. They say that
they came up from the sea to this spot to see Pyrrhos the son of
Achilles, when he was going to Sparta to wed Hermione. In the town is a
sanctuary of Athena, and an Apollo Karneios according to the local
Dorian custom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.8">

A city, called in Homer’s poems Enope,[^274] with Messenian inhabitants
but belonging to the league of the Free Laconians, is called in our time
Gerenia. One account states that Nestor was brought up in this city,
another that he took refuge here, when Pylos was captured by Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.9">

Here in Gerenia is a tomb of Makhaon, son of Asklepios, and a holy
sanctuary. In his temple men may find cures for diseases. They call the
holy spot Rhodos; there is a standing bronze statue of Makhaon, with a
garland on his head which the Messenians in the local speech call
kiphos. The author of the epic <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">The
Little Iliad</span> says that Machaon was killed by Eurypylos, son of
Telephus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.10">

I myself know that to be the reason of the practice at the temple of
Asklepios at Pergamon, where they begin their hymns with Telephus but
make no reference to Eurypylos, or care to mention his name in the
temple at all, as they know that he was the slayer of Makhaon. It is
said that the bones of Makhaon were brought home by Nestor, but that
Podaleirios, as they were returning after the sack of Troy, was carried
out of his course and reached Syrnus on the Carian mainland in safety
and settled there.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:3.26.11">

In the territory of Gerenia is a mountain, Calathium; on it is a
sanctuary of Claea with a cave close beside it; it has a narrow
entrance, but contains objects which are worth seeing. Thirty
stadium-lengths inland from Gerenia is Alagonia, a town which I have
already mentioned in the list of the Free Laconians. Worth seeing here
are temples of Dionysus and of Artemis.

## Scroll IV. Messenia

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.1">

The frontier between Messenia and that part of it which was incorporated
by the emperor in Laconia towards Gerenia is formed in our time by the
valley called Choerius. They say that this country, being unoccupied,
received its first inhabitants in the following manner: On the death of
Lelex, who ruled in the present Laconia, then called after him Lelegia,
Myles, the elder of his sons, received the kingdom. Polycaon was the
younger and for this reason a private person, until he took to wife
Messene, the daughter of Triopas, son of Phorbas, from Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.2">

Messene, being proud of her origin, for her father was the chief of the
Greeks of his day in reputation and power, was not content that her
husband should be a private person. They collected a force from Argos
and from Lacedaemon and came to this country, the whole land receiving
the name Messene from the wife of Polycaon. Together with other cities,
they founded Andania, where their palace was built.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.3">

Before the battle which the Thebans fought with the Lacedaemonians at
Leuktra, and the foundation of the present city of Messene under Ithome,
I think that no city had the name Messene. I base this conclusion
principally on Homer’s lines.[^275] In the catalogue of those who came
to Troy he enumerated Pylos, Arene and other towns, but called no town
Messene. In the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> he
shows that the Messenians were a tribe and not a city by the following:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“For Messenian men carried away sheep from Ithaca.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> xxi 18

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.4">

He is still more clear when speaking about the bow of Iphitos:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“They met one another in Messene

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

in the dwelling of Ortilokhos.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> xxi 15

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

By the dwelling of Ortilokhos he meant the city of Pherai in Messene,
and explained this himself in the visit of Peisistratos to Menelaos:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“They came to Pherai to the house of Diocleus,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

son of Ortilokhos.”

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 3.488

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.5">

The first rulers then in this country were Polycaon, the son of Lelex,
and Messene his wife. It was to her that Kaukon, the son of Kelainos,
son of Phlyοs, brought the rites of the Great Goddesses from Eleusis.
Phlyus himself is said by the Athenians to have been the son of Earth,
and the hymn of Musaeus to Demeter made for the Lykomidai agrees.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.6">

But the mysteries of the Great Goddesses were raised to greater honor
many years later than Kaukon by Lykos, the son of Pandion, an oak-wood,
where he purified the celebrants, being still called the wood of Lykos.
That there is a wood in this land so called is stated by Rhianus the
Cretan:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“By rugged Elaeum above the wood of Lykos.”[^276]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.7">

That this Lykos was the son of Pandion is made clear by the lines on the
statue of Methapus, who made certain improvements in the mysteries.
Methapus was an Athenian by birth, an expert in the mysteries and
founder of all kinds of rites. It was he who established the mysteries
of the Cabiri at Thebes, and dedicated in the hut of the Lykomidai a
statue with an inscription that amongst other things helps to confirm my
account:

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.8">

“I sanctified houses of Hermes and paths of holy Demeter and Kore her
firstborn, where they say that Messene established the feast of the
Great Goddesses, taught by Kaukon, sprung from Phlyus’ noble son. And I
wondered that Lykos, son of Pandion, brought all the Attic rite to wise
Andania.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.1.9">

This inscription shows that Kaukon who came to Messene was a descendant
of Phlyus, and proves my other statements with regard to Lykos, and that
the mysteries were originally at Andania. And it seems natural to me
that Messene should have established the mysteries where she and
Polycaon lived, not anywhere else.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.2.1">

As I was extremely anxious to learn what children were born to Polycaon
by Messene, I read the poem called
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Ehoiai</span> and the epic
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Naupactia</span>, and in addition to
these all the genealogies of Cinaethon and Asios. However, they made no
reference to this matter, although I know that the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Great Ehoiai</span> says that
Polycaon, the son of Butes, married Euaichme, the daughter of Hyllos,
son of Hēraklēs, but it omits all reference to the husband of Messene
and to Messene herself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.2.2">

Some time later, as no descendant of Polycaon survived (in my opinion
his house lasted for five generations, but no more), they summoned
Perieres, the son of Aeolus, as king. To him, the Messenians say, came
Melaneus, a good archer and considered for this reason to be a son of
Apollo; Perieres assigned to him as a dwelling a part of the country now
called the Carnasium, but which then received the name Oechalia,
derived, as they say, from the wife of Melaneus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.2.3">

Most matters of Greek history have come to be disputed. The Thessalians
say that Eurytium, which today is not inhabited, was formerly a city and
was called Oechalia. The account given by the Euboeans agrees with the
statements of Kreophylos in his
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Herakleia</span>; and Hecataeus of
Miletus stated that Oechalia is in Scius, a part of the territory of
Eretria. Nevertheless, I think that the whole version of the Messenians
is more probable than these, particularly on account of the bones of
Eurytos, which my story will deal with later.[^277]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.2.4">

Perieres had issue by Gorgophone the daughter of Perseus, Aphareus and
Leukippos, and after his death they inherited the Messenian kingdom. But
Aphareus had the greater authority. On his accession he founded a city
Arene, named after the daughter of Oibalos, who was both his wife and
sister by the same mother. For Gorgophone was married to Oibalos. The
facts regarding her have already been given twice, in my account of the
Argolid and of Laconia.[^278]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.2.5">

Aphareus then founded the city of Arena in Messenia, and received into
his house his cousin Neleus the son of Kretheus, son of Aeolus (he was
also called a son of Poseidon), when he was driven from Iolcos by
Pelias. He gave him the maritime part of the land, where with other
towns was Pylos, in which Neleus settled and established his palace.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.2.6">

Lykos the son of Pandion also came to Arene, when he too was driven from
Athens by his brother Aigeus, and revealed the rites of the Great
Goddesses to Aphareus and his children and to his wife Arene; but it was
to Andania that he brought the rites and revealed them there, as it was
there that Kaukon initiated Messene.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.2.7">

Of the children born to Aphareus Idas was the elder and more brave,
Lynkeus the younger; he, if Pindar’s words are credible,[^279] possessed
eyesight so keen that he saw through the trunk of an oak. We know of no
child of Lynkeus, but Idas had by Marpessa a daughter Kleopatra, who
married Meleagros. The writer of the epic
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Cypria</span> says that the wife of
Protesilaos, the first who dared to land when the Greeks reached Troy,
was named Polydora, whom he calls a daughter of Meleagros the son of
Oineus. If this is correct, these three women, the first of whom was
Marpessa, all slew themselves on the death of their husbands.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.1">

After the fight about the cattle between the sons of Aphareus and their
cousins the Dioskouroi, when Lynkeus was killed by Polydeukes and Idas
met his doom from the lightning, the house of Aphareus was bereft of all
male descendants, and the kingdom of Messenia passed to Nestor the son
of Neleus, including all the part ruled formerly by Idas, but not that
subject to the sons of Asklepios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.2">

For they say that the sons of Asklepios who went to Troy were
Messenians, Asklepios being the son of Arsinoe, daughter of Leukippos,
not the son of Korōnis, and they call a desolate spot in Messenia by the
name Tricca and quote the lines of Homer,[^280] in which Nestor tends
Makhaon kindly, when he has been wounded by the arrow. He would not have
shown such readiness except to a neighbor and king of a kindred people.
But the surest warrant for their account of the Asclepiadae is that they
point to a tomb of Makhaon in Gerenia and to the sanctuary of his sons
at Pharai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.3">

After the conclusion of the Trojan war and the death of Nestor after his
return home, the Dorian expedition and return of the Herakleidai, which
took place two generations later, drove the descendants of Nestor from
Messenia. This has already formed a part of my account of
Tisamenus.[^281] I will only add the following: When the Dorians
assigned Argos to Temenus, Kresphontes asked them for the land of
Messenia, in that he was older than Aristodemos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.4">

Aristodemos was now dead, but Kresphontes was vigorously opposed by
Theras the son of Autesion, who was of Theban origin and fourth in
descent from Polyneikes the son of Oedipus. He was at that time guardian
of the sons of Aristodemos, being their uncle on the mother’s side,
Aristodemos having married a daughter of Autesion, called Argeia.
Kresphontes, wishing to obtain Messenia as his portion at all costs,
approached Temenus, and having suborned him pretended to leave the
decision to the lot.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.5">

Temenus put the lots of the children of Aristodemos and of Kresphontes
into a jar containing water, the terms being that the party whose lot
came up first should be the first to choose a portion of the country.
Temenus had caused both lots to be made of clay, but for the sons of
Aristodemos sun-dried, for Kresphontes baked with fire. So the lot of
the sons of Aristodemos was dissolved, and Kresphontes, winning in this
way, chose Messenia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.6">

The common people of the old Messenians were not dispossessed by the
Dorians, but agreed to be ruled by Kresphontes and to divide the land
with the Dorians. They were induced to give way to them in this by the
suspicion which they felt for their rulers, as the Neleidai were
originally of Iolcos. Kresphontes took to wife Merope the daughter of
Kypselos, then king of the Arcadians, by whom with other children was
born to him Aipytos his youngest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.7">

He had the palace, which he and his children were to occupy, built in
Stenyclerus. Originally Perieres and the other kings dwelled at Andania,
but when Aphareus founded Arene, he and his sons settled there. In the
time of Nestor and his descendants the palace was at Pylos, but
Kresphontes ordained that the king should live in Stenyclerus. As his
government for the most part was directed in favor of the people, the
rich rebelled and killed Kresphontes and all his sons except Aipytos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.8">

He was still a boy and being brought up by Kypselos, and was the sole
survivor of his house. When he reached manhood, he was brought back by
the Arcadians to Messene, the other Dorian kings, the sons of
Aristodemos and Isthmios, the son of Temenus, helping to restore him. On
becoming king, Aipytos punished his father’s murderers and all who had
been accessories to the crime. By winning the Messenian nobles to his
side by deference, and all who were of the people by gifts, he attained
to such honor that his descendants were given the name of Aipytidai
instead of Herakleidai.

</div>

Glaukos, his son and successor, was content to imitate his father in all
other matters, both publicly and in his treatment of individuals, but
attained to greater piety. For the precinct of Zeus on the summit of
Ithome, having been consecrated by Polycaon and Messene, had hitherto
received no honor among the Dorians, and it was Glaukos who established
this worship among them and he was the first to sacrifice to Makhaon the
son of Asklepios in Gerenia, and to assign to Messene, the daughter of
Triopas, the honors customarily paid to heroes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.3.10">

Isthmios the son of Glaukos built a shrine also to Gorgasus and
Nikomakhos which is in Pharai. Isthmios had a son Dotadas, who
constructed the harbor at Mothone, though Messenia contained others.
Sybotas the son of Dotadas established the annual sacrifice by the king
to the river Pamisus and also the offering to the hero Eurytos the son
of Melaneus at Oechalia before the mysteries of the great Goddesses,
which were still held at Andania.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.1">

In the reign of Phintas the son of Sybotas the Messenians for the first
time sent an offering and chorus of men to Apollo at Delos. Their
processional hymn to the god was composed by Eumēlos, this poem being
the only one of his that is considered genuine. It was in the reign of
Phintas that a quarrel first took place with the Lacedaemonians. The
very cause is disputed, but is said to have been as follows:

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.2">

There is a sanctuary of Artemis called Limnatis (of the Lake) on the
frontier of Messenian, in which the Messenians and the Lacedaemonians
alone of the Dorians shared. According to the Lacedaemonians their girls
coming to the festival were violated by Messenian men and their king was
killed in trying to prevent it. He was Teleklos the son of Arkhelaos,
son of Agesilaos, son of Doryssus, son of Labotas, son of Ekhestratos,
son of Agis. In addition to this they say that the girls who were
violated killed themselves for shame.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.3">

The Messenians say that a plot was formed by Teleklos against persons of
the highest rank in Messene who had come to the sanctuary, his incentive
being the excellence of the Messenian land; in furtherance of his design
he selected some Spartan youths, all without beards, dressed them in
girls’ clothes and ornaments, and providing them with daggers introduced
them among the Messenians when they were resting; the Messenians, in
defending themselves, killed the beardless youths and Teleklos himself;
but the Lacedaemonians, they say, whose king did not plan this without
the general consent, being conscious that they had begun the wrong, did
not demand justice for the murder of Teleklos. These are the accounts
given by the two sides; one may believe them according to one’s feelings
towards either side.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.4">

A generation later in the reign of Alkamenes the son of Teleklos in
Lacedaemon—the king of the other house was Theopompos the son of
Nikandros, son of Kharillos, son of Polydektes, son of Eunomos, son of
Prytanis, son of Eurypon in Messenia Antiokhos and Androkles, the sons
of Phintas were reigning—the mutual hatred of the Lacedaemonians and
Messenians was aroused, and the Lacedaemonians began war, obtaining a
pretext which was not only sufficient for them, eager for a quarrel as
they were and resolved on war at all costs, but also plausible in the
highest degree, although with a more peaceful disposition it could have
been settled by the decision of a court. What happened was as follows.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.5">

There was a Messenian Polykhares, a man of no small distinction in all
respects and an Olympic victor. (The people of Elis were holding the
fourth Olympiad,[^282] the only event being the short foot-race, when
Polykhares won his victory.) This man, possessing cattle without land of
his own to provide them with sufficient grazing, gave them to a Spartan
Euaephnus to feed on his own land, Euaephnus to have a share of the
produce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.6">

Now Euaephnus was a man who set unjust gain above loyalty, and a
trickster besides. He sold the cattle of Polykhares to some merchants
who put in to Laconia, and went himself to inform Polykhares but he said
that pirates had landed in the country, had overcome him and carried off
the cattle and the herdsmen. While he was trying to deceive him by his
lies, one of the herdsmen, escaping in the meantime from the merchants,
returned and found Euaephnus there with his master, and convicted him
before Polykhares.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.7">

Thus caught and unable to deny it, he made many appeals to Polykhares
himself and to his son to grant him pardon; for among the many
inducements to be found in human nature which drive us to wrongdoing the
love of gain exercises the greatest power. He stated the price which he
had received for the cattle and begged that the son of Polykhares should
come with him to receive it. When on their way they reached Laconia,
Euaephnus dared a deed more impious than the first; he murdered
Polykhares’ son.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.4.8">

Polykhares, when he heard of this new misfortune, went to Lacedaemon and
plagued the kings and ephors, loudly lamenting his son and recounting
the wrongs that he had suffered from Euaephnus, whom he had made his
friend and trusted above all the Lacedaemonians. Obtaining no redress in
spite of continual visits to the authorities, Polykhares at last was
driven out of his mind, gave way to his rage, and, regardless of
himself, dared to murder every Lacedaemonian whom he could capture.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.1">

The Lacedaemonians say that they went to war because Polykhares was not
surrendered to them, and on account of the murder of Teleklos; even
before this they had been suspicious on account of the wrongdoing of
Kresphontes in the matter of the lot. The Messenians make the reply that
I have already given with regard to Teleklos, and point to the fact that
the sons of Aristodemos helped to restore Aipytos the son of
Kresphontes, which they would never have done if they had been at
variance with Kresphontes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.2">

They say that they did not surrender Polykhares to the Lacedaemonians
for punishment because they also had not surrendered Euaephnus, but that
they offered to stand trial at the meeting of the league before the
Argives, kinsmen of both parties, and to submit the matter to the court
in Athens called the Areiopagos, as this court was held to exercise an
ancient jurisdiction in cases pertaining to murder.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.3">

They say that these were not the reasons of the Lacedaemonians in going
to war, but that they had formed designs on their country through
covetousness, as in others of their actions, bringing forward against
them their treatment of the Arcadians and of the Argives; for in both
cases they have never been satisfied with their continual encroachments.
When Croesus sent them presents they were the first to become friends
with the barbarian, after he had reduced the other Greeks of Asia Minor
and all the Dorians who live on the Carian mainland.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.4">

They point out too that when the leaders of Phokis had seized the temple
at Delphi, the kings and every Spartan of repute privately, and the
board of ephors and senate publicly, had a share of the god’s property.
As the most convincing proof that the Lacedaemonians would stick at
nothing for the sake of gain, they reproach them with their alliance
with Apollodoros, who became tyrant in Cassandreia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.5">

I could not introduce into the present account the reasons why the
Messenians have come to regard this as so bitter a reproach. Although
the courage of the Messenians and the length of time for which they
fought differ from the facts of the tyranny of Apollodoros, in their
disastrous character the sufferings of the people of Cassandreia would
not fall far short of the Messenian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.6">

These then are the reasons for the war which the two sides allege. An
embassy then came from the Lacedaemonians to demand the surrender of
Polykhares. The Messenian kings replied to the ambassadors that after
deliberation with the people they would send the findings to Sparta and
after their departure they themselves summoned the citizens to a
meeting. The views put forward differed widely, Androkles urging the
surrender of Polykhares as guilty of an impious and abominable crime.
Antiokhos among other arguments urged against him that it would be the
most piteous thing that Polykhares should suffer before the eyes of
Euaephnus, and enumerated in detail all that he would have to undergo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.7">

Finally the supporters of Androkles and of Antiokhos were so carried
away that they took up arms. But the battle did not last long, for the
party of Antiokhos, far outnumbering the other, killed Androkles and his
principal supporters, Antiokhos, now sole king, sent to Sparta that he
was ready to submit the matter to the courts which I have already
mentioned. But the Lacedaemonians are said to have made no reply to the
bearers of the letter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.8">

Not many months later Antiokhos died and his son Euphaes succeeded to
the kingdom. The Lacedaemonians, without sending a herald to declare war
on the Messenians or renouncing their friendship beforehand, had made
their preparations secretly and with all the concealment possible; they
first took an oath that neither the length of the war, should it not be
decided soon, nor their disasters, however great they might be, would
deter them until they won the land of Messenia by the sword.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.9">

After taking this oath, they attacked Ampheia by night, appointing
Alkamenes the son of Teleklos leader of the force. Ampheia is a small
town in Messenia near the Laconian border, of no great size, but
situated on a high hill and possessing copious springs of water. It
seemed generally a suitable base for the whole war. The gates being open
and the town not garrisoned, they took it and killed the Messenians
captured there, some still in their beds and others who had taken refuge
at the sanctuaries and altars of the gods when they realized what had
happened. Those who escaped were few.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.5.10">

This was the first attack which the Lacedaemonians made on the
Messenians, in the second year of the ninth Olympiad,[^283] when
Xenodocus of Messenia won the short foot-race. In Athens the office of
an archon \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] who
is annually appointed by lot did not yet exist, At first, the people
deprived the descendants of Melanthos, called Medontidai, of most of
their power, transforming the kingship into a constitutional office;
afterwards they limited their tenure of office to ten years. At the time
of the seizure of Ampheia, Aesimides the son of Aeschylus was holding
his fifth year office in Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.6.1">

Before I wrote the history of the war and all the sufferings and actions
that the superhuman force \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ho
daimōn</span>\] prepared in it for both sides, I wished to reach a
decision regarding the age of a certain Messenian. This war was fought
between the Lacedaemonians with their allies and the Messenians with
their supporters, but received its name not from the invaders like the
Persian and Peloponnesian wars, but was called Messenian from their
disasters, just as the name Trojan war, rather than Greek, came to be
universally applied to the war at Troy. An account of this war of the
Messenians has been given by Rhianus of Bene in his epic, and by Myron
of Priene.[^284] Myron’s history is in prose.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.6.2">

Neither writer achieved a complete and continuous account of the whole
war from its beginning to the end, but only of the part which each
selected: Myron narrated the capture of Ampheia and subsequent events
down to the death of Aristodemos; Rhianus did not touch this first war
at all. He described the events that in time befell the Messenians after
their revolt from the Lacedaemonians, not indeed the whole of them, but
those subsequent to the battle which they fought at the Great Trench, as
it is called.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.6.3">

The Messenian, Aristomenes, on whose account I have made my whole
mention of Rhianus and Myron, was the man who first and foremost raised
the name of Messene to renown. He was introduced by Myron into his
history, while to Rhianus in his epic Aristomenes is as great a man as
is the Achilles of the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>
to Homer. As their statements differ so widely, it remained for me to
adopt one or other of the accounts, but not both together, and Rhianus
appeared to me to have given the more probable account as to the age of
Aristomenes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.6.4">

One may realize in others of his works that Myron gives no heed to the
question of his statements seeming to lack truth and credibility, and
particularly in this Messenian history. For he has made Aristomenes kill
Theopompos, the king of the Lacedaemonians, shortly before the death of
Aristodemos but we know that Theopompos was not killed either in battle
or in any other way before the war was concluded.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.6.5">

It was this Theopompos who put an end to the war, and my evidence is the
lines of Tyrtaeus, which say:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“To our king beloved of the gods, Theopompos, through whom we took
Messene with wide dancing-grounds.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Tyrtaeus, unknown location.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Aristomenes then in my view belongs to the time of the second war, and I
will relate his history when I come to this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.6.6">

The Messenians, when they heard of the events at Ampheia from the actual
survivors from the captured town, mustered in Stenyclerus from their
cities. When the people had gathered in the assembly, first the leading
men and finally the king exhorted them not to be panic-stricken at the
sack of Ampheia, or to suppose that the issue of the whole war had
already been decided thereby, or to be afraid of the power of the
Lacedaemonians as superior to their own. For the Lacedaemonians had
longer practice in warfare, but they themselves had a stronger necessity
to show themselves brave men, and greater goodwill would be shown by the
gods to men defending their country, who were not the authors of
injustice.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.1">

With these words Euphaes dismissed the gathering, and henceforward kept
all the Messenians under arms, compelling the untrained to learn the art
of war and the trained men to undergo a more rigorous discipline than
before. The Lacedaemonians carried out raids into Messenia, but did no
harm to the country, regarding it as their own, nor did they cut down
trees or demolish buildings, but they drove off any cattle that they met
with, and carried off the wheat and other produce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.2">

They made assaults on the towns but captured none, as they were
fortified with walls and carefully garrisoned. They withdrew with loss
and without effecting anything, and finally gave up attempting the
towns. The Messenians also ravaged the Laconian coast and all the
cultivated land round Taygetos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.3">

Three years after the capture of Ampheia, being eager to put to use the
spirit of the Messenians, now at the height of their passion against the
Lacedaemonians, and considering too that they had undergone sufficient
training, Euphaes ordered an advance. He ordered the slaves also to
accompany him, bringing wood and all else that was required for the
making of an entrenched camp. The Lacedaemonians heard from their
garrison at Ampheia that the Messenians were marching out, so they also
came out to battle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.4">

There was a place in Messenia which was in other ways suitable for an
engagement, but had a deep ravine in front of it. Here Euphaes drew up
the Messenians and appointed Kleonnis general; the cavalry and
light-armed, together amounting to less than 500, were commanded by
Pytharatos and Antandros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.5">

As the two forces were about to engage, the ravine which divided them
prevented the heavy-armed from coming to close quarters, though they
approached one another eagerly and with a recklessness born of hate. The
cavalry and light-armed engaged above the ravine, but as they were
equally matched in numbers and skill, for this reason the fight was
indecisive.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.6">

While they were involved, Euphaes ordered the slaves to fortify with a
palisade first the rear of his force and afterwards both flanks, and
when the battle had been broken off at nightfall, they fortified his
front also on the ravine. So at daybreak the Lacedaemonians realized the
forethought of Euphaes. They had no means of fighting the Messenians
unless they came out from the stockade, and despaired of forming a
siege, for which they were unprepared in all things alike.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.7">

They then returned home; but a year later, when the older men reviled
them and taunted them both with cowardice and disregard of their oath,
they made a second expedition openly against the Messenians. Both kings
were in command, Theopompos the son of Nikandros and Polydoros the son
of Alkamenes, Alkamenes being no longer alive. The Messenians encamped
opposite them, and when the Spartans endeavored to join battle, went out
to meet them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.8">

The Lacedaemonian commander on the left wing was Polydoros, and
Theopompos on the right. The center was held by Euryleon, now a
Lacedaemonian, but of Theban origin of the house of Kadmos, fourth in
descent from Aigeus the son of Oiolykos, son of Theras, son of Autesion.
On the side of the Messenians Antandros and Euphaes were posted opposite
the Lacedaemonian right; the other wing, opposite Polydoros, was held by
Pytharatos, with Kleonnis in the center.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.9">

As they were about to engage, the kings came forward to encourage their
men. The words of encouragement addressed by Theopompos to the
Lacedaemonians were few, according to their native custom. He reminded
them of their oath against the Messenians, and said how noble was their
ambition, to prove themselves to have done a deed more glorious than
their fathers, who subdued the neighboring peoples, and to have won a
more fortunate land. Euphaes spoke at greater length than the Spartan,
but no more than he saw the occasion admitted.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.10">

He declared that the contest would be not only for land and possessions,
but he knew well what would overtake them if defeated. Their wives and
children would be carried off as slaves, and death unaccompanied by
outrage would be the mildest fate for their grown men their sanctuaries
would be despoiled and their ancestral homes burned. His words were not
supposition, the fate of the men captured at Ampheia was evidence that
all could see.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.7.11">

Better a noble death than such evils; it was far easier for them, while
still undefeated and equally matched in courage, to outdo their
adversaries in zeal than to repair their losses when once they had lost
heart.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.1">

Such were the words of Euphaes. When the leaders on either side gave the
signal, the Messenians charged the Lacedaemonians recklessly like men
eager for death in their wrath, each one of them eager to be the first
to join battle. The Lacedaemonians also advanced to meet them eagerly,
but were careful not to break their ranks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.2">

When they were about to come to close quarters, they threatened one
another by brandishing their arms and with fierce looks, and fell to
recriminations, these calling the Messenians already their slaves, no
freer than the Helots; the others answering that they were impious in
their undertaking, who for the sake of gain attacked their kinsmen and
outraged all the ancestral gods of the Dorians, and Hēraklēs above all.
And now with their taunts they come to deeds, mass thrusting against
mass, especially on the Lacedaemonian side, and man attacking man.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.3">

The Lacedaemonians were far superior both in tactics and training, and
also in numbers, for they had with them the neighboring peoples already
reduced and serving in their ranks, and the Dryopes of Asine, who a
generation earlier had been driven out of their own country by the
Argives and had come as suppliants to Lacedaemon, were forced to serve
in the army. Against the Messenian light-armed they employed Cretan
archers as mercenaries.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.4">

The Messenians were inspired alike by desperation and readiness to face
death, regarding all their sufferings as necessary rather than terrible
to men who honored their country, and exaggerating their achievements
and the consequences to the Lacedaemonians. Some of them leapt forth
from the ranks, displaying glorious deeds of valor, in others fatally
wounded and scarce breathing the frenzy of despair still reigned.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.5">

They encouraged one another, the living and unwounded urging the
stricken before their last moment came to sell their lives as dearly as
they could and accept their fate with joy. And the wounded, when they
felt their strength ebbing and breath failing, urged the unwounded to
prove themselves no less valorous than they and not to render their
death of no avail to their fatherland.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.6">

The Lacedaemonians refrained from exhorting one another, and were less
inclined than the Messenians to engage in striking deeds of valor. As
they were versed in warfare from boyhood, they employed a deeper
formation and hoped that the Messenians would not endure the contest for
so long as they, or sustain the toil of battle or wounds.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.7">

These were the differences in both sets of combatants in action and in
feeling; but on both sides alike the conquered made no appeals or
promises of ransom, perhaps in their enmity despairing of getting
quarter, but mainly because they scorned to disgrace their previous
achievements. The victorious refrained alike from boasting and from
taunts, neither side having yet sure hopes of victory. The most
remarkable was the death of those who tried to strip any of the fallen.
For if they exposed any part of their bodies, they were struck with
javelins or were struck down while intent on their present occupation,
or were killed by those whom they were plundering who still lived.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.8">

The kings fought in a manner that deserves mention. Theopompos rushed
wildly forward to slay Euphaes himself. Euphaes, seeing him advancing,
said to Antandros that the action of Theopompos was no different from
the attempt of his ancestor Polyneikes; for Polyneikes led an army from
Argos against his fatherland, and slaying his brother with his own hand
was slain by him. Theopompos was ready to involve the lineage of the
Herakleidai in pollution as great as that of the house of Laios and
Oedipus, but he would not leave the field unscathed. With these words he
too advanced.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.9">

Thereupon the battle, though the combatants had wearied, everywhere
broke out again in full force. Their strength was renewed and
recklessness of death heightened on both sides, so that it might have
been thought that they were engaging for the first time. Finally Euphaes
and his men in a frenzy of despair that was near to madness (for picked
Messenian troops formed the whole of the king’s bodyguard), overpowering
the enemy by their valor, drove back Theopompos himself and routed the
Lacedaemonian troops opposed to them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.10">

But the other Messenian wing was in difficulties, for the general
Pytharatos had been killed, and the men, without a commander, were
fighting in a disorganized and confused manner, though not without
heart. Polydoros did not pursue the Messenians when they gave way, nor
Euphaes’ men the Lacedaemonians. It seemed better to him and his men to
support the defeated wing; they did not, however, engage with Polydoros’
force, for darkness had already descended on the field;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.11">

moreover, the Lacedaemonians were prevented from following the retiring
force further not least by their ignorance of the country. Also it was
an ancient practice with them not to carry out a pursuit too quickly, as
they were more careful about maintaining their formation than about
slaying the flying. In the center, where Euryleon was commanding the
Lacedaemonians, and Kleonnis on the Messenian side, the contest was
undecided; the coming of night separated them here also.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.12">

This battle was fought principally or entirely by the heavy-armed troops
on both sides. The mounted men were few and achieved nothing worth
mention; for the Peloponnesians were not good horsemen then. The
Messenian light-armed and the Cretans on the Lacedaemonian side did not
engage at all; for on both sides according to the ancient practice they
were posted in reserve to their own infantry.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.8.13">

The following day neither side was minded to begin battle or to be the
first to set up a trophy, but as the day advanced they made proposals
for taking up the dead; when this was agreed on both sides, they
proceeded to bury them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.1">

But after the battle the affairs of the Messenians began to get serious.
They were exhausted by the expenditure of money devoted to the
garrisoning of the towns, and their slaves were deserting to the
Lacedaemonians. They were visited also by disease, which caused alarm,
as resembling plague, although it did not attack all. In these
circumstances they resolved to desert all their numerous towns inland
and to settle on Mount Ithome.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.2">

A small town existed here, which they say Homer mentions in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Catalogue</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Stepped Ithome.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 2.729

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

To this town they withdrew, extending the old circuit to form a
sufficient protection for them all. The place was strong in other
respects, for Ithome falls short of none of the mountains within the
Isthmus in height and at this point was most difficult to climb.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.3">

They also resolved to send an envoy to Delphi, and despatched Tisis the
son of Alcis, a man of the highest reputation, considered to be fully
versed in divination. While he was returning from Delphi men from the
Lacedaemonian garrison at Ampheia laid an ambush for him. Though
trapped, he did not submit to be made a prisoner, but stood his ground
to resist in spite of the wounds he received, until a voice was heard
from an unseen quarter, “Let the bearer of the oracle go free.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.4">

Tisis, reaching Ithome with all speed, delivered the oracle to the king,
and soon afterwards died of his wounds. Euphaes assembled the Messenians
and made known the oracle:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Ye shall sacrifice a pure maiden to the gods below, appointed by lot of
the blood of the sons of Aipytos, and slay her by night. But if that ye
cannot do, offer a maiden from another house, if the father gives her
freely for the slaughter.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.5">

When the god declared this, all the girls of the house of the Aipytidai
forthwith cast lots, and the lot fell on the daughter of Lykiskos. But
Epebolus the seer forbade them to offer her, for she was not the
daughter of Lykiskos, but the woman who was married to Lykiskos being
unable to bear a child had palmed off the girl as hers. While Epebolus
was making this declaration, Lykiskos took the girl away and deserted to
Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.6">

The Messenians were in despair when they saw that Lykiskos had fled;
thereupon Aristodemos, a son of the house of the Aipytidai, of higher
standing than Lykiskos both in reputation and in war, freely offered his
daughter for the sacrifice. But human affairs and human purpose above
all are obscured by fate, just as the mud of a river hides a pebble; for
when Aristodemos was striving his utmost to save Messene, fate set this
obstacle in his path.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.7">

A Messenian, whose name is not recorded, was in love with the daughter
of’ Aristodemos, and was already about to make her his wife. He at first
disputed the rights of Aristodemos over the girl for Aristodemos, since
he had betrothed her to himself had no further rights over the girl, but
he to whom she was betrothed had greater rights than the father. Next,
when he saw that this was of no avail, he had recourse to a shameless
plea, that the girl was with child by him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.8">

At last he drove Aristodemos to such a fury of passion that lie killed
his daughter; then cutting her open he showed that she was not pregnant.
Epebolus, who was present, ordered another man to come forward and offer
his daughter, for the daughter of Aristodemos was of no avail to them
dead; for the father had murdered her, not offered her to the gods whom
the Pythia ordained.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.9">

When the seer said this, the multitude of the Messenians rushed on the
girl’s lover to kill him, since he had fixed the guilt of bloodshed on
Aristodemos to no purpose, and had made their hopes of safety doubtful.
But as he was a close friend of Euphaes, Euphaes persuaded the
Messenians that the oracle was fulfilled by the death of the girl and
that the deed done by Aristodemos sufficed for them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.9.10">

When he said this, all the members of the house of the Aipytidai said
that he spoke truth, for each was eager to be rid of the terror
threatening his daughter. The people took the advice of the king and
broke up the assembly and thereupon turned to sacrifices to the gods and
feasting.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.10.1">

But the Lacedaemonians, when they heard the oracle given to the
Messenians, were in despair, both they and their kings, and for the
future shrank from offering battle.

</div>

But five years after the escape of Lykiskos from Ithome, the victims
being auspicious, the Lacedaemonians marched against Ithome. The Cretans
were no longer with them. The allies of the Messenians also were late,
for the Spartans had now incurred the suspicion of others of the
Peloponnesians, especially of the Arcadians and Argives. The Argives
intended to come without the knowledge of the Lacedaemonians, and by
private enterprise rather than by public declaration. The expedition was
openly proclaimed among the Arcadians, but they did not arrive either.
For the Messenians were induced by the credit placed in the oracle to
face the risk without allies.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.10.2">

This engagement did not differ in most points from the first, as on this
occasion too daylight failed the combatants, but they record that on
neither side was a wing or division broken, as they did not maintain the
formation in which they were originally posted, champions on either side
meeting in the middle, and there supporting the whole combat.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.10.3">

Euphaes, who showed more eagerness than a king should and recklessly
attacked those guarding Theopompos, received a number of mortal wounds.
When he swooned and fell, the Lacedaemonians did their utmost to drag
him into their own ranks, as he still breathed. But the Messenians were
roused by the affection which they felt for their king and by the
reproach which would be theirs. It seemed better to die for their kings
and sacrifice their lives than that he should be abandoned while one of
them escaped.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.10.4">

So the fall of Euphaes prolonged the battle and called forth further
deeds of daring on both sides. He came to himself later and saw that his
men had not had the worst of the fight, but he died in a few days,
having reigned thirteen years over the Messenians, and having been at
war with the Lacedaemonians for the whole of his reign.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.10.5">

Euphaes, having no children, left his kingdom to the man chosen by the
people. Kleonnis and Damis came forward to dispute it with Aristodemos,
as they were considered superior to him in war and all else. Antandros
had been killed by the enemy, risking his life for Euphaes in the
battle. The views of both the seers, Epebolus and Ophioneus, were
identical, that they should not give the honors of Aipytos and his
descendants to a man who was accursed and polluted by the murder of his
daughter. Nevertheless Aristodemos was chosen and became king.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.10.6">

This Ophioneus, the Messenian seer, was blind from birth and practiced
the following method of divination. By learning the facts relevant to
each case, both private and public, he thus foretold the future. This
then was the way he practiced his art. Aristodemos, becoming king,
constantly was ready to show all reasonable favor to the people, and
held all the nobles in honor, especially Kleonnis and Damis. He
maintained good relations with the allies, sending gifts to the Arcadian
leaders and to Argos and Sikyon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.10.7">

They carried on the war during his reign by means of constant forays
with small parties, and made incursions into one another’s country at
harvest time, the Messenians being supported by the Arcadians in their
raids into Laconia. The Argives did not think fit to declare their
hatred for the Lacedaemonians beforehand, but prepared to take part in
the contest when it came.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.1">

In the fifth year of the reign of Aristodemos, being exhausted by the
length of the war and by their expenditure, after due notice that a
battle would be fought, both sides were joined by their allies, the
Lacedaemonians by the Corinthians alone of the Peloponnesians, the
Messenians by the full muster of the Arcadians and by picked troops from
Argos and Sikyon. The Lacedaemonians entrusted their center to the
Corinthians, Helots and all the neighboring peoples who were serving
with them; they themselves and the kings were posted on the wings in a
deeper and closer formation than ever before.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.2">

The dispositions of Aristodemos and his men were as follows: he selected
the most serviceable of the arms for all the Arcadians and Messenians
who were physically strong and stout hearted but did not possess
powerful weapons, and as the matter was urgent, posted them with the
Argives and Sikyonians, extending the line that they might not be
surrounded by the enemy. He also took care that they should be drawn up
with Mount Ithome in their rear. Placing Kleonnis in command of these
troops,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.3">

he himself and Damis remained in reserve with the light troops
consisting of a few slingers or archers, the bulk of the force being
physically suited to rapid assaults and retirements and lightly armed.
Not all of them possessed a breastplate or shield, but those who lacked
them were protected with the skins of goats and sheep, some of them,
particularly the Arcadian mountaineers, having the hides of wild beasts,
wolves and bears.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.4">

Each carried several javelins, and some of them spears. While these were
in ambush in a part of Ithome where they were least likely to be
visible, the heavy-armed troops of the Messenians and their allies
withstood the first assault of the Lacedaemonians, and continued after
this to show courage in every way. They were inferior in numbers to the
enemy, but were picked men fighting against levies, not selected troops
like themselves, and so, by their bravery and training were more able to
maintain a lengthy resistance.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.5">

Then the mobile Messenian force, when the signal was given to them,
charged the Lacedaemonians and enveloping them threw javelins on their
flanks. All who were of higher courage ran in and struck at close
quarters. The Lacedaemonians, faced simultaneously with a second and
unforeseen danger, were not demoralized, but turning on the light
troops, tried to defend themselves. But, as the enemy with their light
equipment drew off without difficulty, the Lacedaemonians were filled
with perplexity and, as a consequence, with anger.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.6">

Men are apt to be most annoyed by what they regard as beneath them. So
then the Spartans who had already been wounded and all who after the
fall of their comrades were the first to meet the attack of the light
troops, ran out to meet them when they saw the light troops advancing
and hotly extended the pursuit as they retired. The Messenian light
troops maintained their original tactics, striking and shooting at them
when they stood still, and outstripping them in flight when they
pursued, attacking again as they tried to retire.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.7">

They did this in separate parties and at different points of the enemy’s
line. The Messenian heavy-armed and their allies meantime pressed more
boldly on the troops facing them. Finally the Lacedaemonians, worn out
by the length of the battle and their wounds, and demoralized contrary
to their custom by the light troops, broke their ranks. When they had
been routed, the light troops inflicted greater damage on them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.11.8">

It was impossible to reckon the Lacedaemonian losses in the battle, but
I for my part am convinced that they were heavy. The rest made their
retreat homewards without molestation, but for the Corinthians it was
likely to be difficult, for whether they tried to retire through the
Argolid or by Sikyon, in either case it was through enemy country.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.1">

The Lacedaemonians were distressed by the reverse that had befallen
them. Their losses in the battle were great and included important men,
and they were inclined to despair of all hope in the war. For this
reason they sent envoys to Delphi, who received the following reply from
the Pythia:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Phoebus bids thee pursue not only the task of war with the hand, but by
guile a people holds the Messenian land, and by the same arts as they
first employed shall the people fall.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.2">

At this the kings and ephors were eager to invent stratagems, but
failed. They imitated that deed of Odysseus at Troy, and sent a hundred
men to Ithome to observe what the enemy were planning, but pretending to
be deserters. A sentence of banishment had been openly pronounced on
them. On their arrival Aristodemos at once sent them away, saying that
the crimes of the Lacedaemonians were new, but their tricks old.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.3">

Failing in their attempt, the Lacedaemonians next attempted to break up
the Messenian alliance. But when repulsed by the Arcadians, to whom
their ambassadors came first, they put off going to Argos. Aristodemos,
hearing of the Lacedaemonian intrigues, also sent men to enquire of the
god. And the Pythia replied to them:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.4">

“The god gives thee glory in war, but beware lest by guile the hated
company of Sparta scale the well-built walls, for mightier is their god
of war. And harsh shall be the dwellers in the circle of the dancing
ground, when the two have started forth by one chance from the hidden
ambush. Yet the holy day shall not behold this ending until their doom
overtake those which have changed their nature.”

</div>

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

At the time Aristodemos and the seers were at a loss to interpret the
saying, but in a few years the god was like to reveal it and bring it to
fulfillment.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.5">

Other things befell the Messenians at that time: while Lykiskos was
living abroad in Sparta, death overtook the daughter whom he carried
with him on his flight from Messene. As he often visited her tomb,
Arcadian horsemen lay in wait and captured him. When carried to Ithome
and brought into the assembly he urged that he had not departed a
traitor to his country, but because he believed the words of the seer
that the girl was not his own.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.6">

His defence did not win credence until the woman who was then holding
the priesthood of Hērā came into the theater. She confessed that she was
the mother of the girl and had given her to Lykiskos’ wife to pass off
as her own. “And now,” she said, “revealing the secret, I have come to
lay down my office.” She said this because it was an established custom
in Messene that, if a child of a man or woman holding a priesthood died
before its parent, the office should pass to another. Accepting the
truth of her statement, they chose another woman to take her place as
priestess of the goddess, and said that Lykiskos’ deed was pardonable.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.7">

After this, as the twentieth year of the war was approaching, they
resolved to send again to Delphi to ask concerning victory. The Pythia
made answer to their question:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

To those who first around the altar set up tripods ten times ten to Zeus
of Ithome, the superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ho daimōn</span>\] grants the
Messenian land in the glory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kudos</span>\] of war. For
thus has Zeus ordained with the nod of his head. Veering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">atē</span>\] had put you in
front and punishment
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tisis</span>\] follows after,
nor would you deceive
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ap-atân</span>\] the god. Act
in whatever way you must act. Fate wills. Veering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">atē</span>\] comes upon some
men before others.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.8">

Hearing this they thought that the oracle was in their favor and granted
them victory; for as they themselves possessed the sanctuary of Zeus of
Ithome within the walls, the Lacedaemonians could not forestall them in
making the dedication. They set about making tripods of wood, as they
had not money enough to make them of bronze. But one of the Delphians
reported the oracle to Sparta. When they heard it, no plan occurred to
them in public,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.9">

but Oibalos, a man of no repute in general, but evidently shrewd, made a
hundred tripods, as best he might, of clay, and hiding them in a bag,
carried nets with them like a hunter. As he was unknown even to most of
the Lacedaemonians, he would more easily escape detection by the
Messenians. Joining some countrymen, he entered Ithome with them, and as
soon as night fell, dedicated these tripods of clay to the god, and
returned to Sparta to tell the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.12.10">

The Messenians, when they saw them, were greatly disturbed, thinking,
rightly enough, that they were from the Lacedaemonians. Nevertheless
Aristodemos encouraged them, saying what the occasion demanded, and
setting up the wooden tripods, which had already been made, round the
altar of the god of Ithome. It happened also that Ophioneus, the seer
who had been blind from birth, received his sight in the most remarkable
way. He was seized with a violent pain in the head, and thereupon
received his sight.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.13.1">

Next, as fate was already inclining towards the conquest of the
Messenians, the god revealed to them the future. For the armed statue of
Artemis, which was all of bronze, let its shield fall. And as
Aristodemos was about to sacrifice the victims to Zeus of Ithome, the
rams of their own accord leapt towards the altar, and dashing their
horns violently against it were killed by the force of the blow. A third
portent befell them. The dogs assembled together and howled every night,
and at last fled together to the camp of the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.13.2">

Aristodemos was alarmed by this and by the following dream which came to
him. He thought that he was about to go forth armed to battle and the
victims’ entrails were lying before him on a table, when his daughter
appeared, wearing a black robe and showing her breast and belly cut
open; when she appeared she flung down what was on the table, stripped
him of his arms, and instead set a golden garland on his head and put a
white robe about him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.13.3">

Aristodemos, who was already in despair, thought the dream foretold the
end of life for him, because the Messenians used to carry out their
chiefs for burial wearing a garland and dressed in white garments. Then
he received news that Ophioneus the seer could no longer see but had
suddenly become blind, as he was at first. Then they understood the
oracle, that by the two starting forth from the ambush and again meeting
their doom the Pythia meant the eyes of Ophioneus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.13.4">

Then Aristodemos, reckoning up his private sorrows, that to no purpose
he had become the slayer of his daughter, and seeing that no hope of
safety remained for his country, slew himself upon the tomb of his
child. He had done all that human calculation could do to save the
Messenians, but fortune brought to naught both his achievements and his
plans. He had reigned six years and a few months when he died.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.13.5">

The Messenians were plunged into despair, and were even ready to send to
the Lacedaemonians to ask mercy, so demoralized were they by the death
of Aristodemos. Their pride, however, prevented them from doing this.
But they met in the assembly and chose not a king, but Damis as general
with absolute power. He selected Kleonnis and Phyleus as colleagues, and
even with their present resources made ready to join battle. For he was
forced to this by the blockade, and above all by famine and by the
consequent terror that they would be destroyed by want.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.13.6">

Even then the Messenians were not inferior in courage and brave deeds,
but all their generals were killed and their most notable men. After
this they held out for some five months, but as the year was coming to
an end deserted Ithome, the war having lasted twenty years in all, as is
stated in the poems of Tyrtaeus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“But in the twentieth year they left their rich tilled lands, and fled
from out the lofty mountains of Ithome.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Tyrtaeus, unknown location.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.13.7">

This war came to an end in the first year of the fourteenth
Olympiad,[^285] when Dasmon of Corinth won the short foot-race. In
Athens the Medontidai were still holding the title of archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] as a ten
years’ office, Hippomenes having completed his fourth year.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.1">

All the Messenians who had ties with Sikyon and Argos and among any of
the Arcadians retired to these states, but those who belonged to the
lineage of the Priests and performed the mysteries of the Great
Goddesses, to Eleusis. The majority of the common people were scattered
in their native towns, as before.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.2">

The Lacedaemonians first razed Ithome to the ground, then attacked and
captured the remaining towns. Of the spoils they dedicated bronze
tripods to the god of Amyklai. A statue of Aphrodite stands under the
first tripod, of Artemis under the second, of Kore or Demeter under the
third.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.3">

Dedicating these offerings at Amyklai, they gave to the people of Asine,
who had been driven out by the Argives, that part of Messenia on the
coast which they still occupy; to the descendants of Androkles (he had a
daughter, who with her children had fled at his death and come to
Sparta) they assigned the part called Hyamia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.4">

The Messenians themselves were treated in this way: First they exacted
an oath that they would never rebel or attempt any kind of revolution.
Secondly, though no fixed tribute was imposed on them, they used to
bring the half of all the produce of their fields to Sparta. It was also
ordained that for the funerals of the kings and other magistrates men
should come from Messene with their wives in black garments, and a
penalty was laid on those who disobeyed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.5">

As to the wanton punishments which they inflicted on the Messenians,
this is what is said in Tyrtaeus’ poems:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Like asses worn by their great burdens, bringing of dire necessity to
their masters the half of all the fruits the wheat-land bears.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Tyrtaeus, unknown location.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

That they were compelled to share their mourning, he shows by the
following:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Wailing for their masters, they and their wives alike, whensoever the
baneful doom of death came upon any.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Tyrtaeus, unknown location.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.6">

In these straits the Messenians, foreseeing no kindness from the
Lacedaemonians, and thinking death in battle or a complete migration
from Peloponnese preferable to their present lot, resolved at all costs
to revolt. They were incited to this mainly by the younger men, who were
still without experience of war but were of high spirit and preferred
death in a free country, even though slavery might bring happiness in
all else.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.7">

Of the young men who had grown up in Messenia the best and most numerous
were round Andania, and among them was Aristomenes, who to this day is
worshipped as a hero among the Messenians. They think that even the
circumstances of his birth were notable, for they assert that a spirit
or a god united with his mother, Nikoteleia, in the form of a serpent. I
know that the Macedonians tell a similar story about Olympias, and the
Sikyonians about Aristodama, but there is this difference:

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.14.8">

The Messenians do not make Aristomenes the son of Hēraklēs or of Zeus,
as the Macedonians do with Alexander and Ammon, and the Sikyonians with
Aratos and Asklepios. Most of the Greeks say that Pyrrhos was the father
of Aristomenes, but I myself know that in their libations the Messenians
call him Aristomenes son of Nikomedes. He then, being in the full vigor
of youth and courage, with others of the nobles incited them to revolt.
This was not done openly at first, but they sent secretly to Argos and
to the Arcadians, to ask if they were ready to help unhesitatingly and
no less energetically than in the former war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.1">

When all their preparations were made for the war, the readiness of
their allies exceeding expectation (for now the hatred which the Argives
and Arcadians felt for the Lacedaemonians had blazed up openly), they
revolted in the thirty-ninth year after the capture of Ithome, and in
the fourth year of the twenty-third Olympiad,[^286] when Icarus of
Hyreresia won the short foot-race. In Athens the title of archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\]was now of
annual tenure, and Tlesias held office.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.2">

Tyrtaeus has not recorded the names of the kings then reigning in
Lacedaemon, but Rhianos stated in his epic that Leotykhides was king at
the time of this war. I cannot agree with him at all on this point.
Though Tyrtaeus makes no statement, he may be regarded as having done so
by the following; there are lines of his which refer to the first war:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Around it they fought unceasingly for nineteen years, ever maintaining
a stout heart, the warrior fathers of our fathers.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Tyrtaeus, unknown.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.3">

It is obvious then that the Messenians went to war now in the second
generation after the first war, and the sequence of time shows that the
kings of Sparta at that time were Anaxandros the son of Eurycrates, son
of Polydoros, and of the other house Anaxidamos the son of Zeuxidamos,
son of Arkhidamos, son of Theopompos. I go as far as the third in
descent from Theopompos, because Arkhidamos the son of Theopompos died
before his father, and the kingdom of Theopompos passed to his grandson,
Zeuxidamos. But Leotykhides clearly succeeded Demaratos the son of
Ariston, Ariston being sixth in descent from Theopompos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.4">

In the first year after the revolt the Messenians engaged the
Lacedaemonians at a place called Derae in Messenia, both sides being
without their allies. Neither side won a clear victory, but Aristomenes
is said to have achieved more than it seemed that one man could, so
that, as he was of the lineage of the Aipytidai, they were for making
him king after the battle. As he declined, they appointed him general
with absolute power.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.5">

It was the view of Aristomenes that any man would be ready to die in
battle if he had first done deeds worthy of record, but that it was his
own especial task at the very beginning of the war to prove that he had
struck terror into the Lacedaemonians and that he would be more terrible
to them for the future. With this purpose he came by night to Lacedaemon
and fixed on the temple of Athena of the Brazen House a shield inscribed

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“The Gift of Aristomenes to the Goddess, taken from Spartans.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.6">

The Spartans received an oracle from Delphi that they should procure the
Athenian as counsellor. So they sent messengers to Athens to announce
the oracle, asking for a man to advise what they must do. The Athenians,
who were not anxious either that the Lacedaemonians should add to their
possessions the best part of Peloponnese without great dangers, or that
they themselves should disobey the god, made their plans accordingly.
There was a man Tyrtaeus, a teacher of letters, who was considered of
poor intellect and was lame in one foot. Him they sent to Sparta. On his
arrival he recited his poems in elegiacs and anapaests to the nobles in
private and to all whom he could collect.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.7">

A year after the fight at Derae, both sides being joined by their
allies, they prepared to join battle at the Boar’s Tomb, as it is
called. The Messenians had the men of Elis and the Arcadians and also
allies from Argos and from Sikyon. They were joined by all the
Messenians who had previously been in voluntary exile, together with
those from Eleusis, whose hereditary task it was to perform the rites of
the Great Goddesses, and the descendants of Androkles. These indeed were
their most zealous supporters.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.15.8">

The Corinthians came to fight on the side of the Lacedaemonians, and
some of the Lepreans owing to their hatred of the people of Elis. But
the people of Asine were bound by oaths to both sides. This spot, the
Boar’s Tomb, lies in Stenyclerus of Messenia, and there, as is said,
Hēraklēs exchanged oaths with the sons of Neleus over the pieces of a
boar.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.1">

Sacrifice was offered by the seers on both sides before the battle; on
the Lacedaemonian side by Hekas, descendant and namesake of the Hekas
who had come with the sons of Aristodemos to Sparta, on the Messenian
side by Theoklos, who was descended from Eumantis, a man from Elis, of
the lineage of the Iamidai, whom Kresphontes had brought to Messene.
Then in the presence of the seers both sides were spurred by greater
ardor for the fight.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.2">

All showed the zeal that befitted their age and strength, but
Anaxandros, the Lacedaemonian king, and his Spartan guard above all. On
the Messenian side the descendants of Androkles, Phintas and Androkles,
and their company tried to acquit themselves like brave men. Tyrtaeus
and the chief priests of the Great Goddesses took no part in the action,
but urged on the hindmost on their own sides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.3">

As to Aristomenes himself he had with him eighty picked men of the
Messenians of the same age as himself, each one of them thinking it the
highest honor that he had been thought worthy of a place in the troop
with Aristomenes. They were quick to understand each other’s movements,
especially those of their leader, when he began or contemplated any
manoeuvre. They themselves with Aristomenes were at first hard pressed
in face of Anaxandros and the Lacedaemonian champions, but receiving
wounds unflinchingly and slowing every form of desperate courage they
repulsed Anaxandros and his men by their long endurance and valor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.4">

As they fled, Aristomenes ordered another Messenian troop to undertake
the pursuit. He himself attacked the enemies’ line where it was firmest,
and after breaking it at this point sought a new point of assault. Soon
successful here, he was the more ready to assail those who stood their
ground, until he threw into confusion the whole line of the
Lacedaemonians themselves and of their allies. They were now running
without shame and without waiting for one another, while he assailed
them with a terror that seemed more than one man’s fury could inspire.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.5">

There was a wild pear tree growing in the plain, beyond which Theoklos
the seer forbade him to pass, for he said that the Dioskouroi were
seated on the tree. Aristomenes, in the heat of passion, did not hear
all that the seer said, and when he reached the tree, lost his shield,
and his disobedience gave to the Lacedaemonians an opportunity for some
to escape from the rout. For he lost time trying to recover his shield.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.6">

The Lacedaemonians were thrown into despair after this blow and purposed
to put an end to the war. But Tyrtaeus by reciting his poems contrived
to dissuade them, and filled their ranks from the Helots to replace the
slain. When Aristomenes returned to Andania, the women threw ribbons and
flower blossoms over him, singing also a song which is sung to this day:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“To the middle of Stenyclerus’ plain and to the hilltop Aristomenes
followed after the Lacedaemonians.”

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.7">

He recovered his shield also, going to Delphi and descending into the
holy shrine of Trophonios at Lebadeia, as the Pythia ordered .
Afterwards he took the shield to Lebadeia and dedicated it, and I myself
have seen it there among the offerings. The device on it is an eagle
with both wings outspread to the rim. Now on his return from Boeotia
having learned of the shield at the shrine of Trophonios and recovered
it, he at once engaged in greater deeds.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.8">

Collecting a force of Messenians, together with his own picked troop, he
waited for night and went to a city of Laconia whose ancient name in
Homer’s <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Catalogue</span> is
Pharis,[^287] but is called Pharai by the Spartans and neighboring
people. Arriving here he killed those who offered resistance and
surrounding the cattle started to drive them off to Messene. On the way
he was attacked by Lacedaemonian troops under king Anaxandros, but put
them to flight and began to pursue Anaxandros; but he stopped the
pursuit when wounded in the buttocks with a javelin; he did not,
however, lose the loot which he was driving away.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.9">

After waiting only for the wound to heal, he was making an attack by
night on Sparta itself, but was deterred by the appearance of Helen and
of the Dioskouroi. But he lay in wait by day for the girls who were
performing the dances in honor of Artemis at Caryae, and capturing those
who were wealthiest and of noblest birth, carried them off to a village
in Messenia, entrusting them to men of his troop to guard, while he
rested for the night.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.16.10">

There the young men, intoxicated, I suppose, and without any
self-control, attempted to violate the girls. When Aristomenes attempted
to deter them from an action contrary to Greek usage, they paid no
attention, so that he was compelled to kill the most disorderly. He
released the captives for a large ransom, still virgins, as when he
captured them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.1">

There is a place Aigila in Laconia, where is a sanctuary sacred to
Demeter. Aristomenes and his men knowing that the women were keeping
festival there … the women were inspired by the goddess to defend
themselves, and most of the Messenians were wounded with the knives with
which the women sacrificed the victims and the spits on which they
pierced and roasted the meat. Aristomenes was struck with the torches
and taken alive. Nevertheless he escaped to Messenia during the same
night. Arkhidameia, the priestess of Demeter, was charged with having
released him, not for a bribe but because she had been in love with him
before; but she maintained that Aristomenes had escaped by burning
through his bonds.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.2">

In the third year of the war, when an engagement was about to take place
at what is called The Great Trench, and the Messenians had been joined
by Arcadians from all the cities, the Lacedaemonians bribed Aristocrates
\[Aristokrates\] the son of Hicetas of Trapezus, who was then king and
general of the Arcadians. The Lacedaemonians were the first of whom we
know to give bribes to an enemy, and the first to make victory in war a
matter of purchase.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.3">

Before the Lacedaemonians committed this crime in the Messenian war in
the matter of the treachery of Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] the
Arcadian, the decision in battle was reached by valor and the fortunes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tukhai</span>\] emanating from
the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]. Again
it is clear that at a later date, when they were lying opposite the
Athenian fleet at Aigospotamoi, the Lacedaemonians bought Adeimantos and
other Athenian generals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.4">

However in course of time the punishment of Neoptolemos, as it is
called, came upon the Lacedaemonians themselves in their turn. Now it
was the fate of Neoptolemos the son of Achilles, after killing Priam on
the altar of Zeus Herkeios (Of the Courtyard), himself to be slain by
the altar of Apollo in Delphi. Thenceforward to suffer what a man has
himself done to another is called the Punishment of Neoptolemos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.5">

So in the case of the Lacedaemonians, when they were at the height of
their power after the destruction of the Athenian fleet, and Agesilaos
had already reduced the greater part of Asia, they were unable to
capture the whole empire of the Persians but the barbarian overreached
them with their own invention, sending money to Corinth, Argos, Athens
and Thebes as the result of this bribery the so-called Corinthian war
broke out, compelling Agesilaos to abandon his conquests in Asia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.6">

Thus the superhuman force \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ho
daimōn</span>\] was about to turn the trick employed by the
Lacedaemonians against the Messenians to their own destruction. After
receiving the money from Lacedaemon, Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\]
concealed his plot from the Arcadians for the present, but when they
were about to come into action, he alarmed them by saying that they were
caught in a difficult place and there would be no means of retreat for
them, if defeated, also that the offerings had not been satisfactory. He
ordered everyone therefore to take to flight when he gave the signal.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.7">

When the Lacedaemonians were about to close and the Messenians were
occupied on their own front, then Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] withdrew
the Arcadians as the battle began, leaving the Messenian left and center
without troops. For the Arcadians occupied both positions, now that the
men of Elis were absent from the battle —so too the Argives and
Sikyonians. To complete his work Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] caused
his men to fly through the Messenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.8">

They were astounded at the unexpected state of affairs, and moreover
were thrown into confusion by the passage of the Arcadians through their
ranks, so that they almost forgot what lay before them; for instead of
the advance of the Lacedaemonians they watched the Arcadian retirement,
some begging them to stand by them, others cursing them for traitors and
scoundrels.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.9">

It was not difficult for the Lacedaemonians to surround the Messenians
thus isolated, and they won without trouble the easiest of victories.
Aristomenes and his men held together and tried to check the fiercest of
the Lacedaemonian assaults but, being few in number, were unable to
render much assistance. So great were the numbers of the people of the
Messenians slain that in lieu of their former thoughts of becoming the
masters instead of the slaves of the Lacedaemonians they now despaired
of safety itself. Among the chieftains killed were Androkles and
Phintas, and Phanas after the most glorious resistance. He had
previously been victorious in the long foot-race at Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.10">

Aristomenes collected the Messenian survivors after the battle and
persuaded them to abandon Andania and most of the other towns that lay
in the interior and to settle on Mount Eira. When they had been driven
to this spot, the Lacedaemonians sat down to besiege them, thinking that
they would soon reduce them. Nevertheless the Messenians maintained
their resistance for eleven years after the disaster at the Trench.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.17.11">

The length of the siege is proved by these lines of the poet Rhianus,
regarding the Lacedaemonians:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“In the folds of the white mountain were they encamped, for two and
twenty winters and green herbs.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Rhianus, unknown location.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

He reckons winters and summers, by ‘green herbs’ meaning the green wheat
or the time just before harvest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.18.1">

Settling on Eira and cut off from the rest of Messenia, except in so far
as the people of Pylos and Mothone maintained the coastal districts for
them, the Messenians plundered both Laconia and their own territory,
regarding it now as enemy country. The men taking part in the raids were
drawn from all sources, and Aristomenes raised the number of his chosen
troop to three hundred.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.18.2">

They harried and plundered whatever Lacedaemonian property they could;
when wheat, cattle and wine were captured, they were consumed, but
movable property and men were sold. The Lacedaemonians, as their labors
were more profitable to the men at Eira than to themselves, accordingly
resolved that Messenia and the neighboring part of Laconia should be
left uncultivated during the war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.18.3">

As a result scarcity arose in Sparta, and with it revolution. For those
who had property here could not endure its lying idle. Their differences
were being composed by Tyrtaeus, when Aristomenes and his troop,
starting in the late evening and by rapid movement reaching Amyklai
before sunrise, captured and plundered the town, retiring before a force
from Sparta could come to its relief.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.18.4">

He continued to overrun the country afterwards, until in an engagement
with more than half the Lacedaemonian infantry and both the kings he
received various wounds while defending himself and was struck on the
head by a stone, so that his eyes became dizzy. When he fell a number of
the Lacedaemonians closed upon him and took him alive with some fifty of
his followers. The Lacedaemonians resolved to fling them all into the
Ceadas, into which they throw men punished for the greatest crimes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.18.5">

The rest of the Messenians were killed at once as they fell, but
Aristomenes now as on other occasions was preserved by one of the gods.
His panegyrists say that, when Aristomenes was thrown into the Ceadas,
an eagle flew below him and supported him with its wings, bringing him
to the bottom without any damage to his body and without wound. Even
from here, as it seems, the superhumsn-force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] was about to
show him a means of escape.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.18.6">

For when he came to the bottom of the chasm he lay down, and covering
himself with his cloak awaited the death that fate had surely decreed.
But after two days he heard a noise and uncovered, and being by this
time able to see through the gloom, saw a fox devouring the dead bodies.
Realizing that the beast must have some entrance, he waited for the fox
to come near him, and then seized it. Whenever it turned on him he used
one hand to hold out his cloak for it to bite. For the most part he kept
pace with it as it ran, but over the more difficult ground he was
dragged along by it. At last he saw a hole big enough for a fox to get
through and daylight showing through it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.18.7">

The fox, when released by Aristomenes, made of presumably, to its earth.
But Aristomenes enlarged the hole, which was not large enough to let him
through, with his hands and reached his home at Eira in safety, having
undergone a remarkable chance in the matter of his capture, for his
courage and prowess were so high that no one would have expected
Aristomenes to be made a prisoner. Still more remarkable, and a
convincing example of divine assistance, was his escape from the Ceadas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.19.1">

The Lacedaemonians at once received information from deserters that
Aristomenes had returned in safety. Though they thought it as incredible
as the news that anyone had risen from the dead, their belief was
ensured by the following action on the part of Aristomenes himself. The
Corinthians were sending a force to assist the Lacedaemonians in the
reduction of Eira.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.19.2">

Learning from his scouts that their march discipline was lax and that
their encampments were made without precaution, Aristomenes attacked
them by night. He slew most of them while the rest were still sleeping,
and killed the leaders Hypermenides, Achladaeus, Lysistratos and
Sidektos. And having plundered the generals’ tent, he made it clear to
the Spartans that it was Aristomenes and no other Messenian who had done
this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.19.3">

He also made the sacrifice called the Offering for the hundred slain to
Zeus of Ithome. This was an old-established custom, all Messenians
making it who had slain their hundred enemies. Aristomenes first offered
it after the battle at the Boar’s Tomb, his second offering was
occasioned by the slaughter of the Corinthians in the night. It is said
that he made a third offering as the result of his later raids.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.19.4">

Now the Lacedaemonians, as the festival of Hyakinthos was approaching,
made a truce of forty days with the men of Eira. They themselves
returned home to keep the feast, but some Cretan archers, whom they had
summoned as mercenaries from Lyktos and other cities, were patrolling
Messenia for them. Aristomenes then, in view of the truce, was at a
distance from Eira and was advancing somewhat carelessly, when seven of
these archers laid an ambush for him. They captured him and bound him
with the thongs which they had on their quivers, as evening was coming
on.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.19.5">

So two of them went to Sparta, bringing the glad news that Aristomenes
had been captured. The rest went to one of the farms in Messenia, where
there dwelled a fatherless girl with her mother. On the previous night
the girl had seen a dream. Wolves brought a lion to their farm bound and
without talons; but she herself loosed the lion from his bonds and found
and gave to him his talons, and thus it seemed that the wolves were torn
in pieces by the lion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.19.6">

And now when the Cretans brought in Aristomenes, the girl realized that
the dream of the night had come true, and asked her mother who he was.
On learning she was encouraged, and looking intently at him understood
what she had been bidden to do. Accordingly she plied the Cretans with
wine, and when they were overcome with drunkenness she stole away the
dagger of the man who was sleeping most heavily. Then the girl cut the
bonds of Aristomenes, and he took the sword and despatched the men. This
girl was taken to wife by Gorgos the son of Aristomenes. Aristomenes
gave him to the girl as a recompense for saving his life, for Gorgos had
not yet completed his eighteenth year when he wedded her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.1">

But in the eleventh year of the siege it was fated that Eira should be
taken and the Messenians dispersed, and the god fulfilled for them an
oracle given to Aristomenes and Theoklos. They had come to Delphi after
the disaster at the Trench and asked concerning safety, receiving this
reply from the Pythia:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Whensoever a he-goat drinks of Neda’s winding stream, no more do I
protect Messene, for destruction is at hand.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.2">

The springs of the Neda are in Mount Lykaios. The river flows through
the land of the Arcadians and turning again towards Messenia forms the
boundary on the coast between Messenia and Elis. Then they were afraid
of the he-goats drinking from the Neda, but it appeared that what the
god foretold to them was this. Some of the Greeks call the wild fig tree
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">olunthē</span>, but the
Messenians themselves
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tragos</span> \[‘he-goat’\]. Now
at that time a wild fig tree growing on the bank of the Neda had not
grown straight up, but was bending towards the stream and touching the
water with the tips of its leaves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.3">

When the seer Theoklos saw it, he guessed that the goat who drinks of
the Neda foretold by the Pythia was this wild fig tree, and that their
fate had already come upon the Messenians. He kept it secret from the
rest, but led Aristomenes to the fig tree and showed him that their time
of safety had gone by. Aristomenes believed that it was so and that
there was no delaying their fate, and made provision such as
circumstances demanded.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.4">

For the Messenians possessed a secret thing. If it were destroyed,
Messene would be overwhelmed and lost forever, but if it were kept, the
oracles of Lykos the son of Pandion said that after lapse of time the
Messenians would recover their country. Aristomenes, knowing the
oracles, took it towards nightfall, and coming to the most deserted part
of Ithome, buried it on the mountain, calling on Zeus who keeps Ithome
and the gods who had hitherto protected the Messenians to remain
guardians of the pledge, and not to put their only hope of return into
the power of the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.5">

After this, as formerly for the Trojans, the beginning of the Messenian
misfortunes was in adultery. The Messenians commanded the mountain of
Eira and its slopes as far as the Neda, some of them having their
dwellings outside the gates. The only deserter that came to them from
Laconia was a herdsman, slave of Emperamus, bringing his master’s
cattle. Emperamus was a man of repute in Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.6">

This herdsman, who kept his cattle not far from the Neda, saw the wife
of one of the Messenians, who had their dwellings outside the wall, as
she came to draw water. Falling in love with her, he dared to speak with
her and seduced her with gifts. Thenceforward he marked the time when
her husband went away to mount guard, garrison duty on the acropolis
being undertaken by the Messenians in turn. For it was at this point
that they were most afraid of the enemy making their way into the town.
Whenever he went away, then the herdsman used to visit the lady.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.7">

Now once when it happened that the turn for duty fell to him and others
in the night, it chanced that there was heavy rain, and the Messenians
deserted their post. For they were overcome by the density of the rain
that streamed from the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\], as there
were no battlements or towers erected on the wall owing to the hurried
nature of its building; moreover they did not expect the Lacedaemonians
even to stir on a moonless night that was so stormy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.8">

A few days earlier a merchant from Cephallenia, who was a friend of
Aristomenes and was bringing to Eira all that they needed, had been
captured by the Lacedaemonians and archers from Aptera, commanded by
Euryalus the Spartan; Aristomenes rescued him and recovered all the
goods that he was bringing, but had himself been wounded and was unable
to visit rounds, as was his custom. This was the main reason that the
acropolis was deserted.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.9">

All of them left their posts and with them the husband of the woman
seduced by the herdsman. She was entertaining the herdsman at the time
but heard her husband coming and at once hid the man away as quickly as
possible. When the husband entered, she treated him with greater
affection than ever before and asked him what was the reason of his
return. But knowing that she was unfaithful or that the herdsman was in
the house, he told her the truth, that owing to the violence of the rain
he and all the rest had deserted their post.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.20.10">

The herdsman listened to him speaking, and learning the exact position,
again deserted from the Messenians to the Lacedaemonians. The Kings were
absent at the time from the Lacedaemonian camp, but Emperamus, his
master, who was commandant, was conducting the siege of Eira. Coming to
him he first begged forgiveness for his crime of deserting and then
showed him that now was the time for them to take Eira, recounting
everything that he had learned from the Messenian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.1">

His story seemed to be reliable, and he led the way for Emperamus and
the Spartans. Their march was difficult, as it was dark and the rain
never ceased. Nevertheless they accomplished it in their eagerness, and
arriving before the acropolis of Eira, mounted by raising ladders and in
any other way that was possible. Various indications of the trouble that
was upon them were given to the Messenians, especially by the dogs
barking, not in their usual fashion, but uttering more loud and
continuous howls. realizing that the supreme and most desperate crisis
had come upon them, they did not wait to collect all their arms but
snatched whatever lay ready to the hand of each, to defend the
fatherland that alone was left to them of all Messenia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.2">

The first to realize that the enemy were within and to go against them
were Gorgos the son of Aristomenes, Aristomenes himself, Theoklos the
seer and Mantiklos his son, and with them Euergetidas a man of high
repute in Messenia who had attained to greater honor through his wife
for he was wedded to Hagnagora, the sister of Aristomenes. Then the
rest, though understanding that they were caught as in a net,
nevertheless derived some hope even from their present plight.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.3">

But Aristomenes and the seer knew that there was no putting off
destruction for the Messenians, for they knew the riddle of the oracle
which the Pythia had uttered concerning the goat. Nevertheless they
would not declare it, and kept it secret from the rest. As they hastened
through the city, visiting all, they exhorted those whom they
encountered, when they saw that they were Messenians, to be brave men,
and summoned from the houses those who still remained.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.4">

During the night nothing worthy of mention was done on either side; for
their ignorance of the ground and the daring of Aristomenes gave pause
to the Lacedaemonians, while the Messenians had not previously received
a watchword from their generals, and the rain would put out torches or
any other light that they kindled.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.5">

When it was day and they could see one another Aristomenes and Theoklos
tried to rouse the fury of despair in the Messenians, setting forth all
that suited the occasion and reminding them of the valor of the men of
Smyrna, how, though an Ionian people, by their valor and courage they
had driven out Cyges the son of Dascylus and the Lydians, when they were
in occupation of their town.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.6">

The Messenians, when they heard, were filled with desperate courage, and
mustering as they happened to be gathered rushed on the Lacedaemonians.
Women too were eager to fling tiles and what they could upon the enemy,
yet the violence of the rain prevented them from doing this and from
mounting to the house-tops. But they dared to take arms, and they too
further inflamed the ardor of the men, when they saw their women
preferring to perish with their fatherland rather than be taken as
slaves to Lacedaemon, so that they might yet have been able to escape
their fate.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.7">

But the god caused the rain to descend more densely, with loud claps of
thunder, and dazzled their eyes with lightning flashing in their faces.
All this put courage in the Lacedaemonians, who said that the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] himself was
helping them. And, as the lightning was on their right, Hekas the seer
declared the sign
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sēmeion</span>\] to be of good
omen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.8">

It was he who devised the following plan. The Lacedaemonians far
outnumbered the Messenians, but as the battle was not being fought on
open ground with troops in line, but they were fighting over different
quarters of the town, the rearmost of each detachment were rendered
useless. Hekas ordered these to retire to the camp, take food and sleep,
and return before evening to relieve their own men who were to remain on
duty.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.9">

The Lacedaemonians, by resting and fighting by turns, held out the
longer, but the Messenians were faced with difficulties on all sides.
They fought continuously day and night until the third day with none to
relieve them. When the next day dawned, worn out by lack of sleep and by
the rain and cold from the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\], they were
assailed by hunger and thirst. The women especially, unaccustomed to
war, were exhausted by the continuous suffering.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.10">

So the seer Theoklos came to Aristomenes’ side and said: “Why vainly
maintain this toil? The decree of fate stands fast that Messene should
fall; long since the Pythia declared to us the disaster now before our
eyes, and lately the fig tree revealed it. On me the gods have laid one
doom with my country, but do thou save the Messenians with what power
thou hast and save thyself.” When he had spoken to Aristomenes he rushed
upon the enemy, and these were the words that he was constrained to
fling at the Lacedaemonians. “Yet not for all time shall you enjoy the
fruits of Messenia with impunity.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.11">

Then falling upon the men who faced him he killed them and himself was
wounded, and having sated his passion with the slaughter of his foes, he
breathed his last. But Aristomenes called the Messenians back from the
fight, except those who by virtue of their courage were fighting to
cover them. These he allowed to remain at their post. The rest he
ordered to receive the women and children within their ranks and follow
him wherever he should show a passage.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.21.12">

He appointed Gorgos and Mantiklos to command the rear, he himself ran to
the head of the company and by the gestures of his head and movement of
his spear signified that he asked a passage and had resolved to depart.
Emperamus and the Spartans present were pleased to let the Messenians
pass, without further inflaming men who had reached the bounds of frenzy
and despair. Moreover Hekas the seer ordered them to act thus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.22.1">

As soon as the Arcadians heard of the Capture of Eira, they at once
ordered Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] to lead them to the rescue of the
Messenians or to death with them. But he, being in receipt of bribes
from Lacedaemon, refused to lead them, and said that he knew that no
Messenian survived for them to help.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.22.2">

When they obtained more certain news, that they survived and had been
forced to desert Eira, they themselves proposed to receive them at Mount
Lykaios after preparing clothing and food, and sent some of their
leading men to comfort the Messenians and also to be their guides on the
way. After their safe arrival at Mount Lykaios, the Arcadians
entertained them and treated them kindly in every way, offering to
distribute them among their towns and to make a new distribution of
their land on their account.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.22.3">

But Aristomenes’ grief for the sack of Eira and his hatred of the
Lacedaemonians suggested to him the following plan. He chose from the
body of the Messenians five hundred men whom he knew to be the most
unsparing of themselves, and asked them in the hearing of Aristocrates
\[Aristokrates\] and the rest of the Arcadians if they were ready to die
with him, avenging their country He did not know that Aristocrates
\[Aristokrates\] was a traitor, for he thought that he had fled from the
battle formerly from lack of courage and through cowardice, not for any
knavery; so he asked the five hundred in his presence.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.22.4">

When they said that they were ready, he revealed the whole plan, that he
proposed at all costs to lead them against Sparta during the following
evening. For now was the time when the majority of the Lacedaemonians
was away at Eira, and others were scouring Messenia for loot and
plunder. “If we can capture and occupy Sparta,” said Aristomenes, “we
can give back to the Lacedaemonians what is theirs and receive our own.
If we fail, we shall die together, having done a deed for posterity to
remember.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.22.5">

When he said this, as many as three hundred of the Arcadians were ready
to share his enterprise. For the time they delayed their departure, as
the victims were unfavorable, but on the following day they learned that
the Lacedaemonians had been forewarned of their secret, and that they
themselves had been a second time betrayed by Aristocrates
\[Aristokrates\]. For Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] had at once written
the designs of Aristomenes in a letter, and having entrusted it to the
slave whom he knew to be most loyal, sent him to Anaxandros in Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.22.6">

As the slave was returning, he was intercepted by some of the Arcadians,
who had formerly been at variance with Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] and
regarded him then with some suspicion. Having intercepted the slave they
brought him before the Arcadians and made known to the people the answer
from Lacedaemon. Anaxandros was writing that his retreat from the Great
Trench formerly had not gone unrewarded on the part of the
Lacedaemonians and that he would receive an additional recompense for
his information on the present occasion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.22.7">

When this was declared to all, the Arcadians themselves stoned
Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] and urged the Messenians to join them.
They looked to Aristomenes. But he was weeping, with his eyes fixed on
the ground. So the Arcadians stoned Aristocrates \[Aristokrates\] to
death and flung him beyond their borders without burial, and set up a
tablet in the precinct of Zeus Lykaios with the words:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Truly time hath declared justice upon an unjust king and with the help
of Zeus hath easily declared the betrayer of Messene.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Hard it is for a man forsworn to hide from God.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Hail, king Zeus, and keep Arcadia safe.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.1">

All the Messenians, who were captured about Eira or anywhere else in
Messenia, were reduced by the Lacedaemonians to serfdom. The people of
Pylos and Mothone and all who occupied the maritime district retired in
ships on the capture of Eira to Cyllene, the port of the Eleians. Thence
they sent to the Messenians in Arcadia, proposing to unite their forces
and seek a new country to dwell in, enjoining Aristomenes to lead them
to a colony.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.2">

But he said that while he lived, he would make war on the
Lacedaemonians, as he knew well that trouble would always be brewing for
Sparta through him, but he gave them Gorgos and Mantiklos as leaders.
Euergetidas too had retired to Mount Lykaios with the rest of the
Messenians. From there, when he saw that Aristomenes’ plan to seize
Sparta had failed, he persuaded some fifty of the Messenians to go back
with him to Eira and attack the Lacedaemonians,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.3">

and coming upon them while they were still plundering, he turned their
celebrations of victory to grief. He then met his doom there, but
Aristomenes ordered all the Messenians who wished to take part in the
colony to join the leaders at Cyllene. And all took part except those
debarred by age or lack of funds for journeying abroad. These remained
here with the Arcadians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.4">

Eira was taken, and the second war between the Lacedaemonians and
Messenians completed in the year when Autosthenes was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, and
in the first year of the twenty-eighth Olympiad,[^288] when Khionis the
Laconian was victorious.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.5">

When the Messenians assembled at Cyllene, they resolved to winter there
for that season, the Eleians providing a market and funds. With the
spring they began to debate where they should go. It was the view of
Gorgos that they should occupy Zacynthos off Cephallenia, becoming
islanders instead of mainlanders, and raid the coasts of Laconia with
their ships and ravage the land. But Mantiklos ordered them to forget
Messene and their hatred of the Lacedaemonians, and sail to Sardinia and
win an island which was of the largest extent and greatest fertility.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.6">

Meantime Anaxilas sent to the Messenians and summoned them to Italy. He
was tyrant of Rhēgion, third in descent from Alcidamidas, who had left
Messene for Rhēgion after the death of king Aristodemos and the capture
of Ithome. So now this Anaxilas summoned the Messenians. When they came,
he said that the people of Zancle were at war with him, and that they
possessed a prosperous land and city well placed in Sicily; and these he
said he was ready to give them and help them to conquer. When they
accepted the proposal, Anaxilas then transported them to Sicily.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.7">

Zancle was originally occupied by pirates, who, as the land was
uninhabited, walled off the harbor and used it as a base for their raids
and cruises. Their leaders were Crataemenes a Samian and Perieres of
Khalkis. Later Perieres and Krataimenes resolved to introduce other
Greek settlers.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.8">

Anaxilas defeated the Zanclaeans, when they put to sea to oppose him,
and the Messenians did the like by land, and the Zanclaeans, blockaded
on land by the Messenians and from the sea by the fleet of the Rhegines,
when their wall was carried, fled for refuge to the altars of the gods
and to the temples. Anaxilas, however, advised the Messenians to put to
death the suppliant Zanclaeans and to enslave the rest together with the
women and children.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.9">

But Gorgos and Mantiklos besought Anaxilas not to compel them, the
victims of unholy treatment at the hands of kinsmen, to behave as men
who belong to Greek \[Hellenic\] lineage. After this they made the
Zanclaeans rise from the altars, and exchanging pledges with them,
dwelled together in common. They changed the name of the city from
Zancle to Messene.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.23.10">

This event took place in the twenty-ninth Olympiad,[^289] when Khionis
the Laconian was victorious for the second time. Miltiades was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens.
Mantiklos founded the temple of Hēraklēs for the Messenians; the temple
of the god is outside the walls and he is called Hēraklēs Mantiklos,
just as Ammon in Libya and Belus in Babylon are named, the latter from
an Egyptian, Belus the son of Libya, Ammon from the shepherd-founder.
Thus the exiled Messenians reached the end of their wanderings.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.24.1">

After declining the leadership of the men setting forth to found a
colony, Aristomenes gave his sister Hagnagora in marriage to Tharyx at
Phigalia, and his daughters, both the eldest and the next in age, to
Damothoidas of Lepreum and Theopompos of Heraia. He himself went to
Delphi to enquire of the god. The reply that was given to Aristomenes is
not recorded,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.24.2">

but when Damagetos the Rhodian, who reigned at Ialysos, came to Apollo
and asked whence he should take a wife, the Pythia ordered him to take a
daughter of the bravest of the Greeks. As Aristomenes had a third
daughter, he married her, considering that Aristomenes was by far the
bravest of the Greeks of that age. Aristomenes, coming to Rhodes with
his daughter, purposed to go up from there to Sardis to Ardys the son of
Gyges, and to Ecbatana of the Medes to king Phraortes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.24.3">

But ere that he was overtaken by illness and death, for no further
misfortune was to befall the Lacedaemonians at the hands of Aristomenes.
On his death Damagetos and the Rhodians built him a splendid tomb and
paid honor to him thenceforward. I omit what is recorded of the
Diagoridai in Rhodes, as they are called, a line sprung from Diagoras
the son of Damagetos, son of Dorieus, who was the son of Damagetos and
of the daughter of Aristomenes, lest it should seem to be irrelevant.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.24.4">

Now the Lacedaemonians, gaining possession of Messenia, divided it all
among themselves, except the land belonging to the people of Asine; but
they gave Mothone to the men of Nauplia, who had recently been driven
from their town by the Argives.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.24.5">

The Messenians who were captured in the country, reduced by force to the
position of serfs, were later moved to revolt from the Lacedaemonians in
the seventy-ninth Olympiad,[^290] when Xenophon the Corinthian was
victorious. Arkhimedes was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens. The
occasion which they found for the revolt was this. Certain
Lacedaemonians who had been condemned to death on some charge fled as
suppliants to Taenarum but the board of ephors dragged them from the
altar there and put them to death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.24.6">

As the Spartans paid no heed to their being suppliants, the wrath of
Poseidon came upon them, and the god razed all their city to the ground.
At this disaster all the serfs who were of Messenian origin seceded to
Mount Ithome. Against them the Lacedaemonians, amongst other allies,
called to their assistance Kimon the son of Miltiades, their patron in
Athens, and an Athenian force. But when the Athenians arrived, they seem
to have regarded them with suspicion that they were likely to promote
revolution, and as a result of this suspicion to have soon dismissed
them from Ithome.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.24.7">

The Athenians, realizing the feelings of the Lacedaemonians towards
them, made friends therefore with the Argives, and gave Naupaktos to the
Messenians besieged in Ithome, when they were allowed to depart under a
truce. They had taken Naupaktos from the people of the land of Lokris
called the Ozolian, adjoining Aetolia. The retirement of the Messenians
from Ithome was secured by the strength of the place; also the Pythia
announced to the Lacedaemonians that assuredly they would be punished if
they committed a crime against the suppliant of Zeus of Ithome. For this
reason then they were allowed to go from Peloponnese under a truce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.1">

When they occupied Naupaktos it was not enough for them to have received
a city and country at the hands of the Athenians, but they were filled
with a strong desire to show they had won something notable with their
own hands. Knowing that the Acarnanians of Oiniadai possessed a good
land and were continually at war with the Athenians, they marched
against them. They had no numerical advantage, but defeating them by
their superior courage, they shut them up in the fortress and besieged
them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.2">

They neglected no human invention in the matter of siege-craft, tried to
carry the town by raising scaling-ladders, mined the walls, and by
bringing up such engines as could be made ready at short notice
proceeded with the destruction of the fortifications. The inhabitants,
fearing that if the city were taken they would be put to death and their
wives and children enslaved, elected to withdraw on terms.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.3">

The Messenians held the town and occupied the country for about a year.
In the following year the Acarnanians collected a force from all their
towns and discussed an attack on Naupaktos. They rejected this, as they
saw that their line of march would be through the Aetolians, who were
always their enemies; moreover they suspected that the men of Naupaktos
possessed a fleet, which was the fact; and while they commanded the sea,
it was impossible to achieve anything of importance with a land force.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.4">

So they changed their plans and at once turned on the Messenians in
Oiniadai and prepared to besiege them, for they never supposed that men
so few in number would show such desperate courage as to fight against
the full levy of the Acarnanians. The Messenians had previously prepared
food and all else that was requisite, expecting to stand a long siege.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.5">

But they were determined before the siege was formed to fight a battle
in the open, and being Messenians, who had not been surpassed in valor
even by Lacedaemonians, but in fortune only, were determined not to be
dismayed at the horde which had come from Acarnania. They recalled the
achievement of the Athenians at Marathon, how thirty myriad Persians had
been destroyed by men not numbering ten thousand.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.6">

So they joined battle with the Acarnanians, and the course of the battle
is said to have been thus. The enemy, being far superior in numbers, had
no difficulty in surrounding the Messenians, except where prevented by
the gates in the Messenian rear and by the zealous help of their men
posted on the wall. Here they could not be surrounded, hut the
Acarnanians enveloped both their flanks and shot volleys at them from
all sides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.7">

The Messenians, in close formation, whenever they charged the
Acarnanians in a body, threw the enemy at that point into confusion,
killing and wounding many of them, but they could not effect a complete
rout. For wherever the Acarnanians saw a part of their own line being
broken by the Messenians they went to the support of their harassed
troops at this point and checked the Messenians, overwhelming them by
numbers.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.8">

The Messenians, beaten back and again attempting to pierce the massed
troops of the Acarnanians at another point, would meet with the same
result. Wherever they attacked, they threw the enemy into confusion and
drove them a short distance, but as the Acarnanians again streamed
eagerly to this point, they were driven back against their will. The
battle was evenly contested until evening, but when at nightfall the
Acarnanians received reinforcements from their cities, the blockade of
the Messenians was formed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.9">

They had no fear of the wall being taken by assault, either by the
Acarnanians scaling it or by themselves being forced to abandon their
posts. But in the eighth month all their provisions alike had been
consumed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.25.10">

They shouted to the Acarnanians from the wall in mockery that their
supplies would not fail them until the tenth year of the siege, but they
themselves sallied out of Oiniadai at the time of the first sleep. Their
escape became known to the Acarnanians and they were compelled to fight,
losing some three hundred and killing still more of the enemy. But the
greater part of them got through the Acarnanians, and reaching the
territory of the Aetollans, who were their friends, arrived safely at
Naupaktos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.1">

Afterwards, as at all times, they were stirred by their hatred against
the Lacedaemonians, and provided the most striking example of their
hostility towards them in the war which took place between the
Peloponnesians and the Athenians. For they offered Naupaktos as a base
against Peloponnese, and Messenian slingers from Naupaktos helped to
capture the Spartans cut off in Sphakteria.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.2">

When the Athenian reverse at Aigospotamoi took place, the
Lacedaemonians, having command of the sea, then drove the Messenians
from Naupaktos; they went to their kinsmen in Sicily and to Rhēgion, but
the majority came to Libya and to the Euesperitai there, who had
suffered severely in war with barbarian neighbors and were inviting any
Greek to join them. So the majority of the Messenians went to them,
their leader being Komon, who had commanded them in Sphakteria.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.3">

A year before the victory of the Thebans at Leuktra, the superhuman
force \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] foretold
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pro-sēmainein</span>\] their
return to Peloponnese to the Messenians. It is said that in Messene on
the Straits the priest of Hēraklēs saw a vision in a dream: it seemed
that Hēraklēs Mantiklos was bidden by Zeus as a guest to Ithome. Also
among the EuesperitaiComon dreamt that he lay with his dead mother, but
that afterwards she came to life again. He hoped that as the Athenians
had recovered their seapower, they would be restored to Naupaktos. But
the dream really indicated the recovery of Messene.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.4">

Not long afterwards the Lacedaemonians suffered at Leuktra the disaster
that had long been due. For at the end of the oracle given to
Aristodemos, who reigned over the Messenians, are the words:“Act as fate
wills, destruction comes on this man before that,” signifying that he
and the Messenians must suffer evil at the present, but that hereafter
destruction would overtake Lacedaemon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.5">

Then after their victory at Leuktra the Thebans sent messengers to
Italy, Sicily and to the Euesperitae, and summoned the Messenians to
Peloponnese from every other quarter where they might be, and they, with
longing for their country and through the hatred which had ever remained
with them for the Lacedaemonians, assembled quicker than could have been
expected.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.6">

To Epameinondas it seemed in no way easy to found a city that could
resist the Lacedaemonians, nor could he discover where in the land to
build it. For the Messenians refused to settle again in Andania and
Oechalia, because their disasters had befallen them when they dwelled
there. To Epameinondas in his difficulty it is said that an ancient man,
closely resembling a priest of Demeter, appeared in the night and said:
“My gift to thee is that thou shalt conquer whomsoever thou dost assail;
and when thou dost pass from men, Theban, I will cause thy name to be
unforgotten and give thee glory. But do thou restore to the Messenians
their fatherland and cities, for now the wrath of the Dioskouroi against
them hath ceased.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.7">

This he said to Epameinondas, and revealed this to Epiteles the son of
Aeschines, who had been chosen by the Argives to be their general and to
refound Messene. He was bidden by the dream, wherever he found yew and
myrtle growing on Ithome, to dig between them and recover the old woman,
for, shut in her bronze chamber, she was overcome and well-nigh
fainting. When day dawned, Epiteles went to the appointed place, and as
he dug, came upon a bronze urn.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.26.8">

He took it at once to Epameinondas, told him the dream and ordered him
to remove the lid and see what was within. Epameinondas, after sacrifice
and prayer to the vision that had appeared, opened the urn and having
opened it found some tin foil, very thin, rolled like a book. On it were
inscribed the mysteries of the Great Goddesses, and this was the pledge
deposited by Aristomenes. They say that the man who appeared to Epiteles
and Epameinondas in their sleep was Kaukon, who came from Athens to
Messene the daughter of Triopas at Andania.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.1">

The wrath of the sons of Tyndareus against the Messenians began before
the battle in Stenyclerus, and arose, I think, for the following reason.
Panormos and Gonippos of Andania, young men in the bloom of youth, were
close friends in all things, and marched together into battle and on
raids into Laconia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.2">

The Lacedaemonians were keeping a feast of the Dioskouroi in camp and
had turned to drinking and sports after the midday meal, when Gonippos
and Panormos appeared to them, riding on the finest horses and dressed
in white tunics and scarlet cloaks, with caps on their heads and spears
in their hands. When the Lacedaemonians saw them they bowed down and
prayed, thinking that the Dioskouroi themselves had come to their
sacrifice.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.3">

When once they had come among them, the youths rode right through them,
striking with their spears, and when many had been killed, returned to
Andania, having outraged the sacrifice to the Dioskouroi. It was this,
in my view, that roused the Dioskouroi to their hatred of the
Messenians. But now, as the dream declared to Epameinondas, the
Dioskouroi no longer opposed the return of the Messenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.4">

Epameinondas was most strongly drawn to the foundation by the oracles of
Bacis, who was inspired by the Nymphs and left prophecies regarding
others of the Greeks as well as the return of the Messenians:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Then indeed shall the bright bloom of Sparta perish and Messene again
shall be inhabited for all time.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

I have discovered that Bacis also told in what manner Eira would be
captured, and this too is one of his oracles:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“The men of Messene overcome by the thunder’s roll and spouting rain.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.5">

When the mysteries were recovered, all who were of the priestly family
set them down in books. As Epameinondas considered the spot where the
city of the Messenians now stands most convenient for the foundation, he
ordered enquiry to be made by the seers if the favor of the gods would
follow him here. When they announced that the offerings were auspicious,
he began preparations for the foundation, ordering stone to be brought,
and summoning men skilled in laying out streets and in building houses,
temples, and ring-walls.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.6">

When all was in readiness, victims being provided by the Arcadians,
Epameinondas himself and the Thebans then sacrificed to Dionysus and
Apollo IsMenios in the accustomed manner, the Argives to Argive Hērā and
Nemean Zeus, the Messenians to Zeus of Ithome and the Dioskouroi, and
their priests to the Great Goddesses and Kaukon. And together they
summoned heroes to return and dwell with them, first Messene the
daughter of Triopas, after her Eurytos, Aphareus and his children, and
of the sons of Hēraklēs Kresphontes and Aipytos. But the loudest summons
from all alike was to Aristomenes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.7">

For that day they were engaged in sacrifice and prayer, but on the
following days they raised the circuit of the walls, and within built
houses and the temples. They worked to the sound of music, but only from
Boeotian and Argive <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">auloi</span>
\[‘double-reeds’\], and the tunes of Sacadas and Pronomos were brought
into keen competition. The city itself was given the name Messene, but
they founded other towns. The men of Nauplia were not disturbed at
Mothone,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.8">

and they allowed the people of Asine to remain in their home,
remembering their kindness when they refused to join the Lacedaemonians
in the war against them. The men of Nauplia on the return of the
Messenians to Peloponnese brought them such gifts as they had, and while
praying continually to the gods for their return begged the Messenians
to grant protection to themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.9">

The Messenians returned to Peloponnese and recovered their own land two
hundred and eighty-seven years after the capture of Eira, in the year
when Dyskinetos was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens and
in the third year of the hundred and second Olympiad,[^291] when Damon
of Thourioi was victorious for the second time. It was no short time for
the Plataeans that they were in exile from their country, and for the
Delians when they settled in Adramyttion after being expelled from their
island by the Athenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.10">

The Minyae, driven by the Thebans from Orkhomenos after the battle of
Leuktra, were restored to Boeotia by Philip the son of Amyntas, as were
also the Plataeans. When Alexander had destroyed the city of the Thebans
themselves, Kassandros the son of Antipatros rebuilt it after a few
years. The exile of the Plataeans seems to have lasted the longest of
those mentioned, but even this was not for more than two generations.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.27.11">

But the wanderings of the Messenians outside the Peloponnese lasted
almost three hundred years, during which it is clear that they did not
depart in any way from their local customs, and did not lose their Doric
dialect, but even to our day they have retained the purest Doric in
Peloponnese.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.1">

After their return they had nothing to fear at first from the
Lacedaemonians. For the Lacedaemonians, restrained by fear of the
Thebans, submitted to the foundation of Messene and to the gathering of
the Arcadians into one city. But when the war of the people of Phokis,
or, as it is called, the Sacred War caused the Thebans to withdraw from
Peloponnese, the Lacedaemonians regained courage and could no longer
refrain from attacking the Messenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.2">

The Messenians maintained the war with the help of the Argives and
Arcadians, and asked the Athenians for help. They refused to join in an
attack on Laconia, but promised to render assistance in person if the
Lacedaemonians began war and invaded Messenia. Finally the Messenians
formed an alliance with Philip the son of Amyntas and the Macedonians;
it was this, they say, that prevented them from taking part in the
battle which the Greeks fought at Khaironeia. They refused, however, to
bear arms against the Greeks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.3">

After the death of Alexander, when the Greeks had raised a second war
against the Macedonians, the Messenians took part, as I have shown
earlier in my account of Attica.[^292] They did not join the Greeks
against the Gauls, as Kleonymos and the Lacedaemonians refused to grant
them a truce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.4">

Not long afterwards the Messenians occupied Elis, employing strategy and
daring alike. The Eleians in the earliest times were the most
law-abiding of the Peloponnesians, but when Philip the son of Amyntas
did all the harm to Greece that has been related, he also bribed the
leading men in Elis; the Eleians were divided by factions for the first
time and came to blows, it is said.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.5">

Henceforward it was likely to be more easy for quarrels to arise among
men whose counsels were divided on account of the Lacedaemonians, and
they arrived at civil war. Learning this, the Lacedaemonians were
preparing to assist their partisans in Elis. While they were being
organized in squadrons and distributed in companies, a thousand picked
Messenian troops arrived hurriedly at Elis with Laconian blazons on
their shields.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.6">

Seeing their shields, all the Laconising party in Elis thought their
supporters had arrived and received them into the fortress. But having
obtained admission in this way, the Messenians drove out the supporters
of the Lacedaemonians and made over the city to their own partisans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.7">

The trick is Homer’s, but the Messenians plainly imitated it
opportunely, for Homer represents Patroklos in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>[^293] clad in the arms
of Achilles, and says that the barbarians were filled with the belief
that it was Achilles attacking them, and that their front ranks were
thrown into confusion. Other stratagems are the invention of Homer, the
coming of the two Greek spies by night among the Trojans, instead of
one[^294] and later a man coming to Troy, who pretends to be a deserter
but actually is to find out their secrets.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.28.8">

Again, the Trojans who, through youth or years were not of fighting age,
he posted as garrison of the walls,[^295] while the men of military age
were encamped against the Greeks. The wounded Greeks in Homer arm the
fighting men, so that even they may not be altogether idle. Indeed
Homer’s ideas have proved useful to men in every matter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.1">

Not long after the affair at Elis, the Macedonians and Demetrios the son
of Philip, son of Demetrios,[^296] captured Messene. I have already, in
my account of Sikyon,[^297] narrated most of the crimes of Perseus
against Philip himself and against Demetrios the son of Philip. These
are the facts relating to the capture of Messene.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.2">

Philip was in need of money, and as it was necessary to raise it at all
costs, he sent Demetrios with a fleet to Peloponnese. He put in to one
of the less frequented harbors of the Argolid, and at once marched his
army by the shortest route to Messene. With an advance guard consisting
of all the light-armed troops who knew the road to Ithome, he succeeded
just before dawn in scaling the wall unnoticed at a point where it lay
between the city and the peak of Ithome.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.3">

When day dawned and the inhabitants had realized the danger that beset
them, they were at first under the impression that the Lacedaemonians
had forced an entry into the town, and attacked them more recklessly
owing to their ancient hatred. But when they discovered from their
equipment and speech that it was the Macedonians and Demetrios the son
of Philip, they were filled with great fear, when they considered the
Macedonian training in warfare and the good fortune which they saw that
they enjoyed in all their ventures.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.4">

Nevertheless the magnitude of the present evil caused them to display a
courage beyond their strength, also they were inspired with hope for the
best, since it seemed not without divine help that they had accomplished
their return to Peloponnese after so long an absence. So the Messenians
in the town went against the Macedonians full of courage, and the
garrison on the acropolis attacked from the high ground above.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.5">

In like manner the Macedonians, brave and experienced troops, at first
offered a firm resistance. But worn out by their march, attacked by the
men and bombarded with tiles and stones by the women, they took to
flight in disorder. The majority were pushed over the precipices and
killed, for Ithome is very steep at this point. A few escaped by
throwing away their arms.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.6">

The Messenians refrained at first from joining the Achaean league for
the following reason, I think. When Pyrrhos the son of Aiakidēs made war
on the Lacedaemonians, they came unasked to their assistance, and as a
result of this service a more peaceful disposition towards them came to
be established at Sparta. Therefore they were unwilling to revive the
feud by joining the league, which was openly declared the bitterest
enemy of the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.7">

I realize, as of course did the Messenians, that even without their
joining the league the policy of the Achaeans was hostile to the
Lacedaemonians. For the Argives and the Arcadian group formed not the
smallest element in the league. However, in the course of time they
joined the league. And not long afterwards Kleomenes the son of
Leonidas, son of Kleonymos, captured the Arcadian Megalopolis in
peace-time.[^298]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.8">

Of the people of Megalopolis who were caught in the city, some were
killed at the time of its capture, but Philopoimen the son of Kraugis
and all who withdrew with him (the number of the citizens who escaped is
said to have been more than two-thirds) were received by the Messenians,
who for the sake of the former services rendered by the Arcadians in the
time of Aristomenes and again at the founding of Messene now repaid the
like.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.9">

Such, it would seem, are the vicissitudes of human affairs, if in fact
the superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] granted that
the Messenians should in their turn preserve the Arcadians, and what is
still more surprising, that they should capture Sparta. For they fought
against Kleomenes at Sellasia and joined with Aratos and the Achaeans to
capture Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.10">

When the Lacedaemonians were rid of Kleomenes there rose to power a
tyrant Makhanidas, and after his death a second tyrant arose in Nabis.
As he plundered human property and robbed temples alike, he amassed vast
wealth in a short time and with it raised an army. This Nabis seized
Messene, but when Philopoimen and the people of Megalopolis arrived
during the same night,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.11">

the Spartan tyrant retired on terms. But the Achaeans after this, having
some quarrel with the Messenians, invaded them with all their forces and
ravaged most of the country. On a second occasion they mustered when the
wheat was ripe to invade Messenia. But Deinocrates, the head of the
government, who had been chosen to command the Messenians on that
occasion, compelled Lykortas and his force to retire without effecting
anything, by occupying beforehand the passes from Arcadia into Messenia
with the Messenians from the city and troops from the surrounding
districts that came to their assistance.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.12">

Philopoimen arrived with a few cavalry some time later than the force
with Lykortas and had been unable to obtain any news of it; the
Messenians, having the advantage of the high ground, defeated him and
took him alive. I will narrate the manner of Philopoimen's capture and
death in my account of Arcadia later.[^299] The Messenians, who were
responsible for his death, were punished and Messene was again brought
into the Achaean league.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.29.13">

Hitherto my account has dealt with the many sufferings of the
Messenians, how fate scattered them to the ends of the earth, far from
Peloponnese, and afterwards brought them safely home to their own
country. Let us now turn to a description of the country and cities.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.30.1">

There is in our time a city Abia in Messenia on the coast, some twenty
stadium-lengths distant from the Choerius valley. They say that this was
formerly called Ire and was one of the seven cities which Homer says
that Agamemnon promised to Achilles.[^300] When Hyllos and the Dorians
were defeated by the Achaeans, it is said that Abia, nurse of Glenus the
son of Hēraklēs, withdrew to Ire, and settling there built a temple to
Hēraklēs, and that afterwards for this reason Kresphontes, amongst other
honors assigned to her, renamed the city after Abia. There was a notable
temple of Hēraklēs here, and also of Asklepios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.30.2">

Pharai is seventy stadium-lengths distant from Abia. On the road is a
salt spring. The Emperor Augustus caused the Messenians of Pharai to be
incorporated in Laconia. The founder Pharis is said to have been the son
of Hermes and Phylodameia the daughter of Danaos. He had no male
children, but a daughter Telegone. Homer, tracing her descendants in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>,[^301] says that twins,
Crethon and Ortilokhos, were born to Diokles, Diokles himself being the
son of Ortilokhos son of Alpheios. He makes no reference to Telegone,
who in the Messenian account bore Ortilokhos to Alpheios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.30.3">

I heard also at Pharai that besides the twins a daughter Anticleia was
born to Diokles, and that her children were Nikomakhos and Gorgasus, by
Makhaon the son of Asklepios. They remained at Pharai and succeeded to
the kingdom on the death of Diokles. The power of healing diseases and
curing the maimed has remained with them to this day, and in return for
this, sacrifices and votive offerings are brought to their sanctuary.
The people of Pharai possess also a temple of Fortune (Tyche) and an
ancient image.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.30.4">

Homer is the first whom I know to have mentioned Fortune in his poems.
He did so in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Hymn to
Demeter</span>, where he enumerates the daughters of Okeanos, telling
how they played with Kore the daughter of Demeter, and making Fortune
one of them. The lines are:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“We all in a lovely meadow, Leucippe, Phaeno, Electre and Ianthe,
Melobosis and Tyche and Ocyrhoe with face like a flower.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Homeric Hymn to Demeter</span>
\[5\]420

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.30.5">

He said nothing further about this goddess being the mightiest of gods
in human affairs and displaying greatest strength, as in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> he represented Athena
and Enyo as supreme in war, and Artemis feared in childbirth, and
Aphrodite heeding the affairs of marriage.[^302] But he makes no other
mention of Fortune.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.30.6">

Boupalos[^303] a skillful temple-architect and carver of images, who
made the statue of Fortune at Smyrna, was the first whom we know to have
represented her with the celestial sphere
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polos</span>\] upon her head
and carrying in one hand the horn of Amaltheia, as the Greeks call it,
representing her functions to this extent. The poems of Pindar later
contained references to Fortune, and it is he who called her Supporter
of the City.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.31.1">

Not far from Pharai is a grove of Apollo Karneios and a spring of water
in it. Pharai is about six stadium-lengths from the sea. Eighty
stadium-lengths on the road which leads thence into the interior of
Messenia is the city of the Thuriatae, which they say had the name
Antheia in Homer’s poems.[^304] Augustus gave Thuria into the possession
of the Lacedaemonians of Sparta. For when Augustus was emperor of the
Romans, Antony, himself a Roman, made war upon him and was joined by the
Messenians and the rest of the Greeks, because the Lacedaemonians were
on the side of Augustus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.31.2">

For this reason Augustus punished the Messenians and the rest of his
adversaries, some more, some less. The people of Thuria left their town,
which lay originally on high ground, and came down to live in the plain.
Nevertheless the upper town is not entirely deserted, but there are
remains of the wall and a temple there, called the temple of the Syrian

On the road from Thuria towards Arcadia are the springs of the Pamisus,
at which little children find cures.

A road turns to the left from the springs, and after some forty
stadium-lengths is the city of the Messenians under Ithome. It is
enclosed not only by Mount Ithome, but on the side towards the Pamisos
by Mount Eva. The mountain is said to have obtained its name from the
fact that the Bacchic cry of “Evoe” was first uttered here by Dionysus
and his attendant women.

The Messenians possess a statue of Zeus the Savior in the marketplace
and a fountain Arsinoe. It received its name from the daughter of
Leukippos and is fed from a source called Clepsydra. There are
sanctuaries of the gods Poseidon and Aphrodite, and, what is most
deserving of mention, a statue of the Mother of the Gods, of Parian
marble, the work of Damophon,[^305] the artist who repaired the Zeus at
Olympia with extreme accuracy when the ivory parted. Honors have been
granted to him by the people of Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.31.7">

By Damophon too is the so-called Laphria at Messene. The cult came to be
established among them in the following way: Among the people of
Calydon, Artemis, who was worshipped by them above all the gods, had the
title Laphria, and the Messenians who received Naupaktos from the
Athenians, being at that time close neighbors of the Aetolians, adopted
her from the people of Calydon. I will describe her appearance in
another place \[= 7.18.8\]. The name Laphria spread only to the
Messenians and to the Achaeans of Patrai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.31.8">

But all cities worship Artemis of Ephesos, and individuals hold her in
honor above all the gods. The reason, in my view, is the renown of the
Amazons, who traditionally dedicated the image, also the extreme
antiquity of this sanctuary. Three other points as well have contributed
to her renown, the size of the temple, surpassing all buildings among
men, the eminence of the city of the Ephesians and the renown of the
goddess who dwells there.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.31.9">

The Messenians have a temple erected to Eileithuia with a stone statue,
and near by a hall of the Kouretes, where they make burned offerings of
every kind of living creature, thrusting into the flames not only cattle
and goats, but finally birds as well. There is a holy shrine of Demeter
at Messene and statues of the Dioskouroi, carrying the daughters of
Leukippos. I have already explained in an earlier passage[^306] that the
Messenians argue that the sons of Tyndareus belong to them rather than
to the Lacedaemonians.

The most numerous statues and the most worth seeing are to be found in
the sanctuary of Asklepios. For besides statues of the god and his sons,
and besides statues of Apollo, the Muses and Hēraklēs, the city of
Thebes is represented and Epameinondas the son of Kleommis, Fortune, and
Artemis Bringer of Light. The stone statues are the work of Damophon (I
know of no other Messenian sculptor of merit apart from him); the statue
of Epameinondas is of iron and the work of some other artist.

There is also a temple of Messene the daughter of Triopas with a statue
of gold and Parian marble. At the back of the temple are paintings of
the kings of Messene: before the coming of the Dorian host to
Peloponnese, Aphareus and his sons, after the return of the Herakleidai,
Kresphontes the Dorian leader, of the inhabitants of Pylos, Nestor,
Thrasymedes and Antilokhos, singled out from among the sons of Nestor on
the score of age and because they took part in the expedition to Troy.

There is Leukippos brother of Aphareus, Hilaeira and Phoebe, and with
them Arsinoe. Asklepios too is represented, being according to the
Messenian account a son of Arsinoe, also Makhaon and Podaleirios, as
they also took part in the affair at Troy. These pictures were painted
by Omphalion, pupil of Nikias[^307] the son of Nikomedes. Some say that
he was also a slave in the house of Nikias and his favorite.

The place called Hierothesion by the Messenians contains statues of all
the gods whom the Greeks worship, and also a bronze image of
Epameinondas. Ancient tripods are dedicated there, which ‘have felt not
the fire’, as Homer says.[^308] The statues in the gymnasium are the
work of Egyptian artists. They represent Hermes, Hēraklēs, and Theseus,
who are honored in the gymnasium and wrestling-ground according to a

I learned by enquiry that Aethidas was a man older than myself, who
gained influence through his wealth and is honored by the Messenians as
a hero. There are certain Messenians, who, while admitting that Aethidas
was a man of great wealth, maintain that it is not he who is represented
on the relief but an ancestor and namesake. The elder Aethidas was their
leader, when Demetrios the son of Philip and his force surprised them in
the night and succeeded in penetrating into the town unnoticed.

There is also the tomb of Aristomenes here. They say that it is not a
cenotaph, but when I asked whence and in what manner they recovered the
bones of Aristomenes, they said that they sent to Rhodes for them, and
that it was the god of Delphi who ordered it. They also instructed me in
the nature of the rites carried out at the tomb. The bull which is to be
offered to the dead man is brought to the tomb and bound to the pillar
which stands upon the tomb. Being fierce and unused to bonds he will not
stand; and if the pillar is moved by his struggles and bounds, it is a
good omen to the Messenians, but if the pillar is not moved the sign
portends misfortune.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.32.4">

They have it that Aristomenes was present at the battle of Leuktra,
though no longer among men, and say that he helped the Thebans and was
the chief cause of the Lacedaemonian disaster. I know that the
Chaldaeans and Indian sages were the first to say that the soul of man
is immortal, and have been followed by some of the Greeks, particularly
by Plato the son of Ariston. If all are willing to accept this, this too
cannot be denied, that his hatred for the Lacedaemonians was imparted to
Aristomenes for all time.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.32.5">

What I myself heard in Thebes gives probability to the Messenian
account, although it does not coincide in all respects. The Thebans say
that when the battle of Leuktra was imminent, they sent to other oracles
and to enquire of the god of Lebadeia. The replies of the Ismenian and
Ptoan Apollo are recorded, also the responses given at Abaiand at
Delphi. Trophonios, they say, answered in hexameters:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Or ever ye join battle with the foe, set up a trophy and deck it with
my shield, which impetuous Aristomenes the Messenian placed in my
temple. And I will destroy the host of foemen bearing shield.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.32.6">

When the oracle was brought, they say that Epameinondas urged
Xenocrates, who sent for the shield of Aristomenes and used it to adorn
a trophy in a spot where it could be seen by the Lacedaemonians. Those
of them who had seen the shield at Lebadeia in peace-time knew it, and
all knew it by repute. After their victory the Thebans restored the
offering to Trophonios. There is also a bronze statue of Aristomenes in
the Messenian running-ground. Not far from the theater is a sanctuary of
Sarapis and Isis.

On the ascent to the summit of Ithome, which is the Messenian acropolis,
is a spring Clepsydra. It is a hopeless task, however zealously
undertaken, to enumerate all the peoples who claim that Zeus was born
and brought up among them. The Messenians have their share in the story
for they too say that the god was brought up among them and that his
nurses were Ithome and Neda, the river having received its name from the
latter, while the former, Ithome, gave her name to the mountain. These
nymphs are said to have bathed Zeus here, after he was stolen by the
Kouretes owing to the danger that threatened from his father, and it is
said that it has its name from the Kouretes’ theft. Water is carried
every day from the spring to the sanctuary of Zeus of Ithome.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.33.2">

The statue of Zeus is the work of Ageladas[^309] and was made originally
for the Messenian settlers in Naupaktos. The priest is chosen annually
and keeps the image in his house.[^310] They keep an annual festival,
the Ithomaia, and originally a musical contest was held. This can be
gathered from the epic lines of Eumēlos and other sources. Eumēlos, in
his processional hymn to Delos, says:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“For dear to the God of Ithome was the Muse, whose \<lute\> is pure and

At the Arcadian gate leading to Megalopolis is a Herm of Attic style;
for the square form of Herm is Athenian, and the rest adopted it thence.
After a descent of thirty stadium-lengths from the gate is the
watercourse of Balyra. The river is said to have got its name from
Thamyris throwing
(<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ballein</span>) his lyre away
here after his blinding. He was the son of Philammon and the nymph
Argiope, who once dwelled on Parnassus, but settled among the
Odrysaiwhen pregnant, for Philammon refused to take her into his house.
Thamyris is called an Odrysian and Thracian on these grounds. The
watercourses Leucasia and Amphitos unite to form one stream.

When these are crossed, there is a plain called the plain of
Stenyclerus. Stenyclerus was a hero, it is said. Facing the plain is a
site anciently called Oechalia, in our time the Carnasian grove, thickly
grown with cypresses. There are statues of the gods Apollo Karneios
\<and Hagne\>, also Hermes carrying a ram. Hagne (the holy one) is a
title of Kore the daughter of Demeter. Water rises from a spring close
to the statue.

I may not reveal the rites of the Great Goddesses, for it is their

as second only to the Eleusinian in sanctity. But my dream did not
prevent me from making known to all that the bronze urn, discovered by
the Argive general, and the bones of Eurytos the son of Melaneus were
kept here. A river Kharadros flows past the grove;

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.33.6">

about eight stadium-lengths along the road to the left are the ruins of
Andania. The guides agree that the city got its name from a woman
Andania, but I can say nothing as to her parents or her husband. On the
road from Andania towards Cyparissiae is Polichne, as it is called, and
the streams of Electra and Coeus. The names perhaps are to be connected
with Electra the daughter of Atlas and Coeus the father of Leto, or
Electra and Coeus may be two local heroes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.33.7">

When the Electra is crossed, there is a spring called Achaea, and the
ruins of a city Dorion. Homer states[^311] that the misfortune of
Thamyris took place here in Dorion, because he said that he would
overcome the Muses themselves in song. But Prodicus of Phokaia, if the
epic called the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Minyad</span>[^312]
is indeed his, says that Thamyris paid the penalty in Hades for his
boast against the Muses. My view is that Thamyris lost his eyesight
through disease, as happened later to Homer. Homer, however, continued
making poetry all his life without giving way to his misfortune, while
Thamyris forsook his art through stress of the trouble that afflicted
him.

From Messene to the mouth of the Pamisus is a journey of eighty
stadium-lengths. The Pamisus is a pure stream flowing through cultivated
lands, and is navigable some ten stadium-lengths from the sea. Sea-fish
run up it, especially in spring, as they do up the Rhine and Maeander.
The chief run of fish is up the stream of the Akhelōos, which discharges
opposite the Echinades islands.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.34.2">

But the fish that enter the Pamisus are of quite a different kind, as
the water is pure and not muddy like the rivers which I have mentioned.
The grey mullet, a fish that loves mud, frequents the more turbid
streams. The rivers of Greece contain no creatures dangerous to men as
do the Indus and the Egyptian Nile, or again the Rhine and Danube, the
Euphrates and Phasis. These indeed produce man-eating creatures of the
worst, in shape resembling the catfish of the Hermos and Maeander, but
of darker color and stronger. In these respects the catfish is inferior.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.34.3">

The Indus and Nile both contain crocodiles, and the Nile river-horses as
well, as dangerous to man as the crocodile. But the rivers of Greece
contain no terrors from wild beasts, for the sharks of the Aous, which
flows through Thesprotia, are not river beasts but migrants from the
sea.

Korōnē is a city to the right of the Pamisus, on the sea-coast under
Mount Mathia. On this road is a place on the coast regarded as sacred to
Ino. For they say that she came up from the sea at this point, after her
divinity had been accepted and her name changed from Ino to Leucothea. A
short distance further the river Bias reaches the sea. The name is said
to be derived from Bias the son of Amythaon. Twenty stadium-lengths off
the road is the fountain of Plataniston, the water of which flows out of
a broad plane tree, which is hollow inside. The breadth of the tree
gives the impression of a small cave; from it the drinking water flows
to Corone.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.34.5">

The old name of Korōnē was Aipeia, but when the Messenians were restored
to Peloponnese by the Thebans, it is said that Epimelides, who was sent
as founder, named it Korōneia after his native town in Boeotia. The
Messenians got the name wrong from the start, and the mistake which they
made gradually prevailed in course of time. Another story is told to the
effect that, when digging the foundations of the city wall, they came
upon a bronze crow, in Greek
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">korōnē</span>.

The gods who have temples here are Artemis, called the “Nurse of

are of stone, but there is a statue of Zeus the Savior in the
marketplace made of bronze. The statue of Athena also on the acropolis
is of bronze, and stands in the open air, holding a crow in her hand. I

“the harbor of the Achaeans.”

Some eighty stadium-lengths beyond Korōnēis a sanctuary of Apollo on the

The city of Korōnēis adjoined by Colonides. The inhabitants say that
they are not Messenians but settlers from Attica brought by Kolainos,
who followed a bird known as the crested lark to found the settlement in

adopt the dialect and customs of the Dorians. The town of Colonides lies

The people of Asine originally adjoined the Lycoritaion Parnassus. Their
name, which they maintained after their arrival in Peloponnese, was
Dryopes, from their founder. Two generations after Dryops, in the reign
of Phylas, the Dryopes were conquered in battle by Hēraklēs and brought
as an offering to Apollo at Delphi. When brought to Peloponnese
according to the god’s instructions to Hēraklēs, they first occupied
Asine by Hermion. They were driven thence by the Argives and lived in
Messenia. This was the gift of the Lacedaemonians, and when in the
course of time the Messenians were restored, they were not driven from
their city by the Messenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.34.10">

But the people of Asine give this account of themselves. They admit that
they were conquered by Hēraklēs and their city in Parnassus captured,
but they deny that they were made prisoners and brought to Apollo. But
when the walls were carried by Hēraklēs, they deserted the town and fled
to the heights of Parnassus, and afterwards crossed the sea to
Peloponnese and appealed to Eurystheus. Being at feud with Hēraklēs, he
gave them Asine in the Argolid.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.34.11">

The men of Asine are the only members of the people known as the Dryopes
to pride themselves on the name to this day. The case is very different
with the Euboeans of Styra. They too are Dryopes in origin, who took no
part in the battle with Hēraklēs, as they dwelled at some distance from
the city. Yet the people of Styra disdain the name of Dryopes, just as
the Delphians have refused to be called people of Phokis. But the men of
Asine take the greatest pleasure in being called Dryopes, and clearly
have made the most holy of their sanctuaries in memory of those which
they once had, established on Parnassus. For they have both a temple of
Apollo and again a temple and ancient statue of Dryops, whose mysteries
they celebrate every year, saying that he is the son of Apollo.

The town itself lies on the coast just as the old Asine in Argive
territory. It is a journey of forty stadium-lengths from Colonides to
Asine, and of an equal number from Asine to the promontory called

Theganussa, lying off it. After Acritas is the harbor Phoinikos and the

Before the mustering of the army for the Trojan war, and during the war,
Mothone was called Pedasus. Later, as the people themselves say, it
received a new name from the daughter of Oineus. They say that Mothone
was born of a concubine to Oineus the son of Porthaon, when he had taken
refuge with Diomede in Peloponnese after the fall of Troy. But in my
view it was the rock Mothon that gave the place its name. It is this
which forms their harbor. For projecting under water, it makes the
entrance for ships more narrow and also serves as a breakwater against a
heavy swell.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.35.2">

I have shown in earlier passages[^313] that, when the Nauplians in the
reign of Damocratidas in Argos were expelled for their Laconian
sympathies, the Lacedaemonians gave them Mothone, and that no change was
made regarding them on the part of the Messenians when they returned.
The Nauplians in my view were Egyptians originally, who came by sea with
Danaos to the Argolid, and two generations later were settled in Nauplia
by Nauplios the son of Amymone.

The Emperor Trajan granted civic freedom and autonomy to the people of
Mothone. In earlier days they were the only people of Messenia on the
coast to suffer a disaster like the following: Thesprotian Epeiros was
ruined by anarchy. For Deidameia the daughter of Pyrrhos, being without
children, handed over the government to the people when she was on the
point of death. She was the daughter of Pyrrhos, son of Ptolemy, son of
Alexander, son of Pyrrhos.

When the people of Epeiros were rid of their kings, the people threw off
all control and disdained to listen to their magistrates, and the
Illyrians who live on the Ionian sea above Epeiros reduced them by a
raid. We have yet to hear of a democracy bringing prosperity to a nation
other than the Athenians; the Athenians attained to greatness by its
means, for they surpassed the Greek world in native wit, and least
disregarded the established laws.

Now the Illyrians, having tasted empire and being always desirous of
more, built ships, and plundering others whom they fell in with, put in
to the coast of Mothone and anchored as in a friendly port. Sending a
messenger to the city they asked for wine to be brought to their ships.
A few men came with it and they bought the wine at the price which the
inhabitants asked, and themselves sold a part of their cargo.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.35.7">

When on the following day a larger number arrived from the town, they
allowed them also to make their profit. Finally women and men came down
to the ships to sell wine and trade with the barbarians. Thereupon by a
bold stroke the Illyrians carried off a number of men and still more of
the women. Carrying them on board ship, they set sail for the Ionian
sea, having desolated the city of the Mothonaeans.

damaged by violent and unseasonable blasts, Diomede prayed to the

their country. There is also a shrine of Artemis here and water in a

the village with the name Dascylou Come, is warm and sweeter than milk
to drink. I know that Herodotus says that a spring of bitter water flows
into the river Hypanis. We can assuredly admit the truth of his

It is a journey of about a hundred stadium-lengths from Mothone to the
promontory of Coryphasium, on which Pylos lies. This was founded by
Pylos the son of Kleson, bringing from the Megarid the Leleges who then
occupied the country. But he did not enjoy it, as he was driven out by
Neleus and the Pelasgians of Iolcos, on which he departed to the
adjoining country and there occupied the Pylos in Elis. When Neleus
became king, he raised Pylos to such renown that Homer in his epics
calls it the city of Neleus.[^317]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.36.2">

It contains a sanctuary of Athena with the title Coryphasia, and a house
called the house of Nestor, in which there is a painting of him. His
tomb is inside the city; the tomb at a little distance from Pylos is
said to be the tomb of Thrasymedes. There is a cave inside the town, in
which it is said that the cattle belonging to Nestor and to Neleus
before him were kept.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.36.3">

These cattle must have been of Thessalian stock, having once belonged to
Iphiklos the father of Protesilaos. Neleus demanded these cattle as
bride gifts for his daughter from her suitors, and it was on their
account that Melampos went to Thessaly to gratify his brother Bias. He
was put in bonds by the herdsmen of Iphiklos, but received them as his
reward for the prophecies which he gave to Iphiklos at his request. So
it seems the men of those days made it their business to amass wealth of
this kind, herds of horses and cattle, if it is the case that Nestor
desired to get possession of the cattle of Iphiklos and that Eurystheus,
in view of the reputation of the Iberian cattle, ordered Hēraklēs to
drive off the herd of Geryones.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.36.4">

Eryx too, who was reigning then in Sicily, plainly had so violent a
desire for the cattle from Erytheia that he wrestled with Hēraklēs,
staking his kingdom on the match against these cattle. As Homer says in
the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>,[^318] a hundred
kine were the first of the bride gifts paid by Iphidamas the son of
Antenor to his bride’s father. This confirms my argument that the men of
those days took the greatest pleasure in cattle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.36.5">

But the cattle of Neleus were pastured for the most part across the
border, I think. For the country of the Pylians in general is sandy and
unable to provide so much grazing. Homer testifies to this, when he
mentions Nestor, always adding that he was king of sandy Pylos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.36.6">

The island of Sphakteria lies in front of the harbor just as Rheneia off
the anchorage at Delos. It seems that places hitherto unknown have been
raised to fame by the fortunes of men. For Caphereus in Euboea is famous
since the storm that here befell the Greeks with Agamemnon on their
voyage from Troy. Psyttaleia by Salamis we know from the destruction of
the Persians there. In like manner the Lacedaemonian reverse made
Sphakteria known to all mankind. The Athenians dedicated a bronze statue
of Victory also on the acropolis as a memorial of the events at
Sphakteria.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:4.36.7">

When Cyparissiae is reached from Pylos, there is a spring below the city
near the sea, the water of which they say gushed forth for Dionysus when
he struck he ground with a thyrsus. For this reason they call the spring
Dionysias. There is a shrine of Apollo in Cyparissiae and of Athena with
the title Cyparissia. In the depression called Aulon there is a temple
and statue of Asklepios Aulonios. Here flows the river Neda, forming the
boundary between Messenia and Elis.

The Greeks who say that the Peloponnesus has five, and only five,
divisions must agree that Arcadia contains both Arcadians and Eleians,
that the second division belongs to the Achaeans, and the remaining
three to the Dorians. Of the people dwelling in Peloponnesus the
Arcadians and Achaeans are aborigines. When the Achaeans were driven
from their land by the Dorians, they did not retire from Peloponnesus,
but they cast out the Ionians and occupied the land called of old
Aigialos, but now called Achaea from these Achaeans. The Arcadians, on
the other hand, have from the beginning to the present time continued in
possession of their own country.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.2">

The rest of Peloponnesus belongs to immigrants. The modern Corinthians
are the latest inhabitants of Peloponnesus, and in the era from my time
to the time when they received their land from the Roman Emperor is two
hundred and seventeen years. The Dryopians reached the Peloponnesus from
Parnassus, the Dorians from Oitē.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.3">

The Eleians we know crossed over from Calydon and Aetolia generally.
Their earlier history I found to be as follows. The first to rule in
this land, they say, was Aethlios, who was the son of Zeus and of
Protogeneia, the daughter of Deukalion, and the father of Endymion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.4">

The Moon, they say, fell in love with this Endymion and bore him fifty
daughters. Others with greater probability say that Endymion took a wife
Asterodia—others say she was Kromia, the daughter of Itonos, the son of
Amphiktyon; others again, Hyperippe, the daughter of Arkas—but all agree
that Endymion begot Paion, Epeios, Aitolos, and also a daughter
Eurukuda. Endymion set his sons to run a race at Olympia for the throne;
Epeios won, and obtained the kingdom, and his subjects were then named
Epeians for the first time.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.5">

Of his brothers they say that Aitolos remained at home, while Paion,
vexed at his defeat, went into the farthest exile possible and that the
region beyond the river Axios was named after him Paionia. As to the
death of Endymion, the people of Herakleia near Miletus do not agree
with the Eleians for while the Eleians show a tomb of Endymion, the folk
of Herakleia say that he retired to Mount Latmos and give him honor,
there being a shrine of Endymion on Latmos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.6">

Epeios married Anaxirhoe, the daughter of Koronos, and begot a daughter
Hyrmina, but no male issue. In the reign of Epeios the following events
also occurred. Oinomaos was the son of Alxion (though poets proclaimed
his father to be Ares, and the common report agrees with them), but
while lord of the land of Pisa, he was put down by Pelops the Lydian,
who crossed over from Asia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.7">

On the death of Oinomaos, Pelops took possession of the land of Pisa and
its bordering country Olympia, separating it from the land of Epeios.
The Eleians said that Pelops was the first to found a temple of Hermes
in Peloponnesus and to sacrifice to the god, his purpose being to avert
the wrath of the god for the death of Myrtilos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.8">

Aitolos, who came to the throne after Epeios, was made to flee from
Peloponnesus, because the children of Apis tried and convicted him of
unintentional homicide. For Apis, the son of Jason, from Pallantion in
Arcadia, was run over and killed by the chariot of Aitolos at the Games
held in honor of Azan. Aitolos, son of Endymion, gave to the dwellers
around the Akhelōos their name, when he fled to this part of the
mainland. But the kingdom of the Epeians fell to Eleios, the son of
Eurukuda, daughter of Endymion and, believe the tale who will, of
Poseidon. It was Eleios who gave the inhabitants their present name of
Eleians in place of Epeians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.9">

Eleios had a son Augeias. Those who exaggerate his glory give a turn to
the name Eleios and make Hēlios to be the father of Augeias. This
Augeias had so many cattle and flocks of goats that actually most of his
land remained uncultivated because of the manure produced by the
animals. Now he persuaded Hēraklēs to purify for him the land from dung,
either in return for a part of Elis or possibly for some other reward.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.10">

Hēraklēs accomplished this feat too, turning aside the stream of the
Menios into the manure. But because Hēraklēs had accomplished his task
by cunning, without toil, Augeias refused to give him his reward and
banished Phyleus, the elder of his two sons, for objecting that he was
wronging a man who had been his benefactor. He made preparations himself
to resist Hēraklēs, should he attack Elis; more particularly, he made
friends with the sons of Aktor and with Amarynkeus. Amarynkeus, besides
being a good soldier,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.1.11">

had a father, Pyttios, of Thessalian descent, who came from Thessaly to
Elis. To Amarynkeus, therefore, Augeias also gave a share in the
government of Elis; Aktor and his sons had a share in the kingdom and
were natives of the country. For the father of Aktor was Phorbas, son of
Lapithos, and his mother was Hyrmina, daughter of Epeios. Aktor named
after her the city of Hyrmina, which he founded in Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.2.1">

Hēraklēs accomplished no brilliant feat in the war with Augeias. For the
sons of Aktor were in the prime of courageous manhood and always put to
flight the allies under Hēraklēs, until the Corinthians proclaimed the
Isthmian truce, and the sons of Aktor came as envoys to the meeting.
Hēraklēs set an ambush for them at Kleonai and murdered them. As the
murderer was unknown, Moline, more than any of the other children,
devoted herself to detecting him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.2.2">

When she discovered him, the Eleians demanded satisfaction for the crime
from the Argives, for at the time Hēraklēs had his home at Tiryns. When
the Argives refused them satisfaction, the Eleians as an alternative
pressed the Corinthians entirely to exclude the Argive people from the
Isthmian Games. When they failed in this also, Moline is said to have
laid curses on her countrymen, should they refuse to boycott the
Isthmian festival. The curses of Moline are respected right down to the
present day, and it is a custom that no athlete competes in the Isthmian
Games.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.2.3">

There are two other accounts differing from the one that I have given.
According to one of them, Kypselos, the tyrant of Corinth, dedicated to
Zeus a golden image at Olympia. As Kypselos died before inscribing his
own name on the offering, the Corinthians asked of the Eleians leave to
inscribe the name of Corinth on it but were refused. Angry with the
Eleians, they proclaimed that they must keep away from the Isthmian
Games. But how could the Corinthians themselves take part in the Olympic
Games if the Eleians against their will were shut out by the Corinthians
from the Isthmian Games?

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.2.4">

The other account is this. Prolaos, a distinguished Eleian, had two
sons, Philanthos and Lampos, by his wife Lysippe. These two came to the
Isthmian Games[^319] to compete in the boys’ pankration, and one of them
intended to wrestle. Before they entered the ring, they were strangled
or done to death in some other way by their fellow competitors. Hence,
the curses of Lysippe on the Eleians, should they not voluntarily keep
away from the Isthmian Games. But this story too proves on examination
to be silly.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.2.5">

For Timon, a man of Elis, won victories in the pentathlon at the Greek
Games, and at Olympia, there is even a statue of him, with an elegiac
inscription giving the garlands he won and also the reason why he
secured no Isthmian victory. The inscription sets forth the reason thus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

But from going to the land of Sisyphus, he was hindered by a quarrel

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

About the baleful death of the Molionidai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.3.1">

Enough of my discussion of this question. Hēraklēs afterwards took Elis
and sacked it, with an army he had raised of Argives, Thebans and
Arcadians. The Eleians were aided by the men of Pisa and of Pylos in
Elis. The men of Pylos were punished by Hēraklēs, but his expedition
against Pisa was stopped by an oracle from Delphi that goes like this:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

My father cares for Pisa, but to me in the hollows of Pythō.[^320]

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

This oracle proved the salvation of Pisa. To Phyleus Hēraklēs gave up
the land of Elis and all the rest, more out of respect for Phyleus than
because he wanted to do so: he allowed him to keep the prisoners, and
Augeias to escape punishment.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.3.2">

The women of Elis, it is said, seeing that their land had been deprived
of its vigorous manhood, prayed to Athena that they might conceive at
their first union with their husbands. Their prayer was answered, and
they set up a sanctuary of Athena surnamed Mother. Both wives and
husbands were so delighted at their union that they named the place
itself where they first met, Badu \[sweet\], and the river that runs
thereby Badu Water, this being a word of their native dialect.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.3.3">

When Phyleus had returned to Doulikhion after organizing the affairs of
Elis, Augeias died at an advanced age, and the kingdom of Elis devolved
on Agasthenes, the son of Augeias, and on Amphimakhos and Thalpios. For
the sons of Aktor married twin sisters, the daughters of Dexamenos who
was king at Olenos; Amphimakhos was born to one son and Theronikē,
Thalpios to her sister Theraiphone and Eurytos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.3.4">

However, neither Amarynkeus himself nor his son Diores remained common
people. Incidentally this is shown by Homer[^321] in his list of the
Eleians; he makes their whole fleet to consist of forty ships, half of
them under the command of Amphimakhos and Thalpios, and of the remaining
twenty he puts ten under Diores, the son of Amarynkeus, and ten under
Polyxenos, the son of Agasthenes. Polyxenos came back safe from Troy and
begot a son, Amphimakhos. This name I think Polyxenos gave his son
because of his friendship with Amphimakhos, the son of Kteatos, who died
at Troy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.3.5">

Amphimakhos begot Eleios, and it was while Eleios was king in Elis that
the assembly of the Dorian army under the sons of Aristomakhos took
place, with a view to returning to the Peloponnesus. To their kings was
delivered this oracle, that they were to choose the “one with three
eyes” to lead them on their return. When they were at a loss as to the
meaning of the oracle, they were met by a man driving a mule, which was
blind of one eye.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.3.6">

Kresphontes inferred that this was the man indicated by the oracle, and
so the Dorians made him one of themselves. He urged them to descend upon
the Peloponnesus in ships, and not to attempt to go across the Isthmus
with a land army. Such was his advice, and at the same time, he led them
on the voyage from Naupaktos to Molykrion. In return, they agreed to
give him at his request the land of Elis. The man was Oxylos, son of
Haimon, the son of Thoas. This was the Thoas who helped the sons of
Atreus to destroy the empire of Priam, and from Thoas to Aitolos the son
of Endymion are six generations.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.3.7">

There were ties of kindred between the Herakleidai and the kings of
Aetolia; in particular the mothers of Thoas, the son of Andraemon, and
of Hyllos, the son of Hēraklēs, were sisters. It fell to the lot of
Oxylos to be an outlaw from Aetolia. The story goes that as he was
throwing the discus, he missed the mark and committed unintentional
homicide. The man killed by the discus, according to one account, was
Thermios, the brother of Oxylos; according to another, it was Alkidokos,
the son of Skopios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.1">

The following story is also told of Oxylos. He suspected that, when the
sons of Aristomakhos saw that the land of Elis was good and cultivated
throughout, they would be no longer willing to give it to him. He
accordingly led the Dorians through Arcadia and not through Elis. Oxylos
was anxious to get the kingdom of Elis without a battle, but Dios would
not give way; he proposed that, instead of their fighting a pitched
battle with all their forces, a single soldier should be chosen from
each army to fight as its champion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.2">

This proposal chanced to find favor with both sides, and the champions
chosen were the Eleian Degmenos, an archer, and Pyraikhmes, a slinger,
to represent the Aetolians. Pyraikhmes won, and Oxylos got the kingdom.
He allowed the old inhabitants, the Epeians, to keep their possessions,
except that he introduced among them Aetolian colonists, giving them a
share in the land. He assigned privileges to Dios and kept up after the
ancient manner the honors paid to heroes, especially the worship of
Augeias, to whom even at the present day hero-sacrifice is offered.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.3">

He is also said to have induced to come into the city the dwellers in
the villages near the wall, and by increasing the number of the
inhabitants to have made Elis larger and generally more prosperous.
There also came to him an oracle from Delphi that he should bring in as
cofounder “the descendant of Pelops.” Oxylos made diligent search, and
in his search, he discovered Agorios, son of Damasios, son of Penthilos,
son of Orestes. He brought Agorios himself from Helike in Achaea and
with him a small body of Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.4">

The wife of Oxylos, they say, was called Pieria, but beyond this nothing
more about her is recorded. Oxylos is said to have had two sons, Aitolos
and Laias. Aitolos died before his parents, who buried him in a tomb
which they caused to be made right in the gate leading to Olympia and
the sanctuary of Zeus. That they buried him thus was due to an oracle
forbidding the corpse to be laid either without the city or within it.
Right down to our own day, the gymnasiarch sacrifices to Aitolos as to a
hero every year.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.5">

After Oxylos, the kingdom devolved on Laias, son of Oxylos. His
descendants, however, I find did not reign, and so I pass them by,
though I know who they were; my narrative must not descend to men of
common rank. Later on Iphitos, of the line of Oxylos and contemporary
with Lycurgus \[Lykourgos\], who drew up the code of laws for the
Lacedaemonians, arranged the Games at Olympia and reestablished afresh
the Olympic festival and truce after an interruption of uncertain
length. The reason for this interruption I will set forth when my
narrative deals with Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.6">

At this time, Greece was grievously worn by internal strife and plague,
and it occurred to Iphitos to ask the god at Delphi for deliverance from
these evils. The story goes that the Pythian priestess ordained that
Iphitos himself and that the Eleians must renew the Olympic Games.
Iphitos also induced the Eleians to sacrifice to Hēraklēs as to a god,
whom hitherto they had looked upon as their enemy. The inscription at
Olympia calls Iphitos the son of Haimon, but most of the Greeks say that
his father was Praxonides and not Haimon, while the ancient records of
Elis traced him to a father of the same name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.7">

The Eleians played their part in the Trojan War and also in the battles
of the Persian invasion of Greece. I pass over their struggles with the
Pisans and Arcadians for the management of the Olympian Games. Against
their will, they joined the Lacedaemonians in their invasion of Athenian
territory, and shortly afterwards, they rose up with the Mantineians and
Argives against the Lacedaemonians, inducing Athens too to join the
alliance.[^322]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.8">

When Agis invaded the land and Xenias turned traitor, the Eleians won a
battle near Olympia, routed the Lacedaemonians, and drove them out of
the sacred enclosure; but shortly afterwards, the war was concluded by
the treaty I have already spoken of in my account of the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.4.9">

When Philip the son of Amyntas would not let Greece alone, the Eleians,
weakened by civil strife, joined the Macedonian alliance, but they could
not bring themselves to fight against the Greeks at Khaironeia. They
joined Philip’s attack on the Lacedaemonians[^323] because of their old
hatred of that people, but on the death of Alexander, they fought on the
side of the Greeks against Antipatros and the Macedonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.1">

Later on, Aristotīmos, the son of Damaretos, the son of Etymon, became
despot of Elis, being aided in his attempt by Antigonos, the son of
Demetrios, who was king in Macedonia. After a despotism of six months
Aristotīmos was deposed, a rising against him having been organized by
Khilon, Hellanikos, Lampis and Kylon; Kylon it was who with his own hand
killed the despot when he had sought sanctuary at the altar of Zeus the
Savior. Such were the wars of the Eleians, of which my present
enumeration must serve as a summary.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.2">

The land of Elis contains two marvels. Here, and here only in Greece,
does fine flax grow; and secondly, only over the border, and not within
it, can the mares be impregnated by asses. The cause of this is said to
have been a curse. The fine flax of Elis is as fine as that of the
Hebrews, but it is not so yellow.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.3">

As you go from Elis, there is a district stretching down to the sea. It
is called Samikon, and above it on the right is what is called
Triphylia, in which is the city Lepreus. The citizens of this city wish
to belong to the Arcadians, but it is plain that from the beginning,
they have been subject to the Eleians. Those that have won Olympic
victories have been announced by the herald as Eleians from Lepreus, and
Aristophanes in a comedy calls Lepreus a town of the Eleians. Leaving
the river Anigros, on the left there is a road leading to Lepreus; from
Samikon, another leads to it from Olympia and a third from Elis. The
longest of them is a day’s journey.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.4">

The city got its name, they say, from its founder Lepreus, the son of
Pyrgeus. There was also a story that Lepreus contended with Hēraklēs:
that he was as good a trencherman. Each killed an ox at the same time
and prepared it for the table. It turned out, even as Lepreus
maintained, that he was as powerful a trencherman as Hēraklēs.
Afterwards, he made bold to challenge him to a duel. Lepreus, they say,
lost, was killed and was buried in the land of Phigaleia. The
Phigalians, however, could not show a tomb of Lepreus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.5">

I have heard some who maintained that Lepreus was founded by Leprea, the
daughter of Pyrgeus. Others say that the first dwellers in the land were
afflicted with the disease leprosy and that the city received its name
from the misfortune of the inhabitants. The Lepreans told me that in
their city once was a temple of Zeus Leukaios (of the White Poplar), the
tomb of Lycurgus \[Lykourgos\], son of Aleus, and the tomb of Kaukon,
over which was the figure of a man holding a lyre.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.6">

But as far as I could see they had no tomb of distinction and no
sanctuary of any deity, save one of Demeter. Even this was built of
unburned brick and contained no image. Not far from the city of the
Lepreans is a spring called Arene, and they say that it derives its name
from the wife of Aphareus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.7">

Returning again to Samikon, and passing through the district, we reach
the mouth of the Anigros. The current of this river is often held back
by violent gales, which carry the sand from the open sea against it and
stop the onward flow of the water. So whenever the sand has become
soaked on both sides, by the sea without and by the river within, beasts
and still more travelers on foot are in danger of sinking into it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.8">

The Anigros descends from the mountain Lapithos in Arcadia, and right
from its source, its water does not smell sweet but actually stinks
horribly. Before it receives the tributary Akidas, it plainly cannot
support fish life at all. After the rivers unite, the fish that come
down into the Anigros with the water are uneatable, though before, if
they are caught in the Akidas, they are eatable.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.9">

I heard from an Ephesian that the Akidas was called Iardanos in ancient
times. I repeat his statement, though I have nowhere found evidence in
support of it. I am convinced that the peculiar odor of the Anigros is
due to the earth through which the water springs up, just as those
rivers beyond Ionia, the exhalation from which is deadly to man, owe
their peculiarity to the same cause. Some Greeks say that Kheiron,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.10">

others that Pylenor, another Centaur, when shot by Hēraklēs fled wounded
to this river and washed his injury in it and that it was the hydra’s
poison which gave the Anigros its nasty smell. Others again attribute
the quality of the river to Melampos, the son of Amythaon, who threw
into it the means he used to purify the daughters of Proitos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.5.11">

There is in Samikon a cave not far from the river and called the Cave of
the Nymphs of Anigros. Whoever enters it suffering from
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">alphos</span> or
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">leuke</span> first has to pray
to the nymphs and to promise some sacrifice or other, after which he
wipes the unhealthy parts of his body. Then, swimming through the river,
he leaves his old uncleanness in its water, coming up sound and of one
color.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.1">

Crossing the Anigros and going to Olympia by the straight road, not far
away on the right of the road, you reach a high district with a city
called Samia on it. This they say Polysperkhon the Aetolian used as a
fortified post against the Arcadians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.2">

As to the ruins of Arene, no Messenian and no Eleian could point them
out to me with certainty. Those who care to do so may make all sorts of
different guesses about it, but the most plausible account seemed to me
that of those who held that in the heroic age and even earlier, Samikon
was called Arene. These quoted too the words of the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

There is a river Minyeios flowing into the sea near Arene.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.3">

These ruins are very near to the Anigros; and although it might be
questioned whether Samikon was called Arene, yet the Arcadians are
agreed that of old the Anigros was called the Minyeios. One might well
hold that the Neda near the sea was made the boundary between Elis and
Messenia at the time of the return of the Herakleidai to the
Peloponnesus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.4">

After the Anigros, if you travel for a considerable distance through a
district that is generally sandy and grows wild pines, you will see
behind you on the left the ruins of Skillos. It was one of the cities of
Triphylia, but in the war between Pisa and Elis, the citizens of Skillos
openly helped Pisa against her enemy, and for this reason, the Eleians
utterly destroyed it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.5">

The Lacedaemonians afterwards separated Skillos from Elis and gave it to
Xenophon, the son of Grylos, when he had been exiled from Athens. The
reason for his banishment was that he had taken part in an expedition
which Cyrus, the greatest enemy of the Athenian people, had organized
against their friend, the king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] of the
Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\].[^324] Cyrus,
in fact, with his seat at Sardis, had been providing Lysander, the son
of Aristokritos, and the Lacedaemonians with money for their fleet.
Xenophon, accordingly, was banished, and having made Skillos his home,
he built in honor of Ephesian Artemis a temple with a sanctuary and a
sacred enclosure.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.6">

Skillos is also a hunting-ground for wild boars and deer, and the land
is crossed by a river called the Selinous. The guides of Elis said that
the Eleians recovered Skillos again, and that Xenophon was tried by the
Olympic Council for accepting the land from the Lacedaemonians and,
obtaining pardon from the Eleians, dwelled securely in Skillos.
Moreover, at a little distance from the sanctuary was shown a tomb, and
upon the tomb is a statue of marble from the Pentelic quarry. The
neighbors say that it is the tomb of Xenophon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.7">

As you go from Skillos along the road to Olympia, before you cross the
Alpheios, there is a mountain with high, precipitous cliffs. It is
called Mount Typaion. It is a law of Elis to cast down it any women who
are caught present at the Olympic Games or even on the other side of the
Alpheios on the days prohibited to women. However, they say that no
woman has been caught, except Kallipateira only; some, however, give the
lady the name of Pherenikē and not Kallipateira.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.6.8">

She, being a widow, disguised herself exactly like a gymnastic trainer,
and brought her son to compete at Olympia. Peisirodos, so her son was
called, was victorious, and Kallipateira, as she was jumping over the
enclosure in which they keep the trainers shut up, bared her person. So
her sex was discovered, but they let her go unpunished out of respect
for her father, her brothers, and her son, all of whom had been
victorious at Olympia. But a law was passed that in the future, trainers
should strip before entering the arena.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.1">

By the time you reach Olympia, the Alpheios is a large and very pleasant
river to see, being fed by several tributaries, including seven very
important ones. The Helisson joins the Alpheios passing through
Megalopolis; the Brentheates comes out of the territory of that city;
past Gortyna, where is a sanctuary of Asklepios, flows the Gortynios;
from Melainai, between the territories of Megalopolis and Heraia, comes
the Bouphagos; from the land of the Clitorians \[people of Kleitor\],
the Ladon; from Mount Erymanthos, a stream with the same name as the
mountain. These come down into the Alpheios from Arcadia; the Kladeos
comes from Elis to join it. The source of the Alpheios itself is in
Arcadia, and not in Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.2">

There is another thing told about the Alpheios. They say that there was
a hunter called Alpheios, who fell in love with Arethousa, who was
herself a huntress. Arethousa, unwilling to marry, crossed, they say, to
the island opposite Syracuse called Ortygia,and there turned from a
woman to a spring. Alpheios too was changed by his love into the river.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.3">

This account of Alpheios to Ortygia. But that the Alpheios passes
through the sea and mingles his waters with the spring at this place, I
cannot disbelieve as I know that the god at Delphi confirms the story.
For when he dispatched Arkhias the Corinthian to found Syracuse, he
uttered this oracle:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

An island, Ortygia, lies on the misty sea
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pontos</span>\]

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Over against Trinakria, where the mouth of Alpheios bubbles

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Mingling with the springs of broad Arethousa.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

For this reason, therefore, because the water of the Alpheios mingles
with the Arethousa, I am convinced that the story arose of the river’s
love-affair.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.4">

Those Greeks or Egyptians who have gone up into Ethiopia beyond Syene as
far as the Ethiopian city of Meroe all say that the Nile enters a lake,
and passes through it as though it were dry land, and that after this,
it flows through lower Ethiopia into Egypt before coming down into the
sea at Pharos. And in the land of the Hebrews, as I can myself bear
witness, the river Jordan passes through a lake called Tiberias, and
then, entering another lake called the Dead Sea, it disappears in it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.5">

The Dead Sea has the opposite qualities to those of any other water.
Living creatures float in it naturally without swimming; dying creatures
sink to the bottom. Hence, the lake is barren of fish; their danger
stares them in the face, and they flee back to the water which is their
native element. The peculiarity of the Alpheios is shared by a river of
Ionia. The source of it is on Mount Mykale, and having gone through the
intervening sea, the river rises again opposite Brankhidai at the harbor
called Panormos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.6">

These things then are as I have described them. As for the Olympic
Games, the most learned antiquaries of Elis say that Kronos was the
first king in the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] and that in
his honor, a temple was built in Olympia by the men of that age, who
were named the Golden Generation. When Zeus was born, Rhea entrusted the
guardianship of her son to the Dactyls of Ida, who are the same as those
called Kouretes. They came from Cretan Ida—Hēraklēs, Paionaios,
Epimedes, Iasios and Idas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.7">

Hēraklēs, being the eldest, matched his brothers, as a game, in a
running race, and garlanded the winner with a branch of wild olive, of
which they had such a copious supply that they slept on heaps of its
leaves while still green. It is said to have been introduced into Greece
by Hēraklēs from the land of the Hyperboreans, men living beyond the
home of the North Wind.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.8">

Olen the Lycian, in his hymn to Akhaïia, was the first to say that from
these Hyperboreans, Akhaïia came to Delos. When Melanopos of Cyme
composed an ode to Opis and Hekaerge declaring that these, even before
Akhaïia, came to Delos from the Hyperboreans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.9">

And Aristeas of Prokonnesos—for he too made mention of the
Hyperboreans—may perhaps have learned even more about them from the
Issedones, to whom he says in his poem that he came. Hēraklēs of Ida,
therefore, has the reputation of being the first to have held, on the
occasion I mentioned, the Games, and to have called them Olympic. So he
established the custom of holding them every fifth[^325] year, because
he and his brothers were five in number.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.7.10">

Now, some say that Zeus wrestled here with Kronos himself for the throne
while others say that he held the Games in honor of his victory over
Kronos. The record of victors includes Apollo, who outran Hermes and
beat Ares at boxing. It is for this reason, they say, that the Pythian
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> song is played
while the competitors in the pentathlon are jumping; for the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> song is sacred to
Apollo, and Apollo won Olympic victories.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.1">

Later on there came (they say) from Crete Klymenos, the son of Kardys,
about fifty years after the flood came upon the Greeks in the time of
Deukalion. He was descended from Hēraklēs of Ida; he held the Games at
Olympia and set up an altar in honor of Hēraklēs, his ancestor, and the
other Kouretes, giving to Hēraklēs the surname of Parastates \[‘the one
who stands by’\]. And Endymion, the son of Aethlios, deposed Klymenos
and set his sons a race in Olympia with the kingdom as the prize.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.2">

And about a generation later than Endymion, Pelops held the Games in
honor of Olympian Zeus in a more splendid manner than any of his
predecessors. When the sons of Pelops were scattered from Elis over all
the rest of Peloponnesus, Amythaon, the son of Kretheus and cousin of
Endymion on his father’s side (for they say that Aethlios too was the
son of Aeolus, though he was supposed to be a son of Zeus), held the
Olympian Games, and after him, Pelias and Neleus in common.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.3">

Augeias too held them, and likewise Hēraklēs, the son of Amphitryon,
after the conquest of Elis. The victors garlanded by Hēraklēs include
Iolaos, who won with the mares of Hēraklēs. So of old a competitor was
permitted to compete with mares which were not his own. Homer,[^326] at
any rate, in the Games held in honor of Patroklos, has told how Menelaos
drove a pair, of which one was Aithra, a mare of Agamemnon, while the
other was his own horse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.4">

Moreover, Iolaos used to be charioteer to Hēraklēs. So Iolaos won the
chariot-race, and Iasios, an Arcadian, the horse race; while one of the
sons of Tyndareus won the foot race and Polydeukes the boxing match. Of
Hēraklēs himself, it is said that he won victories at wrestling and the
pankration.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.5">

After the reign of Oxylos, who also celebrated the Games, the Olympic
festival was discontinued until the reign of Iphitos. When Iphitos, as I
have already related, renewed the Games, men had by this time forgotten
the ancient tradition, the memory of which revived bit by bit, and as it
revived, they made additions to the Games.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.6">

This I can prove; for when the unbroken tradition of the Olympiads began
there was first the foot-race, and Koroibos, an Eleian, was victor.
There is no statue of Koroibos at Olympia, but his tomb is on the
borders of Elis. Afterwards, at the fourteenth Festival,[^327] the
double foot-race was added: Hypenus of Pisa won the prize of wild olive
in the double race, and at the next Festival, Acanthus of Lacedaemon won
in the long course.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.7">

At the eighteenth Festival, they remembered the pentathlon and
wrestling. Lampis won the first and Eurybatos the second, these also
being Lacedaemonians. At the twenty-third Festival, they restored the
prizes for boxing, and the victor was Onomastos of Smyrna, which already
was a part of Ionia. At the twenty-fifth, they recognized the race of
full grown horses, and Pagondas of Thebes was proclaimed “victor in the
chariot race.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.8">

At the eighth Festival after this, they admitted the pankration for men
and the horse race. The horse race was won by Krauxidas of Crannon, and
Lygdamis of Syracuse overcame all who entered for the pankration.
Lygdamis has his tomb near the quarries at Syracuse, and according to
the Syracusans, he was as big as Hēraklēs of Thebes, though I cannot
vouch for the statement.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.9">

The contests for boys have no authority in old tradition but were
established by the Eleians themselves because they approved of them. The
prizes for running and wrestling open to boys were instituted at the
thirty-seventh Festival; Hipposthenes of Lacedaemon won the prize for
wrestling, and that for running was won by Polyneikes of Elis. At the
forty-first Festival they introduced boxing for boys, and the winner out
of those who entered was Philytas of Sybaris.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.10">

The race for men in armor was approved at the sixty-fifth Festival, to
provide, I suppose, military training; the first winner of the race with
shields was Damaretos of Heraia. The race for two full grown horses,
called <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">synoris</span> (chariot
and pair), was instituted at the ninety-third Festival, and the winner
was Euagoras of Elis. At the ninety-ninth Festival, they resolved to
hold contests for chariots drawn by foals, and Sybariades of Lacedaemon
won the garland with his chariot and foals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.8.11">

Afterwards, they added races for chariots and pairs of foals and for
single foals with rider. It is said that the victors proclaimed were:
for the chariot and pair, Belistikhe, a woman from the seaboard of
Macedonia; for the ridden race, Tlepolemos of Lycia. Tlepolemos, they
say, won at the hundred and thirty-first Festival, and Belistiche at the
third before this. At the hundred and forty-fifth Festival, prizes were
offered for boys in the pankration, the victory falling to Phaedimus, an
Aeolian from the city Troas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.9.1">

Certain contests, too, have been dropped at Olympia, the Eleians
resolving to discontinue them. The pentathlon for boys was instituted at
the thirty-eighth Festival; but after Eutelidas of Lacedaemon had
received the wild olive for it, the Eleians disapproved of boys entering
for this competition. The races for mule carts and the trotting race,
were instituted respectively at the seventieth Festival and the
seventy-first but were both abolished by proclamation at the
eighty-fourth. When they were first instituted, Thersios of Thessaly won
the race for mule carts, while Pataikos, an Achaean from Dyme, won the
trotting race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.9.2">

The trotting race was for mares, and in the last part of the course, the
riders jumped off and ran beside the mares, holding on to the bridle,
just as at the present day, those do who are called “mounters.” The
mounters, however, differ from the riders in the trotting race by having
different badges and by riding horses instead of mares. The cart race
was neither of venerable antiquity nor yet a graceful performance.
Moreover, each cart was drawn by a pair of mules, not horses, and there
is an ancient curse on the Eleians if this animal is even born in Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.9.3">

The order of the Games in our own day, which places the sacrifices to
the god for the pentathlon and chariot races second and those for the
other competitions first, was fixed at the seventy-seventh Festival.
Previously, the contests for men and for horses were held on the same
day. But at the Festival, I mentioned the contestants in the pankration
prolonged their contests till nightfall, because they were not summoned
to the arena soon enough. The cause of the delay was partly the chariot
race but still more the pentathlon. Kallias of Athens was champion of
the pankration on this occasion, but never afterwards was the pankration
to be interfered with by the pentathlon or the chariots.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.9.4">

The rules for the presidents of the Games are not the same now as they
were at the first institution of the festival. Iphitos acted as sole
president, as likewise did the descendants of Oxylos after Iphitos. But
at the fiftieth Festival, two men, appointed by lot from all the
Eleians, were entrusted with the management of the Olympic Games, and
for a long time after this, the number of the presidents continued to be
two.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.9.5">

But at the ninety-fifth Festival, nine umpires were appointed. To three
of them were entrusted the chariot races; another three were to
supervise the pentathlon; the rest superintended the remaining contests.
At the second Festival after this, the tenth umpire was added. At the
hundred and third Festival, the Eleians having twelve tribes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulai</span>\], one umpire
was chosen from each.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.9.6">

But they were hard pressed in a war with the Arcadians and lost a
portion of their territory, along with all the demes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmoi</span>\] included in the
surrendered district, and so the number of tribes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulai</span>\] was reduced to
eight in the hundred and fourth Olympiad. Thereupon were chosen umpires
equal in number to the tribes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulai</span>\]. At the
hundred and eighth Festival, they returned again to the number of ten
umpires, which has continued unchanged down to the present day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.1">

There are many things to be seen and to be heard in the Greek world \[=
among the Hellēnes\] that are worthy of wonder
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thauma</span>\]; but the
greatest share \[of all these wondrous things\]—from the standpoint of a
given god’s way-of-thinking
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phrontis</span>\]—goes to the
rituals \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drōmena</span>\] at
Eleusis and to the competition
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōn</span>\] at Olympia. The
sacred \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] grove
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">alsos</span>\] of Zeus has
been called, ever since ancient times, Altis, by way of deforming the
word \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">alsos</span>\]. Likewise
in a song \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">āisma</span>\] that
Pindar made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\]
composed for an Olympic victor, the place is called Altis \[Pindar
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Olympian</span> 10.45\]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.2">

The temple and the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] were made for
Zeus from spoils, when Pisa was crushed in war by the Eleians,[^328] and
along with Pisa, those of the subject population who were fellow
conspirators. The statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] itself was
made by Pheidias, as is testified by an inscription written under the
feet of Zeus: Pheidias, son of Kharmides, an Athenian, made me. The
temple is in the Doric style, and the outside has columns all around it.
It is built of native stone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.3">

Its height up to the pediment is sixty-eight feet, its width is
ninety-five, its length two hundred and thirty. The architect was Libon,
a native. The tiles are not of baked earth, but of Pentelic marble cut
into the shape of tiles. The invention is said to be that of Byzes of
Naxos, who they say made the images in Naxos, on which is the
inscription: To the offspring of Leto was I dedicated by Euergos, a
Naxian, son of Byzes, who first made tiles of stone. This Byzes lived
about the time of Alyattes the Lydian,[^329] when Astyages, the son of
Kyaxares, reigned over the Medes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.4">

At Olympia, a gilded caldron stands on each end of the roof, and a Nike,
also gilded, is set in about the middle of the pediment. Under the image
of Nike has been dedicated a golden shield with Medusa the Gorgon in
relief. The inscription on the shield declares who dedicated it and the
reason why they did so. It runs thus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The temple has a golden shield; from Tanagra

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The Lacedaemonians and their allies dedicated it,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

A gift taken from the Argives, Athenians, and Ionians,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The tithe offered for victory in war.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

This battle I also mentioned in my write-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-graphē</span>\] of Attica.
Then I described the tombs that are in Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.5">

On the outside of the frieze that runs round the temple at Olympia,
above the columns, are gilded shields twenty-one in number, an offering
made by the Roman general Mummius when he had conquered the Achaeans in
war, captured Corinth, and driven out its Dorian inhabitants.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.6">

As for the pediments: in the front \[= east\] pediment there is the
yet-to-happen chariot race between Pelops and Oinomaos, and preparation
for the running \[of the race\] is being made by both. A sculpture
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus has
been made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pe-poiēmenon</span>\] at the
middle of the pediment; on the right of Zeus is Oinomaos with a helmet
on his head, and, next to him, is Sterope his wife, who was one of the
daughters of Atlas. Myrtilos is there also, the charioteer of Oinomaos,
and he is sitting in front of the horses, which are four in number.
Behind him are two men. They have no names, but they too must be under
orders from Oinomaos to attend to the horses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.7">

At the very edge is situated Kladeos, the river which, in other ways
also, gets the most honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\]—after the
Alpheios—from the people of Elis. On the left of Zeus are Pelops, then
Hippodameia, then the charioteer
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēniokhos</span>\] of Pelops,
then the horses, and then two men, who are apparently grooms of Pelops.
Then the pediment narrows again, and in this part of it is made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pe-poiētai</span>\] the
Alpheios. The name of the man who was-the-chariot-driver
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēniokheîn</span>\] for Pelops
is, according to the narrative
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] of the people
of Troizen, Sphairos, but the guide
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ex-hēgētēs</span>\] at Olympia
was saying that he was Killas.

The sculptures in the front \[= east\] pediment are by Paionios, who
came from Mende in Thrace; those in the back \[= west\] pediment are by
Alkamenes, a contemporary of Pheidias, ranking next after him for skill
\[*sophiā*\] in the making \[*poiēsis*\] of statues \[*agalmata*\]. What
he \[= Alkamenes\] had on the pediment is the fight \[*makhē*\] between
the Lapithai and the Centaurs at the wedding of Peirithoös. In the
center of the pediment is Peirithoös. Next to him on one side is
Eurytion \[the Centaur\], who has seized \[*harpazein*\] the wife of
Peirithoös, and then there is Kaineus \[= one of the Lapithai\], who is
coming up to help Peirithoös, and, on the other side is Theseus
defending himself against the Centaurs with an axe \[*pelekus*\]. One
Centaur has just seized \[*harpazein*\] a girl \[*parthenos*\]; another,
a boy \[*pais*\] in-the-prime-of-youth \[*hōraios*\]. Alkamenes, I
think, made \[*poieîn*\] these things this way because he had learned
from the verses \[*epē*\] of Homer that Peirithoös was a son of Zeus,
and because he knew that Theseus was the fourth \[inclusive\] generation
removed from Pelops.

At Olympia, most of the deeds \[*erga*\] of Hēraklēs are \[represented\]
there. Above the doors of the Temple have-been-made \[passive of the
verb *poieîn*\] \[the following representations\]:

</div>

</div>

- the hunting-down of the Arcadian Boar,

- the matters with regard to Diomedes of Thrace

- also with regard to Gēryonēs in Erytheia,

- also, in connection with Atlas, what \[weight\] he \[= Atlas\] is
  carrying, \[the weight\] that he \[= Hēraklēs\] is about to
  receive-in-relay \[*ek-dekhesthai*\],

- and \[now\] he is purging the land, \[getting rid\] of the manure, for
  the sake of the people of Elis.

Then, \[looming\] above the doors of the rear-chamber \[of the Temple\],

- there he is, removing the band-that-girds-the-waist of the Amazon,

- and then there are the matters having to do with the Hind

- and \[having to do with\] the Bull at Knossos

- and \[having to do with\] the Birds at Stymphēlos,

- also having to do with the Hydra

- and, in the land of the people of Argos, with the Lion.

Most of the labors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erga</span>\] of Hēraklēs are
represented at Olympia. Above the doors of the temple is carved the
hunting of the Arcadian boar, his exploit against Diomedes the Thracian
and that against Geryones at Erytheia; he is also about to receive the
burden of Atlas, and he cleanses the land from dung for the people of
Elis. Above the doors of the rear chamber, he is taking the waistband
from the Amazon; and there are the stories of the deer, of the bull at
Knossos, of the Stymphalian birds, of the hydra, and of the Argive lion.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.10.10">

As you enter the bronze doors you see on the right, before the column,
Iphitos being garlanded by a woman, Ekhekheiria \[‘Truce’\], as the
elegiac couplet on the statue says. Within the temple stand columns, and
inside also are porticoes above, with an approach through them to the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]. There
has also been constructed a winding ascent to the roof.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.1">

The god sits on a throne, and he is made of gold and ivory. On his head
is placed a garland, which is an imitation of olive shoots. In his right
hand, he holds a Nike, which, like the statue, is of ivory and gold; she
wears a ribbon and—on her head—a garland. In the left hand of the god is
a scepter, ornamented with every kind of metal, and the bird sitting on
the scepter is the eagle. The sandals also of the god are of gold, as is
likewise his robe. Worked into the robe
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">himation</span>\] are figures
of animals and the flowers of the lily.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.2">

The throne is adorned with gold and with jewels, to say nothing of ebony
and ivory. Upon it are painted figures and worked images. There are four
Victories, represented as dancing women, one at each foot of the throne,
and two others at the base of each foot. On each of the two front feet
are set Theban children ravished by sphinxes, while under the sphinxes
Apollo and Artemis are shooting down the children of Niobe.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.3">

Between the feet of the throne are four rods, each one stretching from
foot to foot. The rod straight opposite the entrance has on it seven
images; how the eighth of them disappeared nobody knows. These must be
intended to be representations
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mīmēmata</span>\] of ancient
contests \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōnismata</span>\],
since in the time of Pheidias, contests for boys had not yet been
introduced. The figure of one binding his own head with a ribbon is said
to resemble in appearance Pantarkes, a boy of Elis said to have been the
love of Pheidias. Pantarkes too won the wrestling bout for boys at the
eighty-sixth Festival.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.4">

On the other rods is the band that with Hēraklēs fights against the
Amazons. The number of figures in the two parties is twenty-nine, and
Theseus too is ranged among the allies of Hēraklēs. The throne is
supported not only by the feet, but also by an equal number of columns
standing between the feet. It is impossible to go under the throne, in
the way we enter the inner part of the throne at Amyklai. At Olympia,
there are screens constructed like walls which keep people out.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.5">

Of these screens the part opposite the doors is only covered with dark
blue paint; the other parts show pictures by Panainos. Among them is
Atlas, supporting sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] and earth, by
whose side stands Hēraklēs ready to receive the load of Atlas, along
with Theseus; Peirithoös, Hellas, and Salamis carrying in her hand the
ornament made for the top of a ship’s bows; then Hēraklēs’ exploit
against the Nemean lion, the outrage committed by Ajax on Cassandra,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.6">

Hippodameia, the daughter of Oinomaos with her mother, and Prometheus
still held by his chains, though Hēraklēs has been raised up to him. For
among the stories told about Hēraklēs is one that he killed the eagle
which tormented Prometheus in the Caucasus, and set free Prometheus
himself from his chains. Last in the picture come Penthesileia giving up
her breath-of-life
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">psūkhē</span>\] and Achilles
supporting her; two Hesperides are carrying the apples, the keeping of
which, it is said, had been entrusted to them. This Panainos was a
brother of Pheidias; he also painted the picture of the battle of
Marathon in the painted portico in Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.7">

On the uppermost parts of the throne Pheidias has made, above the head
of the statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\],
three Graces on one side and three Seasons on the other. These in epic
poetry are included among the daughters of Zeus. Homer too in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>[^330] says that the
Seasons have been entrusted with the sky, just like guards of a king’s
court. The footstool of Zeus, called by the Athenians
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thranion</span>, has golden
lions and, in relief, the fight of Theseus against the Amazons, the
first brave deed of the Athenians against barbarians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">barbaroi</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.8">

On the pedestal supporting the throne and Zeus with all his adornments
are works in gold: the Sun mounted on a chariot, Zeus and Hērā,
Hephaistos, and by his side Grace. Close to her comes Hermes, and close
to Hermes, Hestia. After Hestia is Eros receiving Aphrodite as she rises
from the sea, and Aphrodite is being garlanded by Persuasion. There are
also reliefs of Apollo with Artemis, of Athena and of Hēraklēs; and near
the end of the pedestal, Amphitrite and Poseidon, while the Moon is
driving what I think is a horse. Some have said that the steed of the
goddess is a mule, not a horse, and they tell a naïve
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eu-ēthēs</span>\] story about
the mule.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.9">

I know that the height and width of the Olympian Zeus have been measured
and recorded; but I shall not make a citation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ep-ainos</span>\] of those who
made the measurements, for even their records fall far short of the
impression made by a sight of the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]. No, the god
himself according to what is said bore witness to the artistic skill of
Pheidias. For when the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] was quite
finished Pheidias prayed the god to show by a sign whether the work was
to his liking. Immediately, according to what is said, a thunderbolt
fell on that part of the floor where down to the present day the bronze
jar stood to cover the place.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.10">

All the floor in front of the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is paved, not
with white, but with black tiles. In a circle around the black stone
runs a raised rim of Parian marble, to keep in the olive oil that is
poured out. For olive oil is beneficial to the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] at Olympia,
and it is olive oil that keeps the ivory from being harmed by the
marshiness of the Altis. On the Athenian Acropolis, the ivory of the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] they
call the Maiden
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Parthénos</span>\] is
benefited not by olive oil but by water. For the Acropolis, owing to its
great height, is over-dry, so that the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], being made of
ivory, needs water or dampness.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.11.11">

When I asked at Epidaurus why they pour neither water nor olive oil on
\[the statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]
of\] Asklepios, the attendants at the sanctuary informed me that both
the statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
the god and the throne were built over a cistern.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.1">

Those who think that the projections from the mouth of an elephant are
not horns but teeth of the animal should consider both the elk, a beast
of the Celtic land, and also the Ethiopian bull. Male elks have horns on
their brows, but the female does not grow them at all. Ethiopian bulls
grow their horns on their noses. Who therefore would be greatly
surprised at horns growing out of an animal’s mouth?

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.2">

They may also correct their error from the following considerations.
Horns drop off animals each year and grow again; the deer and the
antelope undergo this experience, and so likewise does the elephant. But
a tooth will never be found to grow again, at least after the animal is
full-grown. So if the projections through the mouth were teeth and not
horns, how could they grow up again? Again, a tooth refuses to yield to
fire; but fire turns the horns of oxen and elephants from round to flat
and also into other shapes. However, the hippopotamus and the boar have
tusks growing out of the lower jaw, but we do not see horns growing out
of jaws.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.3">

So, be assured that an elephant’s horns descend through the temples from
above, and so bend outwards. My statement is not hearsay; I once saw an
elephant’s skull in the sanctuary of Artemis in Campania. The sanctuary
is about thirty stadium-lengths from Capua, which is the capital of
Campania. So the elephant differs from all other animals in the way its
horns grow, just as its size and shape are peculiar to itself. And the
Greeks in my opinion showed an unsurpassed zeal and generosity in
honoring the gods, in that they imported ivory from India and Ethiopia
to make images.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.4">

In Olympia, there is a woolen curtain, adorned with Assyrian weaving and
Phoenician purple, which was dedicated by Antiokhos, who also gave as
offerings the golden
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aegis</span> with the Gorgon on
it above the theater in Athens. This curtain is not drawn upwards to the
roof as is that in the temple of Artemis at Ephesos, but it is let down
to the ground by cords.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.5">

The offerings inside, or in the front part of the temple include: a
throne of Arimnestos, king of Etruria, who was the first barbarian to
present an offering to the Olympic Zeus, and bronze horses of Kyniska,
tokens of an Olympic victory. These are not as large as real horses and
stand in the front part of the temple on the right as you enter. There
is also a tripod, plated with bronze, upon which, before the table was
made, were displayed the garlands for the victors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.6">

There are statues of ‘Kings’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileis</span>\]: Hadrian, of
Parian marble dedicated by the cities of the Achaean confederacy, and
Trajan, dedicated by all the Greeks. This King
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] subdued the
Getai beyond Thrace, and made war on Osroes, the descendant of Arsaces
and on the Parthians. Of his architectural achievements, the most
remarkable are baths called after him, a large circular theater, a
building for horse races which is actually two stadium-lengths long, and
the Forum at Rome, worth seeing not only for its general beauty but
especially for its roof made of bronze.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.7">

Of the statues set up in the round buildings, the amber one represents
Augustus the Roman emperor, the ivory one they told me was a portrait of
Nikomedes, king of Bithynia. After him, the greatest city in Bithynia
was renamed Nikomedeia;[^331] before him, it was called Astakos, and its
first founder was Zypoetes, a Thracian by birth to judge from his name.
This amber of which the statue of Augustus is made, when found native in
the sand of the Eridanos, is very rare and precious to men for many
reasons; the other “amber” is an alloy of gold and silver.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.12.8">

In the temple at Olympia are four offerings of Nero—three garlands
representing wild olive leaves, and one representing oak leaves. Here
too are laid twenty-five bronze shields, which are for the armed men to
carry in the race. Tablets too are set up, including one on which is
written the oath sworn by the Eleians to the Athenians, the Argives, and
the Mantineians that they would be their allies for a hundred
years.[^332]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.1">

Within the Altis, there is also a sacred enclosure consecrated to
Pelops, whom the Eleians as much prefer in honor above the heroes of
Olympia as they prefer Zeus over the other gods. To the right of the
entrance of the temple of Zeus, on the north side, lies the Pelopion. It
is far enough removed from the temple for statues and other offerings to
stand in the intervening space, and beginning at about the middle of the
temple, it extends as far as the rear chamber. It is surrounded by a
stone fence, within which trees grow and statues have been dedicated.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.2">

The entrance is on the west. The sanctuary is said to have been set
apart to Pelops by Hēraklēs the son of Amphitryon. Hēraklēs too was a
great-grandson of Pelops, and he is also said to have sacrificed to him
into the pit \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bothros</span>\].
Right down to the present day, the magistrates of the year sacrifice to
him, and the victim is a black ram. No portion of this sacrifice goes to
the soothsayer, only the neck of the ram it is usual to give to the
‘woodman’ \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xuleús</span>\], as
he is called.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.3">

The woodman \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xuleús</span>\] is
one of the servants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikétai</span>\] of Zeus, and
the task assigned to him is to supply cities and private individuals
with wood for sacrifices at a fixed rate, wood of the white poplar, but
of no other tree, being allowed. If anybody, whether Eleian or stranger,
eats of the meat of the victim sacrificed to Pelops, he may not enter
the temple of Zeus. The same rule applies to those who sacrifice to
Telephos at Pergamon on the river Kaïkos; these too may not go up to the
temple of Asklepios before they have bathed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.4">

The following tale too is told. When the war of the Greeks against Troy
was prolonged, the soothsayers prophesied to them that they would not
take the city until they had fetched the bow and arrows of Hēraklēs and
a bone of Pelops. So it is said that they sent for Philoctetes to the
camp, and from Pisa was brought to them a bone of Pelops—a shoulder
blade. As they were returning home, the ship carrying the bone of Pelops
was wrecked off Euboea in the storm.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.5">

Many years later than the capture of Troy, Damarmenos, a fisherman from
Eretria, cast a net into the sea and drew up the bone. Marveling at its
size, he kept it hidden in the sand. At last, he went to Delphi to
inquire whose the bone was and what he ought to do with it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.6">

It happened that by the providence of the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] there was then
at Delphi an Eleian embassy praying for deliverance from a pestilence.
So the Pythian priestess ordered the Eleians to recover the bones of
Pelops, and Damarmenos to give back to the Eleians what he had found. He
did so, and the Eleians repaid him by appointing him and his descendants
to be guardians of the bone. The shoulder blade of Pelops had
disappeared by my time because, I suppose, it had been hidden in the
depths so long, and besides its age, it was greatly decayed through the
salt water.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.7">

There are signs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">semeîa</span>\], surviving
right down to the present time, that Pelops and Tantalos once had an
abode \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en-oikēsis</span>\]
in-my-own-homeland
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parà+hēmîn</span>\]. There is
a lake \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">limnē</span>\] named
after Tantalos, as also a most-visible
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouk aphanḗs</span>\] tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\], while, at
Sipylos, on a peak
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koruphē</span>\] of the
mountain, there is a throne
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thronos</span>\] of Pelops
beyond the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Plastēnē
the Mother. Crossing the river Hermos, one finds there, in Tēmnos, a
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Aphrodite that has-been-made
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pe-poiē-ménon</span>\] from a
\[living-and-\] flourishing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">te-thēluia</span>, perfect of

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] that it \[= the
statue carved from the wood of the living myrtle-tree\] had been
dedicated by Pelops when he was praying-in-advance-to the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theós</span> feminine\] and
asking for marriage
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gamos</span>\] with
Hippodameia to happen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.8">

The altar of Olympic Zeus is about equally distant from the Pelopion and
the sanctuary of Hērā, but it is in front of both. Some say that it was
built by Idaean Hēraklēs, others by the local heroes two generations
later than Hēraklēs. It has been made from the ash of the thighs of the
victims sacrificed to Zeus, as is also the altar at Pergamon. There is
an ashen altar of Samian Hērā not a bit grander than what in Attica the
Athenians call ‘improvised hearths’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eskharai</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.9">

The first stage of the altar at Olympia called prothysis has a
circumference of one hundred and twenty-five feet; the circumference of
the stage on the prothysis is thirty-two feet; the total height of the
altar reaches to twenty-two feet. The victims themselves it is the
custom to sacrifice on the lower stage, the prothysis. But the thighs
they carry up to the highest part of the altar and burn them there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.10">

The steps that lead up to the prothysis from either side are made of
stone, but those leading from the prothysis to the upper part of the
altar are, like the altar itself, composed of ashes. The ascent to the
prothysis may be made by girls, and likewise by women, when they are not
shut out from Olympia, but men only can ascend from the prothysis to the
highest part of the altar. Even when the festival is not being held,
sacrifice is offered to Zeus by private individuals and daily by the
Eleians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.13.11">

Every year, the soothsayers, keeping carefully to the nineteenth day of
the month Elaphios, bring the ash from the town hall, and making it into
a paste with the water of the Alpheios, they daub the altar with it. But
never may the ash be made into paste with other water, and for this
reason, the Alpheios is thought to be of all rivers the dearest to
Olympic Zeus. There is also an altar at Didyma of the Milesians, which
Hēraklēs the Theban is said by the Milesians to have made from the blood
of the victims. But in later times, the blood of the sacrifices has not
made the altar excessively large.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.1">

The altar at Olympia shows another strange peculiarity, which is this.
The kite, the bird of prey with the most rapacious nature, never harms
those who are sacrificing at Olympia. Should ever a kite seize the
entrails or some of the flesh, it is regarded as an unfavorable sign for
the sacrificer. There is a story that when Hēraklēs, the son of Alkmene,
was sacrificing at Olympia, he was much worried by the flies. So either
on his own initiative or at somebody’s suggestion, he sacrificed to Zeus
Averter of Flies, and thus, the flies were diverted to the other side of
the Alpheios. It is said that in the same way, the Eleians too sacrifice
to Zeus, Averter of Flies, to drive the flies out of Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.2">

The Eleians are accustomed to use for the sacrifices to Zeus the wood of
the white poplar and of no other tree, preferring the white poplar, I
think, simply and solely because Hēraklēs brought it into Greece from
Thesprotia. And it is my opinion that when Hēraklēs sacrificed to Zeus
at Olympia, he himself burned the thigh bones of the victims upon wood
of the white poplar. Hēraklēs found the white poplar growing on the
banks of the Acheron, the river in Thesprotia, and for this reason,
Homer[^333] calls it ‘Acherōïs’.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.3">

So, from the first down to the present, all rivers have not been equally
suited for the growth of plants and trees. Tamarisks grow best and in
the greatest numbers by the Maeander; the Boeotian Asopos can produce
the tallest reeds; the persea tree flourishes only in the water of the
Nile. So it is no wonder that the white poplar grew first by the Acheron
and the wild olive by the Alpheios and that the dark poplar is a
nursling of the Celtic land of the Celtic Eridanos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.4">

Now that I have finished my account of the greatest altar, let me
proceed to describe all the altars in Olympia. My narrative will follow
in dealing with them the order in which the Eleians are accustomed to
sacrifice on the altars. They sacrifice to Hestia first, secondly to
Olympic Zeus, going to the altar within the temple, thirdly to Zeus
Laoitas and to Poseidon Laoitas. This sacrifice too it is usual to offer
on one altar. Fourthly and fifthly, they sacrifice to Artemis and to
Athena, Goddess of Plunder,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.5">

sixthly to the Worker Goddess. The descendants of Pheidias, called
Cleansers, have received from the Eleians the privilege of cleaning the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus
from the dirt that settles on it, and they sacrifice to the Worker
Goddess before they begin to polish the. There is another altar of
Athena near the temple, and by it, a square altar of Artemis rising
gently to a height.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.6">

After the altars I have enumerated, there is one on which they sacrifice
to Alpheios and Artemis together. The cause of this Pindar, I think,
intimates in an ode, and I give it in my account of Letrini. Not far
from it stands another altar of Alpheios, and by it, one of Hephaistos.
This altar of Hephaistos some Eleians call the altar of Warlike Zeus.
These same Eleians also say that Oinomaos used to sacrifice to Warlike
Zeus on this altar whenever he was about to begin a chariot race with
one of the suitors of Hippodameia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.7">

After this stands an altar of Hēraklēs surnamed Parastates (Assistant);
there are also altars of the brothers of Hēraklēs—Epimedes, Idas,
Paionaios, and Iasos; I am aware, however, that the altar of Idas is
called by others the altar of Acesidas. At the place where are the
foundations of the house of Oinomaos stand two altars: one is of Zeus of
the Courtyard, which Oinomaos appears to have had built himself, and the
other of Zeus of the Thunderbolt, which I believe they built later, when
the thunderbolt had struck the house of Oinomaos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.8">

An account of the great altar I gave a little way back; it is called the
altar of Olympian Zeus. By it is an altar of Unknown Gods, and after
this, an altar of Zeus Purifier, one of Nike, and another of Zeus—this
time surnamed Underground. There are also altars of all gods, and of
Hērā surnamed Olympian, this too being made of ashes. They say that it
was dedicated by Klymenos. After this comes an altar of Apollo and
Hermes in common, because the Greeks have a story about them that Hermes
invented the lyre and Apollo the lute.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.9">

Next come an altar of Concord, another of Athena, and the altar of the
Mother of the gods. Quite close to the entrance to the stadium are two
altars; one they call the altar of Hermes of the Games, the other the
altar of Opportunity. I know that a hymn to Opportunity is one of the
poems of Ion of Chios; in the hymn, Opportunity is made out to be the
youngest child of Zeus. Near the treasury of the Sikyonians is an altar
of Hēraklēs, either one of the Kouretes or the son of Alkmene, for both
accounts are given.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.14.10">

On what is called the Gaion (sanctuary of Earth) is an altar of Earth;
it too is of ashes. In more ancient days, they say that there was an
oracle also of Earth in this place. On what is called the Stomion
(Mouth), the altar to Themis has been built. All around the altar of
Zeus, Descender runs a fence; this altar is near the great altar made of
the ashes. The reader must remember that the altars have not been
enumerated in the order in which they stand, but the order followed by
my narrative is that followed by the Eleians in their sacrifices. By the
sacred enclosure of Pelops is an altar of Dionysus and the Graces in
common; between them is an altar of the Muses, and next to these, an
altar of the Nymphs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.1">

Outside the Altis there is a building called the workshop of Pheidias,
where he made the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus piece
by piece. In the building is an altar to all the gods in common. Now
return back again to the Altis opposite the Leonidaion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.2">

The Leonidaion is outside the sacred enclosure but at the processional
entrance to the Altis, which is the only way open to those who take part
in the processions. It was dedicated by Leonidas, a native, but in my
time, the Roman governors of Greece used it as their lodging. Between
the processional entrance and the Leonidaion is a street, for the
Eleians call streets what the Athenians call lanes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.3">

Well, there is in the Altis, when you are about to pass to the left of
the Leonidaion, an altar of Aphrodite, and after it, one of the Seasons.
About opposite the rear chamber, a wild olive is growing on the right.
It is called the olive of the Beautiful Crown, and from its leaves are
made the garlands which it is customary to give to winners of Olympic
contests. Near this wild olive stands an altar of Nymphs; these too are
styled Nymphs of the Beautiful Crowns.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.4">

Outside the Altis, but on the right of the Leonidaion, is an altar of
Artemis of the Market, and one has also been built for Mistresses, and
in my account of Arcadia, I will tell you about the goddess they call
Mistress. After this is an altar of Zeus of the Market, and before what
is called the Front Seats stands an altar of Apollo surnamed Pythian,
and after it, one of Dionysus. The last altar is said to be not old and
to have been dedicated by private individuals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.5">

As you go to the starting point for the chariot race there is an altar
with an inscription “to the Bringer of Fate.” This is plainly a surname
of Zeus, who knows the affairs of men, all that the Fates give them, and
all that is not destined for them. Near there is also an oblong altar of
Fates, after it, one of Hermes, and the next two are of Zeus Most High.
At the starting point for the chariot race, just about opposite the
middle of it, there are in the open altars of Poseidon god of horses and
Hērā goddess of horses, and near the column, an altar of the Dioskouroi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.6">

At the entrance to what is called the Wedge, there is on one side an
altar of Ares god of horses, on the other one of Athena goddess of
horses. On entering the Wedge itself, you see altars of Good Luck, Pan,
and Aphrodite; at the innermost part of the Wedge, an altar of the
Nymphs called Blooming. An altar of Artemis stands on the right as you
return from the Portico that the Eleians call the Portico of Agnaptos,
giving to the building the name of its architect.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.7">

After re-entering the Altis by the processional gate, there are behind
the Hēraion altars of the river Kladeos and of Artemis; the one after
them is Apollo’s, the fourth is of Artemis surnamed Coccoca, and the
fifth is of Apollo Thermios. As to the Eleian surname Thermios, the
conjecture occurred to me that in the Attic dialect it would be
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thesmios</span> (god of laws),
but why Artemis is surnamed Coccoca, I could not discover.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.8">

Before what is called Theakleon is a building, in a corner of which has
been set up an altar of Pan. The Town Hall of the Eleians is within the
Altis, and it has been built beside the exit beyond the gymnasium. In
this gymnasium are the running tracks and the wrestling grounds for the
athletes. In front of the door of the Town Hall is an altar of Artemis
the Hunter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.9">

In the Town Hall itself, on the right as you enter the room where they
have the hearth, is an altar of Pan. This hearth too is made of ashes,
and on it, fire burns every day and likewise every night. The ashes from
this hearth, according to the account I have already given, they bring
to the altar of Olympian Zeus, and what is brought from the hearth
contributes a great deal to the size of the altar.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.10">

Each month the Eleians sacrifice once on all the altars I have
enumerated. They sacrifice in an ancient manner; for they burn on the
altars incense with wheat which has been kneaded with honey, placing
also on the altars twigs of olive, and using wine for a libation. Only
to the Nymphs and the Mistresses are they not accustomed to pour wine in
libation, nor do they pour it on the altar common to all the gods. The
care of the sacrifices is given to a priest, holding office for one
month, to soothsayers and libation bearers, and also to a guide, an
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> player, and the
woodman.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.11">

The traditional words spoken by them in the Town Hall at the libations,
and the hymns which they sing, it was not right for me to introduce into
my narrative. They pour libations, not only to the Greek gods, but also
to the god in Libya, to Hērā Ammonia and to Parammon, which is a surname
of Hermes. From very early times, it is plain that they used the oracle
in Libya, and in the temple of Ammon are altars which the Eleians
dedicated. On them are engraved the questions of the Eleians, the
replies of the god, and the names of the men who came to Ammon from
Elis. These are in the temple of Ammon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.15.12">

The Eleians also pour libations to all heroes and wives of heroes who
are honored either in Elis or among the Aetolians. The songs sung in the
Town Hall are in the Doric dialect, but they do not say who it was that
composed them. The Eleians also have a banqueting room. This too is in
the Town Hall, opposite the chamber where stands the hearth. In this
room, they entertain the winners in the Olympic Games.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.1">

It remains after this for me to describe the temple of Hērā and the
noteworthy objects contained in it. The Eleian account says that it was
the people of Skillos, one of the cities in Triphylia, who built the
temple about eight years after Oxylos came to the throne of Elis. The
style of the temple is Doric, and columns stand all round it. In the
rear chamber, one of the two columns is of oak. The length of the temple
is one hundred and sixty-nine feet, the width sixty-three feet, the
height not short of fifty feet. Who the architect was they do not
relate.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.2">

Every fourth year there is woven for Hērā a robe by the Sixteen women,
and the same also hold Games called Heraia. The Games consist of foot
races for girls. These are not all of the same age. The first to run are
the youngest; after them come the next in age, and the last to run are
the oldest of the girls. They run in the following way:

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.3">

Their hair hangs down, a tunic reaches to a little above the knee, and
they bare the right shoulder as far as the breast. These too have the
Olympic stadium reserved for their Games, but the course of the stadium
is shortened for them by about one-sixth of its length. To the winning
girls they give garlands of olive and a portion of the cow sacrificed to
Hērā. They may also dedicate statues with their names inscribed upon
them. Those who administer to the Sixteen are, like the presidents of
the Games, married women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.4">

The Games of the girls too are traced back to ancient times; they say
that, out of gratitude to Hērā for her marriage with Pelops, Hippodameia
assembled the Sixteen Women, and with them, inaugurated the Heraia. They
relate too that a victory was won by Chloris, the only surviving
daughter of the house of Amphion, though with her, they say, survived
one of her brothers. As to the children of Niobe, what I myself chanced
to learn about them, I have set forth in my account of Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.5">

Besides the account already given, they tell another story about the
Sixteen Women as follows. Damophon, it is said, when tyrant of Pisa did
much grievous harm to the Eleians. But when he died, since the people of
Pisa refused to participate as a people in their tyrant’s sins, and the
Eleians too became quite ready to lay aside their grievances, they chose
a woman from each of the sixteen cities of Elis still inhabited at that
time to settle their differences; this woman to be the oldest, the most
noble, and the most esteemed of all the women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.6">

The cities from which they chose the women were Elis.The women from
these cities made peace between Pisa and Elis. Later on, they were
entrusted with the management of the Games called Heraia, and with the
weaving of the robe for Hērā. The Sixteen Women also arrange two choral
dances, one called that of Physkoa and the other that of Hippodameia.
This Physkoa they say came from Elis in the Hollow, and the name of the
deme \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] where she
lived was Orthia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.7">

She mated, they say, with Dionysus and bore him a son called Narkaios.
When he grew up, he made war against the neighboring folk and rose to
great power, setting up moreover a sanctuary of Athena surnamed Narkaia.
They say too that Narkaios and Physkoa were the first to pay worship to
Dionysus. So various honors are paid to Physkoa, especially that of the
choral dance, named after her and managed by the Sixteen Women. The
Eleians still adhere to the other ancient customs, even though some of
the cities have been destroyed. For they are now divided into eight
tribes \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulai</span>\], and
they choose two women from each.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.16.8">

Whatever ritual it is the duty of either the Sixteen Women or the Eleian
umpires to perform, they do not perform before they have purified
themselves by sacrificing a pig that is ritually appropriate for
purification and with water. Their purification takes place at the
spring Piera. You reach this spring as you go along the flat road from
Olympia to Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.1">

These things, then, are as I have already described. In the temple of
Hērā is a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Zeus, and
the statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Hērā is sitting on a throne with Zeus standing by her, bearded and with
a helmet on his head. They are crude works of art. The figures of
Seasons next to them, seated upon thrones, were made by the Aeginetan
Smilis.[^334] Beside them stands a statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Themis, as
being mother of the Seasons. It is the work of Dorykleidas, a
Lacedaemonian by birth and a disciple of Dipoinos and Skyllis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.2">

The Hesperides, five in number, were made by Theokles, who like
Dorykleidas was a Lacedaemonian, the son of Hegylus; he too, they say,
was a student under Skyllis and Dipoinos. The Athena wearing a helmet
and carrying a spear and shield is, it is said, a work of Medon, a
Lacedaemonian, brother of Dorykleidas, and a pupil of the same masters.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.3">

Then the Maiden and Demeter sit opposite each other, while Apollo and
Artemis stand opposite each other. Here too have been dedicated Leto,
Fortune, Dionysus and a winged Nike. I cannot say who the artists were,
but these figures too are in my opinion very ancient. The figures I have
enumerated are of ivory and gold, but at a later date other statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] were
dedicated in the Hēraion, including a marble Hermes carrying the baby
Dionysus, a work of Praxiteles, and a bronze Aphrodite made by Kleon of
Sikyon.[^335]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.4">

The master of this Kleon, called Antiphanes, was a pupil of Periklytos,
who himself was a pupil of Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\] of Argos. A nude
gilded child is seated before Aphrodite, a work fashioned by Boethus of
Calchedon. There were also brought here from what is called the
Philippeion other statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of gold and
ivory, Eurydikē, the wife of Aridaios, and Olympias, the wife of Philip.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.5">

There is also a chest made of cedar with figures on it, some of ivory,
some of gold, others carved out of the cedar-wood itself. It was in this
chest that Kypselos, the tyrant of Corinth, was hidden by his mother
when the Bakkhidai were anxious to discover him after his birth. In
gratitude for the saving of Kypselos, his descendants, the Kypselidai as
they are called, dedicated the chest at Olympia. The Corinthians of that
age called chests
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kypselai</span>, and from this
word, they say, the child received his name of Kypselos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.6">

On most of the figures on the chest, there are inscriptions, written in
the ancient characters. In some cases the letters read straight on, but
in others, the form of the writing is what the Greeks call.[^336] It is
like this: at the end of the line the second line turns back, as runners
do when running the double race. Moreover, the inscriptions on the chest
are written in winding characters difficult to decipher. Beginning our
survey at the bottom, we see in the first space of the chest the
following scenes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.7">

Oinomaos is chasing Pelops, who is holding Hippodameia. Each of them has
two horses, but those of Pelops have wings. The next thing that is
worked in is the house of Amphiaraos, and baby Amphilokhos is being
carried by some old woman or other. In front of the house stands
Eriphyle with the necklace, and by her are her daughters, Eurydikē and
Demonassa, and the boy, Alkmaion, naked.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.8">

Asios in his poem makes out Alkmene also to be a daughter of Amphiaraos
and Eriphyle. Baton is driving the chariot of Amphiaraos, holding the
reins in one hand and a spear in the other. Amphiaraos already has one
foot on the chariot and his sword drawn; he is turned towards Eriphyle
in such a transport of anger that he can scarcely refrain from striking
her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.9">

After the house of Amphiaraos come the Games at the funeral of Pelias,
with the spectators looking at the competitors. Hēraklēs is seated on a
throne, and behind him is a woman. There is no inscription saying who
the woman is, but she is playing on a Phrygian, not a Greek,
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\].
Driving chariots drawn by pairs of horses are Pisos, son of Perieres,
and Asterion, son of Cometas (Asterion is said to have been one of the
Argonauts), Polydeukes, Admetos, and Euphemos. The poets declare that
the last was a son of Poseidon and a companion of Jason on his voyage to
Kolkhis. He it is who is winning the chariot race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.10">

Those who have boldly ventured to box are Admetos and Mopsos, the son of
Ampyx. Between them stands a man playing the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\],
as in our day they are accustomed to play the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\]
when the competitors in the pentathlon are jumping. The wrestling bout
between Jason and Peleus is an even one. Eurybotas is shown throwing the
discus; he must be some famous discus thrower. Those engaged in a
running race are Melanion, Neotheus, and Phalareus; the fourth runner is
Argeios, and the fifth is Iphiklos. Iphiklos is the winner, and Akastos
is holding out the garland to him. He is probably the father of the
Protesilaos, who joined in the war against Troy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.17.11">

Tripods too are set here, prizes, of course, for the winners; and there
are the daughters of Pelias, though the only one with her name inscribed
is Alcestis. Iolaos, who voluntarily helped Hēraklēs in his labors, is
shown as a victor in the chariot race. At this point, the funeral Games
of Pelias come to an end, and Hēraklēs, with Athena standing beside him,
is shooting at the hydra, the beast in the river Amymone. Hēraklēs can
be easily recognized by his exploit and his attitude, so his name is not
inscribed by him. There is also Phineus, the Thracian, and the sons of
Boreas are chasing the harpies away from him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.18.1">

Now I come to the second space on the chest, and in going round it, I
had better begin from the left. There is a figure of a woman holding on
her right arm a white child asleep, and on her left she has a black
child like one who is asleep. Each has his feet turned different ways.
The inscriptions declare, as one could infer without inscriptions, that
the figures are Death and Sleep, with Night the nurse of both.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.18.2">

A beautiful woman is punishing an ugly one, choking her with one hand
and with the other striking her with a staff. It is Justice who thus
treats Injustice. Two other women are pounding in mortars with pestles;
they are supposed to be wise in the lore of medicine, though there is no
inscription to them. Who the man is who is followed by a woman is made
plain by the hexameter verses, which run thus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

Idas brings back, not against her will, Fair-ankled Marpessa, daughter
of Euenos, whom Apollo carried off.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.18.3">

A man wearing a tunic is holding in his right hand a cup, and in his
left, a necklace; Alkmene is taking hold of them. This scene represents
the Greek story how Zeus in the likeness of Amphitryon had intercourse
with Alkmene. Menelaos, wearing a breastplate and carrying a sword, is
advancing to kill Helen, so it is plain that Troy has been captured.
Medea is seated upon a throne, while Jason stands on her right and
Aphrodite on her left. On them is an inscription: Jason weds Medea, as
Aphrodite bids.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.18.4">

There are also figures of Muses singing, with Apollo leading the song;
these too have an inscription: This is Leto’s son, Prince Apollo,
far-shooting; Around him are the Muses, a graceful choir, whom he is
leading. Atlas too is supporting, just as the story has it, sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] and earth
upon his shoulders; he is also carrying the apples of the Hesperides. A
man holding a sword is coming towards Atlas. This everybody can see is
Hēraklēs, though he is not mentioned specially in the inscription, which
reads:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Here is Atlas holding the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\], but he will
let go the apples.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.18.5">

There is also Ares clad in armor and leading Aphrodite. The inscription
by him is “Enyalios.” There is also a figure of Thetis as a maid; Peleus
is taking hold of her, and from the hand of Thetis, a snake is darting
at Peleus. The sisters of Medusa, with wings, are chasing Perseus, who
is flying. Only Perseus has his name inscribed on him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.18.6">

On the third space of the chest are military scenes. The greater number
of the figures is on foot, though there are some knights in two-horse
chariots. About the soldiers one may infer that they are advancing to
battle, but that they will recognize and greet each other. Two different
accounts of them are given by the guides. Some have said that they are
the Aetolians with Oxylos and the ancient Eleians and that they are
meeting in remembrance of their original descent and as a sign of their
mutual good will. Others declare that the soldiers are meeting in
battle, and that they are Pylians and Arcadians about to fight by the
city Pheia and the river Iardanos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.18.7">

But it cannot for a moment be admitted that the ancestor of Kypselos, a
Corinthian, having the chest made as a possession for himself, of his
own accord passed over all Corinthian story, and had carved on the chest
foreign events which were not famous. The following interpretation
suggested itself to me. Kypselos and his ancestors came originally from
Gonoussa above Sikyon, and one of their ancestors was Melas, the son of

But, as I have already related in my account of Corinth, Aletes refused
to admit as settlers Melas and the host with him, being nervous about an
oracle which had been given him from Delphi; but at last Melas, using
every art of winning favors, and returning with entreaties every time he
was driven away, persuaded Aletes however reluctantly to receive them.
One might infer that this army is represented by the figures that are
worked in upon the chest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.1">

In the fourth space on the chest as you go round from the left is
Boreas, who has carried off Oreithyia; instead of feet, he has serpents’
tails. Then comes the combat between Hēraklēs and Geryones, who is
represented as three men joined to one another. There is Theseus holding
a lyre, and by his side is Ariadne gripping a garland. Achilles and
Memnon are fighting; their mothers stand by their side.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.2">

There is also Melanion by whom is Atalanta holding a young deer. Ajax is
fighting a duel with Hector, according to the challenge,[^337] and
between the pair stands Strife in the form of a most repulsive woman.
Another figure of Strife is in the sanctuary of Ephesian Artemis;
Kalliphon of Samos included it in his picture of the battle at the ships
of the Greeks. On the chest are also the Dioskouroi, one of them a
beardless youth, and between them is Helen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.3">

Aithra, the daughter of Pittheus, lies thrown to the ground under the
feet at Helen. She is clothed in black, and the inscription upon the
group is an hexameter line with the addition of a single word:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The sons of Tyndareus are carrying of Helen, and are dragging Aithra

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

From Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.4">

Such is the way this line is constructed. Iphidamas, the son of Antenor,
is lying, and Koön is fighting for him against Agamemnon. On the shield
of Agamemnon is Fear, whose head is a lion’s. The inscription above the
corpse of Iphidamas runs: Iphidamas, and this is Koön fighting for him.
The inscription on the shield of Agamemnon runs:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.5">

This is the Fear of mortals: he who holds him is Agamemnon.

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

There is also Hermes bringing to Alexander the son of Priam the
goddesses of whose beauty he is to judge, the inscription on them being:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Here is Hermes, who is showing to Alexander, that he may arbitrate

On what account Artemis has wings on her shoulders I do not know; in her
right hand she grips a leopard, in her left a lion. Ajax too is
represented dragging Cassandra from the statue

by him is also an inscription: Ajax of Lokris is dragging Cassandra from
Athena.

Polyneikes, the son of Oedipus, has fallen on his knee, and Eteokles,
the other son of Oedipus, is rushing on him. Behind Polyneikes stands a
woman with teeth as cruel as those of a beast, and her fingernails are
bent like talons. An inscription by her calls her Doom, implying that
Polyneikes has been carried off by fate, and that Eteokles fully
deserved his end. Dionysus is lying down in a cave, a bearded figure
holding a golden cup, and clad in a tunic reaching to the feet. Around
him are vines, apple trees and pomegranate trees.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.7">

The highest space—the spaces are five in number—shows no inscription, so
that we can only conjecture what the reliefs mean. Well, there is a
grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. I was of
opinion that they were Odysseus and Circe, basing my view upon the
number of the handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are
doing. For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which
Homer mentions in his poetry.[^338] There is a Centaur with only two of
his legs those of a horse; his forelegs are human.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.8">

Next come two-horse chariots with women standing in them. The horses
have golden wings, and a man is giving armor to one of the women. I
conjecture that this scene refers to the death of Patroklos; the women
in the chariots, I take it, are Nereids, and Thetis is receiving the
armor from Hephaistos. And moreover, he who is giving the armor is not
strong upon his feet, and a slave follows him behind, holding a pair of
fire-tongs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.9">

An account also is given of the Centaur, that he is Kheiron, freed by
this time from human affairs and held worthy to share the home of the
gods, who has come to assuage the grief of Achilles. Two maidens in a
mule-cart, one holding the reins and the other wearing a veil upon her
head, are thought to be Nausikaa, the daughter of Alkinoos, and her
handmaiden, driving to the washing-pits. The man shooting at Centaurs,
some of which he has killed, is plainly Hēraklēs, and the exploit is one
of his.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.19.10">

As to the maker of the chest, I found it impossible to form any
conjecture. But the inscriptions upon it, though possibly composed by
some other poet, are, as I was on the whole inclined to hold, the work
of Eumēlos of Corinth. My main reason for this view is the processional
hymn he wrote for Delos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.1">

There are here other offerings also: a couch of no great size and for
the most part adorned with ivory; the discus of Iphitos; a table on
which are set out the garlands for the victors. The couch is said to
have been a toy of Hippodameia. The discus of Iphitos has inscribed upon
it the truce which the Eleians proclaim at the Olympic festivals; the
inscription is not written in a straight line, but the letters run in a
circle round the discus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.2">

The table is made of ivory and gold, and is the work of Kolotes. Kolotes
is said to have been a native of Herakleia, but specialists in the
history of sculpture maintain that he was a Parian, a pupil of
Pasiteles, who himself was a pupil of There are figures of Hērā, Zeus,
the Mother of the gods, Hermes, and Apollo with Artemis. Behind is the
disposition of the Games.

On one side are Asklepios and Hygieia, one of his daughters; Ares too
and Contest by his side; on the other are Pluto \[Ploutōn\], Dionysus,
Persephone and nymphs, one of them carrying a ball. As to the key (Pluto
\[Ploutōn\] holds a key) they say that what is called Hades has been
locked up by Pluto \[Ploutōn\], and that nobody will return back again
therefrom.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.4">

I must not omit the story told by Aristarkhos, the guide to the sights
at Olympia. He said that in his day the roof of the Hēraion had fallen
into decay. When the Eleians were repairing it, the corpse of a foot
soldier with wounds was discovered between the roof supporting the tiles
and the ornamented ceiling. This soldier took part in the battle in the
Altis between the Eleians and the Lacedaemonians.[^339]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.5">

The Eleians in fact climbed to defend themselves on to all high places
alike, including the sanctuaries of the gods. At any rate, this soldier
seemed to us to have crept under here after growing faint with his
wounds, and so died. Lying in a completely sheltered spot, the corpse
would suffer harm neither from the heat of summer nor from the frost of
winter. Aristarkhos said further that they carried the corpse outside
the Altis and buried him in the earth along with his armor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.6">

What the Eleians call the column of Oinomaos is in the direction of the
sanctuary of Zeus as you go from the great altar. On the left are four
columns with a roof on them, the whole constructed to protect a wooden
column which has decayed through age, being for the most part held
together by bands. This column, so runs the tale, stood in the house of
Oinomaos. Struck by lightning the rest of the house was destroyed by the
fire; of all the building only this column was left.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.7">

A bronze tablet in front of it has the following elegiac inscription:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Stranger, I am a remnant of a famous house,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

I, who once was a column in the house of Oinomaos;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Now by Kronos’ son I lie with these bands upon me,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

A precious thing, and the baleful flame of fire consumed me not.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

In my time another incident took place, which I will relate.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.8">

A Roman senator won an Olympic victory. Wishing to leave behind, as a
memorial of his victory, a bronze statue with an inscription, he
proceeded to dig, so as to make a foundation. When his excavation came
very close to the column of Oinomaos, the diggers found there fragments
of armor, bridles and curbs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.9">

These I saw myself as they were being dug out. A temple of no great size
in the Doric style they have called down to the present day
Mētrōon,[^340] keeping its ancient name. No image lies in it of the
Mother of the gods, but there stand in it statues of Roman emperors. The
Mētrōon is within the Altis, and so is a round building called the
Philippeion. On the roof of the Philippeion is a bronze poppy which
binds the beams together.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.20.10">

This building is on the left of the exit over against the Town Hall. It
is made of burned brick and is surrounded by columns. It was built by
Philip after the fall of Greece at Khairōneia. Here are set statues of
Philip and Alexander, and with them is Amyntas, Philip’s father. These
works too are by Leokhares and are of ivory and gold, as are the statues
of Olympias and Eurydikē.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.1">

From this point my account will proceed to a description of the statues
and votive offerings; but I think that it would be wrong to mix up the
accounts of them. For whereas on the Athenian Acropolis statues are
votive offerings like everything else, in the Altis some things only are
dedicated in honor of the gods, and statues are merely part of the
prizes awarded to the victors. The statues I will mention later; I will
turn first to the votive offerings, and go over the most noteworthy of
them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.2">

As you go to the stadium along the road from the Mētrōon, there is on
the left at the base of the mountain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oros</span>\] named Kronion a
platform of stone, right by the very mountain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oros</span>\], with steps
through it. By the platform have been set up bronze statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] of Zeus.
These have been made from the fines inflicted on athletes who have
wantonly broken the rules of the contests, and they are called Zanes
\[figures of Zeus\] by the natives.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.3">

The first, six in number, were set up in the ninety-eighth Olympiad. For
Eupolos of Thessaly bribed the boxers who entered the competition,
Agenor the Arcadian and Prytanis of Kyzikos, and with them also Phormion
of Halicarnassus, who had won at the preceding Festival. This is said to
have been the first time that an athlete violated the rules of the
Games, and the first to be fined by the Eleians were Eupolos and those
who accepted bribes from Eupolos. Two of these images are the work of
Kleon of Sikyon; who made the next four, I do not know.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.4">

Except for the third and the fourth, these images have elegiac
inscriptions on them. The first of the inscriptions is intended to make
plain that an Olympic victory is to be won, not by money, but by
swiftness of foot and strength of body. The inscription on the second
image declares that the image stands to the glory of the deity, through
the piety of the Eleians, and to be a terror to law-breaking athletes.
The purport of the inscription on the fifth image is praise of the
Eleians, especially for their fining the boxers; that of the sixth and
last is that the images are a warning to all the Greeks not to give
bribes to obtain an Olympic victory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.5">

Next after Eupolos they say that Kallippos of Athens, who had entered
for the pentathlon, bought off his fellow-competitors by bribes, and
that this offence occurred at tie hundred and twelfth Festival. When the
fine had been imposed by the Eleians on Kallippos and his antagonists,
the Athenians commissioned Hypereides to persuade the Eleians to remit
them the fine. The Eleians refused this favor, and the Athenians were
disdainful enough not to pay the money and to boycott the Olympic Games,
until finally the god at Delphi declared that he would deliver no oracle
on any matter to the Athenians before they had paid the Eleians the
fine.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.6">

So when it was paid, images, also six in number, were made in honor of
Zeus; on them are inscribed elegiac verses not a bit more elegant than
those relating the fine of Eupolos. The gist of the first inscription is
that the images were dedicated because the god by an oracle expressed
his approval of the Eleian decision against the pentathletes; on the
second image and likewise on the third are praises of the Eleians for
their fining the competitors in the pentathlon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.7">

The fourth purports to say that the contest at Olympia is one of merit
and not of wealth; the inscription on the fifth declares the reason for
dedicating the images, while that on the sixth commemorates the oracle
given to the Athenians by Delphi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.8">

The images next to those I have enumerated are two in number, and they
were dedicated from a fine imposed on wrestlers. As to their names,
neither I nor the guides of the Eleians knew them. On these images too
are inscriptions; one says that the Rhodians paid money to Olympian Zeus
for the wrongdoing of a wrestler; the other that certain men wrestled
for bribes and that the image was made from the fines imposed upon them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.9">

The rest of the information about these athletes comes from the guides
of the Eleians, who say that it was at the hundred and seventy-eighth
Festival that Eudelos accepted a bribe from Philostratus, and that this
Philostratus was a Rhodian. This account I found was at variance with
the Eleian record of Olympic victories. In this record, it is stated
that Straton of Alexandria at the hundred and seventy-eighth Festival
won on the same day the victory in the pankration and the victory at
wrestling. Alexandria on the Canopic mouth of the Nile was founded by
Alexander the son of Philip, but it is said that previously there was on
the site a small Egyptian town called Rakotis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.10">

Three competitors before the time of this Straton, and three others
after him, are known to have received the wild-olive for winning the
pankration and the wrestling: Kapros from Elis itself, and of the Greeks
on the other side of the Aegean, Aristomenes of Rhodes and Protophanes
of Magnesia on the Lethaios, were earlier than Straton; after him came
Marion his compatriot, Aristeas of Stratonikia (anciently both land and
city were called Khrysaoris), and the seventh was Nikostratos, from
Cilicia on the coast, though he was in no way a Cilician except in name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.11">

This Nikostratos while still a baby was stolen from Prymnessus in
Phrygia by robbers, being a child of a noble family. Conveyed to Aigeai,
he was bought by somebody or other, who some time afterwards dreamed a
dream. He thought that a lion’s whelp lay beneath the pallet-bed on
which Nikostratos was sleeping. Now Nikostratos, when he grew up, won
other victories elsewhere, besides in the pankration and wrestling at
Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.12">

Afterwards, others were fined by the Eleians, among whom was an
Alexandrian boxer at the two hundred and eighteenth Festival. The name
of the man fined was Apollonios, with the surname of Rhantes—it is a
sort of national characteristic for Alexandrians to have a surname. This
man was the first Egyptian to be convicted by the Eleians of a
misdemeanor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.13">

It was not for giving or taking a bribe that he was condemned, but for
the following outrageous conduct in connection with the Games. He did
not arrive by the prescribed time, and the Eleians, if they followed
their rule, had no option but to exclude him from the Games. For his
excuse, that he had been kept back among the Cyclades islands by
contrary winds, was proved to be an untruth by Hērakleidēs, himself an
Alexandrian by birth. He showed that Apollonios was late because he had
been picking up some money at the Ionian Games.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.14">

In these circumstances, the Eleians shut out from the Games Apollonios
with any other boxer who came after the prescribed time, and let the
garland go to Hērakleidēs without a contest. Whereupon Apollonios put on
his gloves for a fight, rushed at Hērakleidēs, and began to pummel him,
though he had already put the wild-olive on his head and had taken
refuge with the umpires. For this light-headed folly he was to pay
dearly.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.15">

There are also two other images of modern workmanship. For at the two
hundred and twenty-sixth Festival, they detected that two boxing men, in
a fight for victory only, had agreed about the issue for a sum of money.
For this misconduct a fine was inflicted, and of the images of Zeus that
were made, one stands on the left of the entrance to the stadium and the
other on the right. Of the boxers, the one bribed was called Didas, and
the briber was Sarapammon. They were from the same district, the newest
in Egypt, called Arsinoites.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.16">

It is a wonder in any case if a man has so little respect for the god of
Olympia as to take or give a bribe in the contests; it is an even
greater wonder that one of the Eleians themselves has fallen so low. But
it is said that the Eleian Damonikos did so fall at the hundred and
ninety second Festival. They say that collusion occurred between
Polyktor the son of Damonikos and Sosandros of Smyrna, of the same name
as his father; these were competitors for the wrestling prize of
wild-olive. Damonikos, it is alleged, being exceedingly ambitious that
his son should win, bribed the father of Sosandros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.17">

When the transaction became known, the umpires imposed a fine, but
instead of imposing it on the sons, they directed their anger against
the fathers, for that they were the real sinners. From this fine, images
were made. One is set up in the Eleian gymnasium; the other is in the
Altis in front of what is called the Painted Portico, because anciently
there were pictures on the walls. Some call this Portico “the Echo
Portico,” because when a man has shouted, his voice is repeated by the
echo seven or even more times.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.21.18">

They say that a competitor in the pankration, a man from Alexandria by
the name of Sarapion, at the two hundred and first Festival, was so
afraid of his antagonists that on the day before the pankration was to
be called on he ran away. This is the only occasion on record when any
man, not to say a man of Egypt, was fined for cowardice.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.22.1">

These were the causes for which I found that these images were made.
There are also images of Zeus dedicated by States and by individuals.
There is in the Altis an altar near the entrance leading to the stadium.
On it the Eleians do not sacrifice to any of the gods, but it is
customary for the trumpeters and heralds to stand upon it when they
compete. By the side of this altar has been built a pedestal of bronze,
and on it is an image of Zeus, about six cubits in height, with a
thunderbolt in either hand. It was dedicated by the people of Kynaitha.
The figure of Zeus as a boy wearing the necklace is the votive offering
of Kleolas, a Phliasian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.22.2">

By the side of what is called the Hippodamion is a semicircular stone
pedestal, and on it are Zeus, Thetis, and Day entreating Zeus on behalf
of her children. These are on the middle of the pedestal. There are
Achilles and Memnon, one at either edge of the pedestal, representing a
pair of combatants in position. There are other pairs similarly opposed,
barbarian against Greek: Odysseus opposed to Helenos, reputed to be the
cleverest men in the respective armies; Alexander and Menelaos, in
virtue of their ancient feud; Aeneas and Diomedes, and Deiphobos and
Ajax son of Telamon.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.22.3">

These are the work of Lykios, the son of Myron, and were dedicated by
the people of Apollonia on the Ionian sea. There are also elegiac verses
written in ancient characters under the feet of Zeus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

As memorials of Apollonia have we been dedicated—the place on the Ionian
sea that Phoebus founded, he of the uncut locks. The Apollonians, after

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Those who took the territory of the Abantes established these memorials
here with the help of the gods

The land called Abantis and the town of Thronion in it were a part of
the Thesprotian mainland over against the Ceraunian mountains.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.22.4">

When the Greek fleet was scattered on the voyage home from Troy, men of
Lokris who originated from Thronion, a city on the river Boagrios, and
Abantes from Euboea, with eight ships altogether, were driven on the
Ceraunian mountains. Settling here and founding the city of Thronion by
common agreement, they gave the name of Abantis to the land as far as
they occupied it. Afterwards, however, they were conquered in war and
expelled by the people of Apollonia, their neighbors. Apollonia was a
colony of Corcyra, they say, and Corcyra of Corinth, and the Corinthians
had their share of the spoils.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.22.5">

A little farther on is a Zeus turned towards the rising sun; he holds an
eagle in one hand and in the other a thunderbolt. On him are set spring
flowers, with a garland of them on his head. It is an offering of the
people of Metaponton. The artist was Aristonous of Aegina, but we do not
know when he lived nor who his teacher was.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.22.6">

The Phliasians also dedicated a Zeus, the daughters of Asopos, and
Asopos himself. Their images have been ordered thus: Nemeā is the first
of the sisters, and after her comes Zeus seizing Aegina; by Aegina
stands Harpina, who, according to the tradition of the Eleians and
Phliasians, mated with Ares and was the mother of Oinomaos, king around
Pisa; after her is Corcyra, with Thebe next; last of all comes Aesopus.
It is said about Corcyra that she mated with Poseidon, and the same
thing is said by Pindar of Thebe and Zeus.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.22.7">

Men of Leontinoi have set up a Zeus, not at public expense but out of
their private purse. The height of the image is seven cubits, and in its
hands are an eagle and the bolt of Zeus, in accordance with the poets’
tales. It was dedicated by Hippagoras, Phrynon, and Ainesidemos, who in
my opinion was some other Ainesidemos and not the tyrant of Leontinoi.

As you pass by the entrance to the Council Chamber, you see an image of
Zeus standing with no inscription on it, and then on turning to the
north, another image of Zeus. This is turned towards the rising sun, and
was dedicated by those Greeks who at Plataea fought against the Persians
under Mardonios.[^341] On the right of the pedestal are inscribed the
cities which took part in the engagement: first the Lacedaemonians,

Epidaurians, of the Arcadians the people of Tegea and Orkhomenos, after
them the dwellers in Phleious, Troizen and Hermion, the Tirynthians from
the Argolid, the Plataeans alone of the Boeotians, the Argives of
Mycenae, the islanders of Ceos and Mēlos, Ambraciots of the Thesprotian
mainland, the Tenians and the Lepreans, who were the only people from
Triphylia, but from the Aegean and the Cyclades there came not only the
Tenians but also the Naxians and Cythnians, Styrians too from Euboea,
after them Eleians, Potidaeans, Anaktorioi, and lastly the people of
Khalkis-on-the-Euripos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.23.3">

Of these cities the following are at the present day uninhabited:
Mycenae and Tiryns were destroyed by the Argives after the Persian wars.
The Ambraciots and Anaktorioi, colonists of Corinth, were taken away by
the Roman emperor[^342] to help to found Nikopolis near Actium. The
Potidaeans twice suffered removal from their city, once at the hands of
Philip, the son of Amyntas[^343], and once before this at the hands of
the Athenians.[^344]Afterwards, however, Kassandros restored the
Potidaeans to their homes, but the name of the city was changed from
Potidaea to Kassandreia after the name of its founder.[^345] The image
at Olympia dedicated by the Greeks was made by Anaxagoras of Aegina. The
name of this artist is omitted by the historians of Plataea.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.23.4">

In front of this Zeus, there is a bronze slab, on which are the terms of
the Thirty-years Peace between the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians. The
Athenians made this peace after they had reduced Euboea for the second
time, in the third year of the eighty-third Olympiad, when Crison of
Himera won the foot-race[^346]. One of the articles of the treaty is to
the effect that although Argos has no part in the treaty between Athens
and Sparta, yet the Athenians and the Argives may privately, if they
wish, be at peace with each other. Such are the terms of this treaty.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.23.5">

There is yet another image of Zeus dedicated beside the chariot of
Kleosthenes. This chariot I will describe later; the image of Zeus was
dedicated by the Megarians, and made by the brothers Psylakos and
Onaithos with the help of their sons. About their date, their nation and
their master, I can tell you nothing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.23.6">

By the chariot of Gelon stands an ancient Zeus holding a scepter which
is said to be an offering of the Hyblaeans. There were two cities in
Sicily called Hybla, one surnamed Gereatis and the other Greater, it
being in fact the greater of the two. They still retain their old names,
and are in the district of Catana. Greater Hybla is entirely
uninhabited, but Gereatis is a village of Catana, with a sanctuary of
the goddess Hyblaea which is held in honor by the Sicilians. The people
of Gereatis, I think, brought the image to Olympia. For Philistos, the
son of Arkhomenides, says that they were interpreters of portents and
dreams, and more given to devotions than any other barbarians in Sicily.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.23.7">

Near the offering of the Hyblaeans has been made a pedestal of bronze
with a Zeus upon it, which I conjecture to be about eighteen feet high.
The donors and sculptors are set forth in elegiac verse: The Clitorians
\[people of Kleitor\] dedicated this image to the god, a tithe from many
cities that they had reduced by force. The sculptors were Ariston and
Telestas, Own brothers and Laconians. I do not think that these
Laconians were famous all over Greece, for had they been so the Eleians
would have had something to say about them, and the Lacedaemonians more
still, seeing that they were their fellow citizens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.1">

By the side of the altar of Zeus Laoitas and Poseidon Laoitas is a Zeus
on a bronze pedestal. The people of Corinth gave it and Musus made it,
whoever this Musus may have been. As you go from the Council Chamber to
the great temple, there stands on the left an image of Zeus, garlanded
as it were with flowers, and with a thunderbolt set in his right hand.
It is the work of Ascarus of Thebes, a pupil of Kanakhos of Sikyon. The
inscription on it says that it is a tithe from the war between Phokis
and Thessaly.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.2">

If the Thessalians went to war with Phokis and dedicated the offering
from plunder taken from Phokis, this could not have been the so-called
“Sacred War,”[^347] but must have been a war between the two States
previous to the invasion of Greece by the Persians under their king. Not
far from this is a Zeus, which, as is declared by the verse inscribed on
it, was dedicated by the Psophidians for a success in war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.3">

On the right of the great temple is a Zeus facing the rising of the sun,
twelve feet high and dedicated, they say, by the Lacedaemonians, when
they entered on a war with the Messenians after their second revolt. On
it is an elegiac couplet: Accept, king, son of Kronos, Olympian Zeus, a
lovely image, And have a heart propitious to the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.4">

We know of no Roman, either commoner or senator, who gave a votive
offering to a Greek sanctuary before Mummius, and he dedicated at
Olympia a bronze Zeus from the spoils of Achaea[^348]. It stands on the
left of the offering of the Lacedaemonians by the side of the first
column on this side of the temple. The largest of the bronze images of
Zeus in the Altis is twenty-seven feet high, and was dedicated by the
Eleians themselves from the plunder of the war with the Arcadians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.5">

Beside the Pelopion is a column of no great height with a small image of
Zeus on it; one hand is outstretched. Opposite this are other offerings
in a row, and likewise images of Zeus and Ganymedes. Homer’s poem[^349]
tells how Ganymedes was carried off by the gods to be wine-bearer to
Zeus, and how horses were given to Tros in exchange for him. This
offering was dedicated by the Thessalian Gnathis and made by Aristokles,
pupil and son of Kleoitas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.6">

There is also another Zeus represented as a beardless youth, which is
among offerings of Mikythos. The history of Mikythos, his family, and
why he dedicated so many offerings at Olympia, my narrative will
presently set forth. A little farther on in a straight line from the
image I have mentioned is another beardless image of Zeus. It was
dedicated by the people of Elaea, who live in the first city of Aeolis
you reach on descending from the plain of the Kaïkos to the sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.7">

Yet another image of Zeus comes next, and the inscription on it says
that it was dedicated by the Chersonesians of Knidos from enemy spoils.
On either side of the image of Zeus, they have dedicated images of
Pelops and of the river Alpheios respectively. The greater part of the
city of Knidos is built on the Carian mainland, where are their most
noteworthy possessions, but what is called Chersonnesus is an island
lying near the mainland, to which it is joined by a bridge.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.8">

It is the inhabitants of this quarter who dedicated to Zeus the
offerings at Olympia, just as if Ephesians living in what is called
Koresos were to say that they had dedicated an offering independently of
the Ephesians as a body. There is also by the wall of the Altis a Zeus
turned towards the setting of the sun; it bears no inscription, but is
said to be another offering of Mummius made from the plunder of the
Achaean war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.9">

But the Zeus in the Council Chamber is of all the images of Zeus the one
most likely to strike terror into the hearts of sinners. He is surnamed
Oath-god, and in each hand, he holds a thunderbolt. Beside this image it
is the custom for athletes, their fathers and their brothers, as well as
their trainers, to swear an oath upon slices of boar’s flesh that in
nothing will they sin against the Olympic Games. The athletes take this
further oath also, that for ten successive months they have strictly
followed the regulations for training.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.10">

An oath is also taken by those who examine the boys, or the foals
entering for races, that they will decide fairly and without taking
bribes, and that they will keep secret what they learn about a
candidate, whether accepted or not. I forgot to inquire what it is
customary to do with the boar after the oath of the athletes, though the
ancient custom about victims was that no human being might eat of that
on which an oath had been sworn.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.24.11">

Homer proves this point clearly. For the boar, on the slices of which
Agamemnon swore that Briseis had not lain with him, Homer says was
thrown by the herald into the sea:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

He spoke, and cut the boar’s throat with ruthless bronze;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

plate, with elegiac verses inscribed upon it, the object of which is to
strike fear into those who take false oaths.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.1">

I have enumerated the images of Zeus within the Altis with the greatest
accuracy. For the offering near the great temple, though supposed to be
a likeness of Zeus, is really Alexander, the son of Philip. It was set
up by a Corinthian, not one of the old Corinthians, but one of those
settlers whom the Emperor planted in the city. I shall also mention
those offerings which are of a different kind, and not representations
of Zeus. The statues which have been set up, not to honor a deity, but
to reward mere men, I shall include in my account of the athletes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.2">

The Messenians on the Strait in accordance with an old custom used to
send to Rhēgion a chorus of thirty-five boys, and with it a trainer and
an <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>-player, to a
local festival of Rhēgion. On one occasion, a disaster befell them for
not one of those sent out returned home alive, but the ship with the
boys on board went to the bottom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.3">

The sea in fact at this strait is the stormiest of seas; it is made
rough by winds bringing waves from both sides, from the Adriatic and the
other sea, which is called the Tyrrhenian, and even if there be no gale
blowing, even then the strait of itself produces a very violent swell
and strong currents. So many monsters swarm in the water that even the
air over the sea is infected with their stench. Accordingly, a
shipwrecked man has not even a hope left of getting out of the strait
alive. If it was here that disaster overtook the ship of Odysseus,
nobody could believe that he swam out alive to Italy, were it not that
the benevolence of the gods makes all things easy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.4">

On this occasion the Messenians mourned for the loss of the boys, and
one of the honors bestowed upon them was the dedication of bronze
statues at Olympia, the group including the trainer of the chorus and
the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>-player. The old
inscription declared that the offerings were those of the Messenians at
the strait; but afterwards Hippias, called “a sage” by the Greeks,[^350]
composed the elegiac verses on them. The artist of the statues was
Kallon of Elis.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.5">

At the headland of Sicily that looks towards Libya and the south, called
Pakhynon, there stands the city Motye, inhabited by Libyans and
Phoenicians. Against these barbarians of Motye war was waged by the men
of Akragas, who, having taken from them plunder and spoils, dedicated at
Olympia the bronze boys, who are stretching out their right hands in an
attitude of prayer to the god. They are placed on the wall of the Altis,
and I conjectured that the artist was Kalamis, a conjecture in
accordance with the tradition about them.[^351] Sicily is inhabited by
the following ethnic-groupings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ethnē</span>\]:

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.6">

Sicanians, Sicels, and Phrygians; the first two crossed into it from
Italy, while the Phrygians came from the river Skamandros and the land
of the Troad. The Phoenicians and Libyans came to the island on a joint
expedition, and are settlers from Carthage. Such are the barbarian
ethnic-groupings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ethnē</span>\] in Sicily. The
Greeks settled there include Dorians and Ionians, with a small
proportion of people from Phokis and from Attica.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.7">

On the same wall as the offerings of the People of Akragas are two nude
statues of Hēraklēs as a boy. One represents him shooting the lion at
Nemeā. This Hēraklēs and the lion with him were dedicated by Hippotion
of Tarentum, the artist being Nikodamos of Mainalos. The other image was
dedicated by Anaxippos of Mende, and was transferred to this place by
the Eleians. Previously it stood at the end of the road that leads from
Elis to Olympia, called the Sacred Road.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.8">

There are also offerings dedicated by all the Achaean people in common;
they represent those who, when Hector challenged any Greek to meet him
in single combat, dared to cast lots to choose the champion. They stand,
armed with spears and shields, near the great temple. Right opposite, on
a second pedestal, is a figure of Nestor, who has thrown the lot of each
into the helmet. The number of those casting lots to meet Hector is now
only eight, for the ninth, the statue of Odysseus, they say that Nero
carried to Rome,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.9">

but Agamemnon’s statue is the only one of the eight to have his name
inscribed upon it; the writing is from right to left. The figure with
the rooster emblazoned on the shield is Idomeneus the descendant of
Minos. The story goes that Idomeneus was descended from the Sun, the
father of Pasiphae, and that the rooster is sacred to the Sun and
proclaims when he is about to rise.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.10">

An inscription too is written on the pedestal:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

To Zeus these images were dedicated by the Achaeans,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Descendants of Pelops the godlike offspring of Tantalos.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Such is the inscription on the pedestal, but the name of the artist is
written on the shield of Idomeneus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

This is one of the many works of clever Onatas, The Aeginetan, whose
sire was Mikon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.11">

Not far from the offering of the Achaeans, there is also a Hēraklēs
fighting with the Amazon, a woman on horseback, for her waistband. It
was dedicated by Euagoras, a Zanclaean by descent, and made by
Aristokles of Kydonia. Aristokles should be included amongst the most
ancient sculptors, and though his date is uncertain, he was clearly born
before Zancle took its present name of Messene.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.12">

The Thasians, who are Phoenicians by descent and sailed from Tyre, and
from Phoenicia generally, together with Thasos, the son of Agenor, in
search of Europa, dedicated at Olympia a Hēraklēs, the pedestal as well
as the image being of bronze. The height of the image is ten cubits, and
he holds a club in his right hand and a bow in his left. They told me in
Thasos that they used to worship the same Hēraklēs as the Tyrians, but
that afterwards, when they were included among the Greeks, they adopted
the worship of Hēraklēs the son of Amphitryon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.25.13">

On the offering of the Thasians at Olympia there is an elegiac couplet:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Onatas, son of Mikon, fashioned me,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

He who has his dwelling in Aegina.[^352]

The Dorian Messenian who received Naupaktos from the Athenians dedicated
at Olympia the image of Nike upon the column. It is the work of Paionios
of Mende, and was made from the proceeds of enemy spoils,[^353] I think
from the war with the Arcarnanians and Oiniadai. The Messenians
themselves declare that their offering came from their exploit with the
Athenians in the island of Sphakteria,[^354] and that the name of their
enemy was omitted through dread of the Lacedaemonians; for, they say,
they are not in the least afraid of Oiniadai and the Acarnanians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.26.2">

The offerings of Mikythos I found were numerous and not together. Next
after Iphitos of Elis, and Ekhekheiria garlanding Iphitos, come the
following offerings of Mikythos: Amphitrite, Poseidon, and Hestia; the
artist was Glaukos the Argive.[^355] Along the left side of the great
temple Mikythos dedicated other offerings: the Maiden, daughter of
Demeter, Aphrodite, Ganymedes, and Artemis, the poets Homer and Hesiod,
then again deities, Asklepios and Hygieia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.26.3">

Among the offerings of Mikythos is Struggle carrying jumping-weights,
the shape of which is as follows. They are half of a circle, not an
exact circle but elliptical, and made so that the fingers pass through
as they do through the handle of a shield. Such are the fashion of them.
By the statue of Struggle are Dionysus, Orpheus the Thracian, and an
image of Zeus which I mentioned just now. They are the works of
Dionysius of Argos.[^356] They say that Mikythos set up other offerings
also in addition to these, and that they formed part of the treasures
taken away by Nero.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.26.4">

The artists are said to have been Dionysius and Glaukos, who were
Argives by birth, but the name of their teacher is not recorded. Their
date is fixed by that of Mikythos, who dedicated the works of art at
Olympia. For Herodotus in his
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Histories</span> says that this
Mikythos, when Anaxilas was despot of Rhēgion, became his slave and
steward of his property afterwards, on the death of Anaxilas, he went
away to Tegea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.26.5">

The inscriptions on the offerings give Choerus as the father of
Mikythos, and as his fatherland the Greek cities of Rhēgion and Messene
on the Strait. The inscriptions say that he lived at Tegea, and he
dedicated the offerings at Olympia in fulfillment of a vow made for the
recovery of a son, who fell ill of a wasting disease.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.26.6">

Near to the greater offerings of Mikythos, which were made by the Argive
Glaukos, stands an image of Athena with a helmet on her head and clad in
an <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aegis</span>. Nikodamos of
Mainalos was the artist, but it was dedicated by the Eleians. Beside the
Athena has been set up a Nike. The Mantineians dedicated it, but they do
not mention the war in the inscription. Kalamis is said to have made it
without wings in imitation of the wooden image in Athens called Wingless
Nike.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.26.7">

By the smaller offerings of Mikythos, that were made by Dionysius, are
some of the exploits of Hēraklēs, including what he did to the Nemean
lion, the Hydra, the Hound of Hades, and the boar by the river
Erymanthos. These were brought to Olympia by the people of Herakleia
when they had overrun the land of the Mariandynians, their barbarian
neighbors. Herakleia is a city built on the Euxine Sea, a colony of
Megara, though the people of Tanagra in Boeotia joined in the
settlement.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.1">

Opposite the offerings I have enumerated are others in a row; they face
towards the south, and are very near to that part of the precinct which
is sacred to Pelops. Among them are those dedicated by the Maenalian
Phormis. He crossed to Sicily from Mainalos to serve Gelon the son of
Deinomenes. Distinguishing himself in the campaigns of Gelon and
afterwards of his brother Hieron, he reached such a pitch of prosperity
that he dedicated not only these offerings at Olympia, but also others
dedicated to Apollo at Delphi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.2">

The offerings at Olympia are two horses and two charioteers, a
charioteer standing by the side of each of the horses. The first horse
and man are by Dionysius of Argos, the second are the work of Simon of
Aegina.[^357] On the side of the first of the horses is an inscription,
the first part of which is not metrical. It runs thus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Phormis dedicated me,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

An Arcadian of Mainalos, now of Syracuse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.3">

This is the horse in which is, say the Eleians, the hippomanes (what
maddens horses). It is plain to all that the quality of the horse is the
result of magic skill. It is much inferior in size and beauty to all the
horses standing within the Altis. Moreover, its tail has been cut off
which makes the figure uglier still. But male horses, not only in spring
but on any day, are at heat towards it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.4">

In fact, they rush into the Altis, breaking their tethers or escaping
from their grooms, and they leap upon it much more madly than upon a
living brood mare, even the most beautiful of them. Their hoofs slip
off, but nevertheless they keep on neighing more and more and leap with
a yet more violent passion, until they are driven away by whips and
sheer force. In no other way can they be separated from the bronze
horse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.5">

There is another marvel I know of, having seen it in Lydia; it is
different from the horse of Phormis, but like it not innocent of the
magic art. The Lydians with the surname
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\] of Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persikoi</span>\] have
sanctuaries in the city named Hierocaesareia and at Hypaepa. In each
sanctuary is a chamber, and in the chamber are ashes upon an altar. But
the color of these ashes is not the usual color of ashes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.6">

Entering the chamber, a magician piles dry wood upon the altar; he first
places a tiara upon his head and then sings to some god or other an
invocation in a barbarian tongue unintelligible to Greeks, reciting the
invocation from a book. So it is without fire that the wood must catch,
and bright flames dart from it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.7">

So much for this subject. Among these offerings is Phormis himself
opposed to an enemy, and next are figures of him fighting a second and
again a third. On them it is written that the soldier fighting is
Phormis of Mainalos, and that he who dedicated the offerings was
Lykortas of Syracuse. Clearly, this Lykortas dedicated them out of
friendship for Phormis. These offerings of Lykortas are also called by
the Greeks offerings of Phormis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.8">

The Hermes carrying the ram under his arm, with a helmet on his head,
and clad in tunic and cloak, is not one of the offerings of Phormis, but
has been given to the god by the Arcadians of Pheneus. The inscription
says that the artist was Onatas of Aegina helped by Kalliteles, who I
think was a pupil or son of Onatas. Not far from the offering of the
Pheneatians is another image, Hermes with a herald’s wand. An
inscription on it says that Glaukias, a Rhegian by descent, dedicated
it, and Gallon of Elis made it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.9">

Of the bronze oxen one was dedicated by the Corcyraeans and the other by
the Eretrians. Philesios of Eretria was the artist. Why the Corcyraeans
dedicated the ox at Olympia and another at Delphi will be explained in
my account of Phokis. About the offering at Olympia, I heard the
following story.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.10">

Sitting under this ox a little boy was playing with his head bent
towards the ground. Suddenly lifting his head, he broke it against the
bronze and died a few days later from the wound. So the Eleians were
purposing to remove the ox from out the Altis as being guilty of
bloodshed. But the god at Delphi gave an oracle that they were to let
the offering stay where it was, after performing upon it the
purificatory rites that are customary among the Greeks for unintentional
shedding of blood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.11">

Under the plane trees in the Altis, just about in the center of the
enclosure, there is a bronze trophy, with an inscription upon the shield
of the trophy, to the effect that the Eleians raised it as a sign that
they had beaten the Lacedaemonians. It was in this battle that the
warrior lost his life who was found lying in his armor when the roof of
the Hēraion was being repaired in my time.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:5.27.12">

The offering of the Mendeans in Thrace came very near to beguiling me
into the belief that it was a representation of a competitor in the
pentathlon. It stands by the side of Anauchidas of Elis, and it holds
ancient jumping-weights. An elegiac couplet is written on its thigh:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

To Zeus, king of the gods, as first fruits was I placed here by the
Mendeans, who reduced Sipte by might of hand.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Sipte seems to be a Thracian fortress and city. The Mendeans themselves
are of Greek descent, coming from Ionia, and they live inland at some
distance from the sea that is by the city of Ainos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.1.1">

After my description of the votive offerings, I must now go on to
mention the statues of race-horses and those of men, whether athletes or
ordinary folk. Not all the Olympic victors have had their statues
erected; some, in fact, who have distinguished themselves, either at the
Games or by other exploits, have had no statue.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.1.2">

These I am forced to omit by the nature of my work, which is not a list
of athletes who have won Olympic victories, but an account of statues
and of votive offerings generally. I shall not even record all those
whose statues have been set up, as I know how many have before now won
the garland of wild olive not by strength but by the chance of the
lot.[^358] Those only will be mentioned who themselves gained some
distinction, or whose statues happened to be better made than others.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.1.3">

On the right of the temple of Hērā is the statue of a wrestler,
Symmakhos, the son of Aeschylus. He was an Eleian by birth. Beside him
is Neolaidas, son of Proxenos, from Pheneus in Arcadia, who won a
victory in the boys’ boxing match. Next comes Arkhedamos, son of Xenios,
another Eleian by birth, who like Symmakhos overthrew wrestlers in the
contest for boys. The statues of the athletes mentioned above were made
by Alypos of Sikyon, a pupil of Naukydes of Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.1.4">

The inscription on Kleogenes the son of Silenus declares that he was a
native and that he won a prize with a ridinghorse from his own private
stable. Hard by Kleogenes are set up Deinolokhos, son of Pyrrhos, and
Troilos, son of Alkinoos. They also were both Eleians by birth, though
their victories were not the same. Troilos, at the time that he was
umpire, succeeded in winning victories in the chariot-races, one for a
chariot drawn by a full-grown pair and another for a chariot drawn by
foals. The date of his victories was the hundred and second
Festival.[^359]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.1.5">

After this, the Eleians passed a law that in the future, no umpire was
to compete in the chariotraces. The statue of Troilos was made by
Lysippos. The mother of Deinolokhos had a dream, in which she thought
that the son she clasped in her bosom had a garland on his head. For
this reason, Deinolokhos was trained to compete in the Games and outran
the boys. The artist was Kleon of Sikyon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.1.6">

As for Kyniska, daughter of Arkhidamos, her ancestry and Olympic
victories, I have given an account thereof in my history of the
Lacedaemonian kings.[^360] By the side of the statue of Troilos at
Olympia has been made a basement of stone, on which are a chariot and
horses, a charioteer, and a statue of Kyniska herself, made by Apelles;
there are also inscriptions relating to Kyniska.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.1.7">

Next to her also have been erected statues of Lacedaemonians. They
gained victories in chariot-races. Anaxandros was the first of his
family to be proclaimed victor with a chariot, but the inscription on
him declares that previously his paternal grandfather received the
garland for the pentathlon. Anaxandros is represented in an attitude of
prayer to the god, while Polykles, who gained the surname of
Polykhalkos, likewise won a victory with a four-horse chariot, and his
statue holds a ribbon in the right hand. Beside him are two children;
one holds a wheel and the other is asking for the ribbon. Polykles, as
the inscription on him says, also won the chariot-race at Pythō, the
Isthmus and Nemeā.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.1">

The statue of a competitor in the pankration was made by Lysippos. The
athlete was the first to win the pankration not only from Stratos itself
but from the whole of Acarnania, and his name was Xenarkes, the son of
Philandrides. Now, after the Persian invasion, the Lacedaemonians became
keener breeders of horses than any other Greeks. For beside those I have
already mentioned, the following horse-breeders from Sparta have their
statues set up after that of the Acarnanian athlete Xenarkes,[^361]
Lykinos, Arkesilaos, and Lichas, his son.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.2">

Xenarkes succeeded in winning other victories, at Delphi, at Argos and
at Corinth. Lykinos brought foals to Olympia, and when one of them was
disqualified, entered his foals for the race for full-grown horses,
winning with them. He also dedicated two statues at Olympia, works of
Myron[^362] the Athenian. As for Arkesilaos and his son Lichas, the
father won two Olympic victories; his son, because in his time the
Lacedaemonians were excluded from the Games, entered his chariot in the
name of the Theban people, and with his own hands bound the victorious
charioteer with a ribbon. For this offense, he was scourged by the
umpires,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.3">

and on account of this Lichas, the Lacedaemonians invaded Elis in the
reign of King Agis, when a battle took place within the Altis. When the
war was over, Lichas set up the statue in this place, but the Eleian
records of Olympic victors give as the name of the victor, not Lichas,
but the Theban people.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.4">

Near Lichas stands an Eleian diviner, Thrasyboulos, son of Aeneas of the
Iamid family, who divined for the Mantineians in their struggle against
the Lacedaemonians under Agis, son of Eudamidas, their king. I shall
have more to say about this in my account of the Arcadians.[^363] On the
statue of Thrasyboulos is a spotted lizard crawling towards his right
shoulder, and by his side lies a dog, obviously a sacrificial victim,
cut open and with his liver exposed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.5">

Divination by kids, lambs, or calves has, we all know, been established
among men from ancient times, and the Cyprians have even discovered how
to practice the art by means of pigs; but no peoples are accustomed to
make any use of dogs in divining. So Thrasyboulos apparently established
a method of divination peculiar to himself, by means of the entrails of
dogs. The diviners called Iamidai are descended from Iamos, who, Pindar
says in an ode,[^364] was a son of Apollo and received the gift of
divination from him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.6">

By the statue of Thrasyboulos stands Tīmosthenes of Elis, winner of the
foot-race for boys, and Antipatros of Miletus, son of Kleinopater,
conqueror of the boy boxers. Men of Syracuse, who were bringing a
sacrifice from Dionysius to Olympia, tried to bribe the father of
Antipatros to have his son proclaimed as a Syracusan. But Antipatros,
thinking nothing of the tyrant’s gifts, proclaimed himself a Milesian
and wrote upon his statue that he was of Milesian descent and the first
Ionian to dedicate his statue at Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.7">

The artist who made this statue was Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\], while
that of Tīmosthenes was made by Eutykhides of Sikyon, a pupil of
Lysippos. This Eutykhides made for the Syrians on the Orontes an image
of Fortune, which is highly valued by the natives.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.8">

In the Altis by the side of Tīmosthenes are statues of Timon and of his
son Aesypus, who is represented as a child seated on a horse. In fact,
the boy won the horserace, while Timon was proclaimed victor in the
chariotrace. The statues of Timon and of his son were made by Daidalos
of Sikyon, who also made for the Eleians the trophy in the Altis
commemorating the victory over the Spartans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.9">

The inscription on the Samian boxer says that his trainer Mycon
dedicated the statue and that the Samians are best among the Ionians for
athletes and at naval warfare; this is what the inscription says, but it
tells us nothing at all about the boxer himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.10">

Beside this is the Messenian Damiskos, who won an Olympic victory at the
age of twelve. I was exceedingly surprised to learn that while the
Messenians were in exile from the Peloponnesus, their luck at the
Olympic Games failed. For with the exception of Leontiskos and
Symmakhos, who came from Messene on the Strait, we know of no Messenian,
either from Sicily or from Naupaktos, who won a victory at Olympia. Even
these two are said by the Sicilians to have been not Messenians but of
old Zanclean blood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.2.11">

However, when the Messenians came back to the Peloponnesus, their luck
in the Olympic Games came with them. For at the festival celebrated by
the Eleians in the year after the settlement of Messene, the foot-race
for boys was won by this Damiskos, who afterwards won in the pentathlon
both at Nemeā and at the Isthmus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.1">

Nearest to Damiskos stands a statue of somebody; they do not give his
name, but it was Ptolemy, son of Lagos, who set up the offering. In the
inscription, Ptolemy calls himself a Macedonian, though he was king of
Egypt. On Khaireas of Sikyon, a boy boxer, is an inscription that he won
a victory when a young man, and that his father was Khairemon; the name
of the artist who made the statue is also written, Asterion, son of
Aeschylus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.2">

After Khaireas are statues of a Messenian boy Sophios and of Stomios, a
man of Elis. Sophios outran his boy competitors, and Stomios won a
victory in the pentathlon at Olympia and three at the Nemean Games. The
inscription on his statue adds that, when commander of the Eleian
cavalry, he set up trophies and killed in single combat the general of
the enemy, who had challenged him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.3">

The Eleians say that the dead general was a native of Sikyon in command
of Sikyonian troops, and that they themselves with the force from
Boeotia attacked Sikyon out of friendship to the Thebans. So the attack
of the Eleians and Thebans against Sikyon apparently took place after
the Lacedaemonian disaster at Leuktra.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.4">

Next stands the statue of a boxer from Lepreus in Elis, whose name was
Labax, son of Euphron, and also that of Aristodemos, son of Thrasis, a
boxer from Elis itself, who also won two victories at Pythō. The statue
of Aristodemos is the work of Daidalos of Sikyon, the pupil and son of
Patrokles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.5">

The statue of Hippos of Elis, who won the boys’ boxing-match, was made
by Damokritos of Sikyon, of the school of Attic Critias, being removed
from him by four generations of teachers. For Critias himself taught
Ptolikhos of Corcyra, Amphion was the pupil of Ptolikhos, and taught
Pison of Kalaureia, who was the teacher of Damokritos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.6">

Kratinos of Aigeira in Achaea was the most handsome man of his time and
the most skillful wrestler, and when he won the wrestling-match for
boys, the Eleians allowed him to set up a statue of his trainer as well.
The statue was made by Kantharos of Sikyon, whose father was Alexis,
while his teacher was Eutykhides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.7">

The statue of Eupolemos of Elis was made by Daidalos of Sikyon. The
inscription on it informs us that Eupolemos won the foot-race for men at
Olympia, and that he also received two Pythian garlands for the
pentathlon and another at the Nemean Games. It is also said of Eupolemos
that three umpires stood on the course, of whom two gave their verdict
in favor of Eupolemos and one declared the winner to be Leon the
Ambraciot. Leon, they say, got the Olympic Council to fine each of the
umpires who had decided in favor of Eupolemos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.8">

The statue of Oibotas was set up by the Achaeans by the command of the
Delphic Apollo in the eightieth Olympiad,[^365] but Oibotas won his
victory in the foot-race at the sixth Festival.[^366] How, therefore,
could Oibotas have taken part in the Greek victory at Plataea? For it
was in the seventy-fifth Olympiad[^367] that the Persians under
Mardonios suffered their disaster at Plataea. Now I am obliged to report
the statements made by the Greeks, though I am not obliged to believe
them all. The other incidents in the life of Oibotas I will add to my
history of Achaea.[^368]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.9">

The statue of Antiokhos was made by Nikodamos. A native of Lepreus,
Antiokhos won once at Olympia the pankration for men, and the pentathlon
twice at the Isthmian Games and twice at the Nemean. For the Lepreans
are not afraid of the Isthmian Games as the Eleians themselves are. For
example, Hysmon of Elis, whose statue stands near that of Antiokhos,
competed successfully in the pentathlon both at Olympia and at Nemeā,
but clearly kept away, just like other Eleians, from the Isthmian Games.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.10">

It is said that when Hysmon was still a boy, he was attacked by a flux
in his muscles, and it was in order that by hard exercise, he might be a
healthy man free from disease that he practiced the pentathlon. So his
training was also to make him win famous victories in the Games. His
statue is the work of Kleon, and he holds jumping-weights of old
pattern.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.11">

After Hysmon comes the statue of a boy wrestler from Heraia in Arcadia,
Nikostratos, the son of Xenokleides. Pantias was the artist, and if you
count the teachers, you will find five between him and Aristokles of
Sikyon. Dikon, the son of Kallibrotos, won five foot-races at Pythō,
three at the Isthmian Games, four at Nemeā, and one at Olympia in the
race for boys besides two in the men’s race. Statues of him have been
set up at Olympia equal in number to the races he won. When he was a
boy, he was proclaimed a native of Kaulonia, as in fact he was. But
afterwards, he was bribed to proclaim himself a Syracusan.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.12">

Kaulonia was a colony in Italy founded by Achaeans, and its founder was
Typhon of Aigion. When Pyrrhos son of Aiakidēs and the people of
Tarentum were at war with the Romans, several cities in Italy were
destroyed, either by the Romans or by the people of Epeiros, and these
included Kaulonia, whose fate it was to be utterly laid waste, having
been taken by the Campanians, who formed the largest contingent of
allies on the Roman side.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.13">

Close to Dikon is a statue of a man who won in the pankration: he was
Xenophon, the son of Menephylos, from Aigion in Achaea; there was
likewise a statue of Pyrilampes of Ephesos after winning the long
foot-race. Olympus made the statue of Xenophon; that of Pyrilampes was
made by a sculptor of the same name, a native, not of Sikyon, but of
Messene beneath Ithome.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.14">

A statue of Lysander, son of Aristokritos, a Spartan, was dedicated in
Olympia by the Samians, and the first of their inscriptions runs:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“In the much-seen precinct of Zeus, ruler on high,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

I stand, dedicated at public expense by the Samians.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

So this inscription informs us who dedicated the statue; the next is in
praise of Lysander himself:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Deathless glory by your achievements, for fatherland and for
Aristokritos,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Lysander, have you won, and are famed for valor.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.15">

So plainly “the Samians and the rest of the Ionians,” as the Ionians
themselves phrase it, painted both the walls. For when Alcibiades had a
strong fleet of Athenian triremes along the coast of Ionia, most of the
Ionians paid court to him, and there is a bronze statue of Alcibiades
dedicated by the Samians in the temple of Hērā. But when the Attic ships
were captured at Aigospotamoi,[^369] the Samians set up a statue of
Lysander at Olympia, and the Ephesians set up in the sanctuary of
Artemis not only a statue of Lysander himself but also statues of
Eteonikos, Pharax, and other Spartans quite unknown to the Greek world
generally.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.3.16">

But when fortune changed again, and Konon had won the naval action off
Knidos and the mountain called Dorion,[^370] the Ionians likewise
changed their views, and there are to be seen statues in bronze of Konon
and of Timotheus both in the sanctuary of Hērā in Samos and also in the
sanctuary of the Ephesian goddess at Ephesos. It is always the same; the
Ionians merely follow the example of all the world in deferring to power
.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.1">

Next to the statue of Lysander is an Ephesian boxer who beat the other
boys, his competitors—his name was Athenaios,—and also a man of Sikyon
who was a competitor in the pankration, Sostratos, surnamed
Akrokhersites. He got that surname because he used to grip his
antagonist by the fingers and bend them, and would not let go until he
saw that his opponent had given in.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.2">

He won at the Nemean and Isthmian Games combined twelve victories, three
victories at Olympia, and two at Pythō. The hundred and fourth Festival,
when Sostratos won his first victory, is not reckoned by the Eleians,
because the Games were held by the Pisans and Arcadians and not by
themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.3">

Beside Sostratos is a statue of Leontiskos, a man wrestler, a native of
Sicily from Messene on the Strait. He was garlanded, they say, by the
Amphiktyones and twice by the Eleians, and his mode of wrestling was
similar to the pankration of Sostratos the Sikyonian. For they say that
Leontiskos did not know how to throw his opponents, but won by bending
their fingers.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.4">

The statue was made by Pythagoras of Rhēgion, an excellent sculptor if
ever there was one. They say that he studied under Klearkhos, who was
likewise a native of Rhēgion and a pupil of Eukheiros. Eukheiros, it is
said, was a Corinthian, and attended the school of Syadras and Khartas,
men of Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.5">

The boy who is binding his head with a fillet must be mentioned in my
account because of Pheidias and his great skill as a sculptor, but we do
not know whose portrait the statue is that Pheidias made. Satyros of
Elis, son of Lysianax, of the clan of the Iamidai, won five victories at
Nemeā for boxing, two at Pythō, and two at Olympia. The artist who made
the statue was Silanion, an Athenian. Polykles, another sculptor of the
Attic school, a pupil of Stadieus the Athenian, has made the statue of
an Ephesian boy who competed in the pankration, Amyntas the son of
Hellanikos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.6">

Khilon, an Achaean of Patrai, won two prizes for men wrestlers at
Olympia, one at Delphi, four at the Isthmus, and three at the Nemean
Games. He was buried at the public expense by the Achaeans, and his fate
it was to lose his life on the field of battle. My statement is borne
out by the inscription at Olympia:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“In wrestling only I alone conquered twice the men at Olympia and at
Pythō,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Three times at Nemeā, and four times at the Isthmus near the sea;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Khilon of Patrai, son of Khilon, whom the Achaean folk

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Buried for my valor when I died in battle.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.7">

Thus much is plain from the inscription. But the date of Lysippos, who
made the statue, leads me to infer about the war in which Khilon fell,
that plainly either he marched to Khaironeia with the whole of the
Achaeans,[^371] or else his personal courage and daring led him alone of
the Achaeans to fight against the Macedonians under Antipatros at the
battle of Lamia in Thessaly.[^372]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.8">

Next to Khilon two statues have been set up. One is that of a man named
Molpion, who, says the inscription, was garlanded by the Eleians. The
other statue bears no inscription, but tradition says that it represents
Aristotle from Stageira in Thrace, and that it was set up either by a
pupil or else by some soldier aware of Aristotle’s influence with
Antipatros and at an earlier date with Alexander. Sodamas from Assos in
the Troad,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.9">

a city at the foot of Ida, was the first of the Aeolians in this
district to win at Olympia the foot-race for boys. By the side of
Sodamas stands Arkhidamos, son of Agesilaos, king of the Lacedaemonians.
Before this Arkhidamos, no king, so far as I could learn, had his statue
set up by the Lacedaemonians, at least outside the boundaries of the
country. They sent the statue of Arkhidamos to Olympia chiefly, in my
opinion, on account of his death, because he met his end in a barbarian
land, and is the only king in Sparta who is known to have missed burial.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.10">

I have spoken at greater length on this matter in my account of
Sparta.[^373]

</div>

Euanthes of Kyzikos won prizes for boxing, one among the men at Olympia,
and also among the boys at the Nemean and at the Isthmian Games. By the
side of Euanthes is the statue of a horse-breeder and his chariot;
mounted on the chariot is a young maid. The man’s name is Lampos, and
his native city was the last to be founded in Macedonia, named after its
founder Philip, son of Amyntas.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.4.11">

The statue of Kyniskos, the boy boxer from Mantineia, was made by
Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\]. Ergoteles, the son of Philanor, won two
victories in the long foot-race at Olympia, and two at Pythō, the
Isthmus, and Nemeā. The inscription on the statue states that he came
originally from Himera, but it is said that this is incorrect, and that
he was a Cretan from Knossos. Expelled from Knossos by a political
party, he came to Himera, was given citizenship, and won many honors
besides. It was accordingly natural for him to be proclaimed at the
Games as a native of Himera.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.1">

The statue on the high pedestal is the work of Lysippos, and it
represents the tallest of all men except those called heroes and any
other lineage of mortals that may have existed before the heroes. But
this man, Poulydamas the son of Nikias, is the tallest of our own era.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.2">

Skotoussa, the native city of Poulydamas, has now no inhabitants, for
Alexander the tyrant of Pherai seized it in time of truce. It happened
that an assembly of the citizens was being held, and those who were
assembled in the theater the tyrant surrounded with targeteers and
archers, and shot them all down; all the other grown men he massacred,
selling the women and children as slaves in order to pay his
mercenaries.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.3">

This disaster befell Skotoussa when Phrasikleides was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in
Athens,[^374] in the hundred and second Olympiad, when Damon of Thourioi
was victor for the second time and in the second year of this Olympiad.
The people that escaped remained but for a while, for later they too
were forced by their destitution to leave the city, when the superhuman
force \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] brought
a second calamity in the war with Macedonia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.4">

Others have won glorious victories in the pankration, but Poulydamas,
besides his prizes for the pankration, has to his credit the following
exploits of a different kind. The mountainous part of Thrace, on this
side the river Nestos, which runs through the land of Abdera, breeds
among other wild beasts lions, which once attacked the army of Xerxes
and mauled the camels carrying his supplies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.5">

These lions often roam right into the land around Mount Olympus, one
side of which is turned towards Macedonia, and the other towards
Thessaly and the river Peneios. Here on Mount Olympus, Poulydamas slew a
lion, a huge and powerful beast, without the help of any weapon. To this
exploit he was impelled by an ambition to rival the labors of Hēraklēs,
because Hēraklēs also, it is said, overthrew the lion at Nemeā.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.6">

In addition to this, Poulydamas is remembered for another wonderful
performance. He went among a herd of cattle and seized the biggest and
fiercest bull by one of its hind feet, holding fast the hoof in spite of
the bull’s leaps and struggles, until at last it put forth all its
strength and escaped, leaving the hoof in the grasp of Poulydamas. It is
also said of him that he stopped a charioteer who was driving his
chariot onwards at a great speed. Seizing with one hand the back of the
chariot, he kept a tight hold on both horses and driver.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.7">

Dareios, the bastard son of Artaxerxes, who with the support of the
common-people \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\]
of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] put down
Sogdios, the legitimate son of Artaxerxes, and ascended the throne in
his stead, learning when he was king of the exploits of Poulydamas, sent
messengers with the promise of gifts and persuaded him to come before
his presence at Susa. There he challenged three of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] called
Immortals to fight him—one against three— and killed them. Of his
exploits enumerated, some are represented on the pedestal of the statue
at Olympia, and others are set forth in the inscription.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.8">

But after all, the prophecy of Homer[^375] respecting those who glory in
their strength was to be fulfilled also in the case of Poulydamas, and
he too was fated to perish through his own might. For Poulydamas entered
a cave with the rest of his boon companions. It was summer-time, and as
ill-luck would have it, the roof of the cave began to crack. It was
obvious that it would quickly fall in, and could not hold out much
longer.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.5.9">

Realizing the disaster that was coming, the others turned and ran away;
but Poulydamas resolved to remain, holding up his hands in the belief
that he could prevent the falling in of the cave and would not be
crushed by the mountain. Here Poulydamas met his end.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.1">

Beside the statue of Poulydamas at Olympia stand two Arcadians and one
Attic athlete. The statue of the Mantineian, Protolaos, the son of
Dialkes, who won the boxing match for boys, was made by Pythagoras of
Rhēgion; that of Narykidas, son of Damaretos, a wrestler from Phigalia,
was made by Daidalos of Sikyon; that of the Athenian Kallias, a
competitor in the pankration, is by the Athenian painter Mikon.
Nikodamos the Maenalian made the statue of the Maenalian Androsthenes,
the son of Lokhaios, a competitor in the pankration, who won two
victories among the men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.2">

Next to them is set up a statue of Eukles, son of Kallianax, a native of
Rhodes and of the lineage of the Diagoridai. For he was the son of the
daughter of Diagoras, and won an Olympic victory in the boxing match for
men. His statue is by Naukydes. Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\] of Argos, not
the artist who made the image of Hērā, but a pupil of Naukydes, made the
statue of a boy wrestler, Agenor of Thebes. The statue was dedicated by
the Commonwealth of Phokis, for Theopompos, the father of Agenor, was a
state friend[^376] of their nation.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.3">

Nikodamos, the sculptor from Mainalos, made the statue of the boxer
Damoxenidas of Mainalos. There stands also the statue of the Eleian boy
Lastratidas, who won the garland for wrestling. He won a victory at
Nemeā also among the boys, and another among the beardless youths.
Paraballon, the father of Lastratidas, was first in the double
foot-race, and he left to those coming after an object of ambition, by
writing up in the gymnasium at Olympia the names of those who won
Olympic victories.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.4">

So much for these. But it would not be right for me to pass over the
boxer Euthymos, his victories, and his other glories. Euthymos was by
birth one of the people of Italian Lokris, who dwell in the region near
the headland called the West Point, and he was called son of Astykles.
According to what is said by the local people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\], however,
he is the son not of this man, but of the river Kaikinos, which divides
Lokris from the land of Rhēgion and produces the marvel of the
grasshoppers. For the grasshoppers within Lokris as far as the Kaikinos
sing just like others, but across the Kaikinos in the territory of
Rhēgion, they do not utter a sound.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.5">

This river then, according to tradition, was the father of Euthymos,
who, though he won the prize for boxing at the seventy-fourth Olympic
Festival,[^377] was not to be so successful at the next. For Theagenes
of Thasos, wishing to win the prizes for boxing and for the pankration
at the same Festival, overcame Euthymos at boxing, though he had not the
strength to gain the wild olive in the pankration, because he was
already exhausted in his fight with Euthymos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.6">

Then, the umpires fined Theagenes a talent, to be sacred to the god, and
a talent for the harm done to Euthymos, holding that it was merely to
spite him that he entered for the boxing competition. For this reason,
they condemned him to pay an extra fine privately to Euthymos. At the
seventy-sixth Festival, Theagenes paid in full the money owed to the
god, \[…\] and as compensation to Euthymos did not enter for the boxing
match. At this Festival, and also at the next following, Euthymos won
the garland for boxing. His statue is the handiwork of Pythagoras, and
is very well worth seeing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.7">

On his return to Italy, Euthymos fought against the Hero, the story
about whom is as follows. Odysseus, so they say, in his wanderings after
the capture of Troy was carried down by gales to various cities of Italy
and Sicily, and among them he came with his ships to Temesa. Here one of
his sailors got drunk and violated a girl, for which offense he was
stoned to death by the natives.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.8">

Now Odysseus, it is said, cared nothing about his loss and sailed away.
But the ghost of the stoned man never ceased killing without distinction
the people of Temesa, attacking both old and young, until, when the
inhabitants had resolved to flee from Italy for good, the Pythian
priestess forbade them to leave Temesa, and ordered them to propitiate
the Hero, setting him a sanctuary apart and building a temple, and to
give him every year as wife the fairest maiden in Temesa.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.9">

So they performed the commands of the god and suffered no more terrors
from the ghost. But Euthymos happened to come to Temesa just at the time
when the ghost was being propitiated in the usual way; learning what was
going on, he had a strong desire to enter the temple, and not only to
enter it but also to look at the girl. When he saw her, he first felt
pity and afterwards love for her. The girl swore to marry him if he
saved her, and so Euthymos with his armor on awaited the onslaught of
the ghost.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.10">

He won the fight, and the Hero was driven out of the land and
disappeared, sinking into the depth of the sea. Euthymos had a
distinguished wedding, and the inhabitants were freed from the ghost
forever. I heard another story also about Euthymos, how he reached
extreme old age and escaping again from death, departed from among men
in another way. Temesa is still inhabited, as I heard from a man who
sailed there as a merchant.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.6.11">

This I heard, and I also saw by chance a picture dealing with the
subject. It was a copy of an ancient picture. There were a youth,
Sybaris, a river, Kalabros, and a spring, Lyka. Besides, there were a
hero-shrine and the city of Temesa, and in the midst was the ghost that
Euthymos cast out. Horribly black in color, and exceedingly dreadful in
all his appearance, he had a wolf’s skin thrown round him as a garment.
The letters on the picture gave his name as Lycas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.1">

So much for the story of Euthymos. After his statue stands a runner in
the foot-race, Pytharkhos of Mantineia, and a boxer, Kharmides of Elis,
both of whom won prizes in the contests for boys. When you have looked
at these also, you will reach the statues of the Rhodian athletes,
Diagoras and his family. These were dedicated one after the other in the
following order. Acusilaus \[Akousilaos\], who received a garland for
boxing in the men’s class; Dorieus, the youngest, who won the pankration
at Olympia on three successive occasions. Even before Dorieus, Damagetos
beat all those who had entered for the pankration.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.2">

These were brothers, being sons of Diagoras, and by them is set up also
a statue of Diagoras himself, who won a victory for boxing in the men’s
class. The statue of Diagoras was made by the Megarian Kallikles, the
son of the Theokosmos who made the image of Zeus at Megara. The sons too
of the daughters of Diagoras practiced boxing and won Olympic victories:
in the men’s class, Eukles, son of Kallianax and Kallipateira, daughter
of Diagoras; in the boys’ class, Peisirodos, whose mother dressed
herself as a man and a trainer, and took her son herself to the Olympic
Games.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.3">

This Peisirodos is one of the statues in the Altis, and stands by the
father of his mother. The story goes that Diagoras came to Olympia in
the company of his sons Acusilaus \[Akousilaos\] and Damagetos. The
youths, on defeating their father, proceeded to carry him through the
crowd, while the Greeks pelted him with flowers and congratulated him on
his sons. The lineage of Diagoras was originally, through the female
line, Messenian, as he was descended from the daughter of Aristomenes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.4">

Dorieus, son of Diagoras, besides his Olympian victories, won eight at
the Isthmian and seven at the Nemean Games. He is also said to have won
a Pythian victory without a contest. He and Peisirodos were proclaimed
by the herald as of Thourioi, for they had been pursued by their
political enemies from Rhodes to Thourioi in Italy. Dorieus subsequently
returned to Rhodes. Of all men, he most obviously showed his friendship
with Sparta, for he actually fought against the Athenians with his own
ships, until he was taken prisoner by Attic men-of-war and brought alive
to Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.5">

Before he was brought to them, the Athenians were angry with Dorieus and
used threats against him; but when they met in the assembly and beheld a
man so great and famous in the guise of a prisoner, their feeling
towards him changed, and they let him go away without doing him any
hurt, even though they might with justice have punished him severely.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.6">

The death of Dorieus is told by Androtion in his Attic history. He says
that the great King’s fleet was then at Kaunos, with Konon in command,
who persuaded the Rhodian people to leave the Lacedaemonian alliance and
to join the great King and the Athenians. Dorieus, he goes on to say,
was at the time away from home in the interior of the Peloponnesus, and
having been caught by some Lacedaemonians, he was brought to Sparta,
convicted of treachery by the Lacedaemonians, and sentenced to death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.7">

If Androtion tells the truth, he appears to me to wish to put the
Lacedaemonians on a level with the Athenians, because they too are open
to the charge of precipitous action in their treatment of Thrasyllos and
his fellow admirals at the battle of Arginoussai.[^378] Such was the
fame won by Diagoras and his family.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.8">

Alkainetos too, son of Theantos, a Leprean, himself and his sons won
Olympian victories. Alkainetos was successful in the boxing contest for
men, as at an earlier date, he had been in the contest for boys. His
sons, Helianikos and Theantos, were proclaimed winners of the boys’
boxing match, Hellanikos at the eighty-ninth Festival[^379] and Theantos
at the next. All have their statues set up at Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.9">

Next to the sons of Alkainetos stand Gnathon, a Maenalian of Dipaia, and
Lukinos of Elis. They too succeeded in beating the boys at boxing at
Olympia. The inscription on his statue says that Gnathon was very young
indeed when he won his victory. The artist who made the statue was
Kallikles of Megara.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.7.10">

A man from Stymphalos, by name Dromeus \[Runner\], proved true to it in
the long race, for he won two victories at Olympia, two at Pythō, three
at the Isthmus, and five at Nemeā. He is said to have also conceived the
idea of a flesh diet; up to this time, athletes had fed on cheese from
the basket. The statue of this athlete is by Pythagoras; the one next to
it, representing Pythokles, a pentathlete of Elis, was made by
Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.8.1">

Socrates of Pellene won the boys’ race, and Amertes of Elis the
wrestlers’ match for boys at Olympia, besides beating all competitors in
the men’s wrestling match at Pythō. It is not said who made the statue
of Socrates, but that of Amertes is from the band of Phradmon of Argos.
Euanoridas of Elis won the boys’ wrestling match both at Olympia and at
Nemeā. When he was made an umpire, he joined the ranks of those who have
recorded at Olympia the names of the victors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.8.2">

As to the boxer, by name Damarkhos, an Arcadian of Parrhasia, I cannot
believe (except, of course, his Olympic victory) what romancers say
about him, how he changed his shape into that of a wolf at the sacrifice
of Lycaean \[Wolf\] Zeus, and how nine years after he became a man
again. Nor do I think that the Arcadians either record this of him,
otherwise it would have been recorded as well in the inscription at
Olympia, which runs:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“This statue was dedicated by Damarkhos, son of Dinytas,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Parrhasian by birth from Arcadia.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.8.3">

Here the inscription ends. Eubotas of Cyrene, when the Libyan oracle
foretold to him his coming Olympic victory for running, had his portrait
statue made beforehand, and so was proclaimed victor and dedicated the
statue on the same day. He is also said to have won the chariot-race at
that Festival which, according to the account of the Eleians, was not
genuine because the Arcadians presided at it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.8.4">

The statue of Timanthes of Kleonai, who won the garland in the
pankration for men, was made by Myron of Athens, but Naukydes made that
of Baukis of Troizen, who overthrew the men wrestlers. Timanthes, they
say, met his end through the following cause. On retiring from
athletics, he continued to test his strength by drawing a great bow
every day. His practice with the bow was interrupted during a period
when he was away from home. On his return, finding that he was no longer
able to bend the bow, he lit a fire and threw himself alive on to it. In
my view all such deeds, whether they have already occurred among men or
will take place hereafter, ought to be regarded as acts of madness
rather than of courage.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.8.5">

After Baukis are statues of Arcadian athletes: Euthymenes from Mainalos
itself, who won the men’s and previously the boys’ wrestling match;
Philip, an Azanian from Pellana, who beat the boys at boxing, and
Kritodamos from Kleitor, who like Philip was proclaimed victor in the
boys’ boxing match. The statue of Euthymenes for his victory over the
boys was made by Alypos; the statue of Damokritos was made by Kleon, and
that of Philip the Azanian by Myron. The story of a competitor in the
pankration who was named Promakhos, son of Dryon, from Pellene, will be
included in my account of the Achaeans.[^380]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.8.6">

Not far from Promakhos is set up the statue of Timasitheos, a Delphian
by birth, the work of Ageladas of Argos. This athlete won in the
pankration two victories at Olympia and three at Pythō. His achievements
in war too are distinguished by their daring and by the good luck which
attended all but the last, which caused his death. For when Isagoras the
Athenian captured the Acropolis of the Athenians with a view of setting
up a tyranny, Timasitheus took part in the affair, and, on being taken
prisoner on the Acropolis, was put to death by the Athenians for his sin
against them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.1">

Theognetos of Aegina succeeded in winning the garland for the boys’
wrestling match, and Ptolikhos of Aegina made his statue. Ptolikhos was
a pupil of his father Synnoön, and he of Aristokles the Sikyonian, a
brother of Kanakhos and almost as famous an artist. Why Theognetos
carries a cone of the cultivated pine and a pomegranate I could not
conjecture; perhaps some of the Aeginetans may have a local story about
it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.2">

After the statue of the man who the Eleians say had not his name
recorded with the others because he was proclaimed winner of the
trotting-race, stand Xenokles of Mainalos, who overthrew the boys at
wrestling, and Alketos, son of Alkinoos, victor in the boys’ boxing
match, who also was an Arcadian from Kleitor. Kleon made the statue of
Alketos; that of Xenokles is by Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.3">

Aristeus of Argos himself won a victory in the long-race, while his
father Kheimon won the wrestling match. They stand near to each other,
the statue of Aristeus being by Pantias of Chios, the pupil of his
father, Sostratos. Besides the statue of Kheimon at Olympia, there is
another in the temple of Peace at Rome, brought there from Argos. Both
are in my opinion among the most glorious works of Naukydes. It is also
told how Kheimon overthrew at wrestling Taurosthenes of Aegina, how
Taurosthenes at the next Festival overthrew all who entered for the
wrestling match, and how an apparition that looked like Taurosthenes
appeared on that day in Aegina and announced the victory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.4">

The statue of Philles of Elis, who won the boys’ wrestling match, was
made by the Spartan Kratinos. As regards the chariot of Gelon, I did not
come to the same opinion about it as my predecessors, who hold that the
chariot is an offering of the Gelon who became tyrant in Sicily. Now
there is an inscription on the chariot that it was dedicated by Gelon of
Gela, son of Deinomenes, and the date of the victory of this Gelon is
the seventy-third Festival.[^381]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.5">

But the Gelon who was tyrant of Sicily took possession of Syracuse when
Hybrilides was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the second year of the seventy-second Olympiad,[^382] when Tisikrates of
Croton won the foot-race. Plainly, therefore, he would have announced
himself as of Syracuse, not Gela. The fact is that this Gelon must be a
private person, of the same name as the tyrant, whose father had the
same name as the tyrant’s father. It was Glaukias of Aegina who made
both the chariot and the portrait-statue of Gelon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.6">

At the Festival previous to this, it is said that Kleomedes of
Astypalaia killed Ikkos of Epidaurus during a boxing match. On being
convicted by the umpires of foul play and being deprived of the prize,
he became mad through grief and returned to Astypalaia. Attacking a
school there of about sixty children, he pulled down the pillar which
held up the roof.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.7">

This fell upon the children, and Kleomedes, pelted with stones by the
citizens, took refuge in the sanctuary of Athena. He entered a chest
standing in the sanctuary and drew down the lid. The Astypalaians toiled
in vain in their attempts to open the chest. At last, however, they
broke open the boards of the chest, but found no Kleomedes, either alive
or dead. So they sent envoys to Delphi to ask what had happened to
Kleomedes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.8">

The response given by the Pythian priestess was, they say, as follows:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Last of heroes is Kleomedes of Astypalaia;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Honor him with sacrifices as being no longer a mortal.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

So from this time have the Astypalaians paid honors to Kleomedes as to a
hero.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.9.9">

By the side of the chariot of Gelon is dedicated a statue of Philon, the
work of the Aeginetan Glaukias. About this, Philon Simonides, the son of
Leoprepes composed a very neat elegiac couplet:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“My fatherland is Corcyra, and my name is Philon; I am

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The son of Glaukos, and I won two Olympic victories for boxing.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

There is also a statue of Agametor of Mantineia, who beat the boys at
boxing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.10.1">

Next

to those that I have enumerated stands Glaukos of Karystos. It is said
that he was by birth from Anthedon in Boeotia, being descended from
Glaukos the sea deity. This Carystian was a son of Demylos, and they say
that to begin with he worked as a farmer. The ploughshare one day fell
out of the plough, and he fitted it into its place, using his hand as a
hammer.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.10.2">

Demylos happened to be a spectator of his son’s performance, and
thereupon brought him to Olympia to box. There Glaukos, inexperienced in
boxing, was wounded by his antagonists, and when he was boxing with the
last of them, he was thought to be fainting from the number of his
wounds. Then they say that his father called out to him, “Son, the
plough touch.” So he dealt his opponent a more violent blow which right
away brought him the victory.

</div>

He is said to have won other garlands besides, two at Pythō, eight at
the Nemean and eight at the Isthmian Games. The statue of Glaukos was
set up by his son, while Glaukias of Aegina made it. The statue
represents a figure sparring, as Glaukos was the best exponent of the
art of all his contemporaries. When he died the people of Karystos, they
say, buried him in the island still called the island of Glaukos.

Damaretos of Heraia, his son, and his grandson, each won two victories
at Olympia. Those of Damaretos were gained at the sixty-fifth
Festival[^383] (at which the race in full armor was instituted) and also
at the one succeeding. His statue shows him, not only carrying the
shield that modern competitors have, but also wearing a helmet on his
head and greaves on his legs. In course of time, the helmet and greaves
were taken from the armor of competitors by both the Eleians and the
Greeks generally. Theopompos, son of Damaretos, won his victories in the
pentathlon, and his son Theopompos the second, named after his father,
won his in the wrestling match.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.10.5">

Who made the statue of Theopompos the wrestler we do not know, but those
of his father and grandfather are said by the inscription to be by
Eutelidas and Khrysothemis, who were Argives. It does not, however,
declare the name of their teacher, but runs as follows:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Eutelidas and Khrysothemis made these works,

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Argives, who learned their art from those who lived before.”

Ikkos, the son of Nikolaidas of Tarentum, won the Olympic garland in the
pentathlon and afterwards is said to have become the best trainer of his
day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.10.6">

After Ikkos stands Pantarkes the Eleian, beloved of Pheidias, who beat
the boys at wrestling. Next to Pantarkes is the chariot of Kleosthenes,
a man of Epidamnus. This is the work of Ageladas, and it stands behind
the Zeus dedicated by the Greeks from the spoil of the battle of
Plataea. Kleosthenes’ victory occurred at the sixty-sixth Festival, and
together with the statues of his horses, he dedicated a statue of
himself and one of his charioteer.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.10.7">

There are inscribed the names of the horses, Phoenix and Korax, and on
either side are the horses by the yoke, on the right Knakias, on the
left Samos. This inscription in elegiac verse is on the chariot:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Kleosthenes, son of Pontis, a native of Epidamnus, dedicated me

After winning with his horses a victory in the glorious Games of Zeus.”

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.10.8">

This Kleosthenes was the first of those who bred horses in Greece to
dedicate his statue at Olympia. For the offering of agoras the Laconian
consists of the chariot without a figure of agoras himself; the
offerings of Miltiades the Athenian, which he dedicated at Olympia, I
will describe in another part of my story.[^384] The Epidamnians occupy
the same territory today as they did at first, but the modern city is
not the ancient one, being at a short distance from it. The modern city
is called Dyrrhachium from its founder.

Lykinos of Heraia, Epikradios of Mantineia, Tellon of Oresthas, and
Agiadas of Elis won victories in boys’ matches; Lykinos for running, the
rest of them for boxing. The artist who made the statue of iosEpikradios
was Ptolikhos of Aegina; that of Agiadas was made by Serambos, also a
native of Aegina. The statue of Lykinos is the work of Kleon. Who made
the statue of Tellon is not related.

Next to these are offerings of Eleians, representing Philip, the son of

Antigonos is on foot; the rest are on horseback.

Not far from the kings mentioned stands a Thasian, Theagenes the son of
Tīmosthenes. The Thasians say that Tīmosthenes was not the father of
Theagenes, but a priest of the Thasian Hēraklēs, a phantom of whom in
the likeness of Tīmosthenes had intercourse with the mother of
Theagenes. In his ninth year, they say, as he was going home from
school, he was attracted by a bronze image of some god or other in the
marketplace; so he caught up the image, placed it on one of his
shoulders, and carried it home.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.11.3">

The citizens were enraged at what he had done, but one of them, a
respected man of advanced years, ordered them not to kill the boy, and
ordered him to carry the image from his home back again to the
marketplace. This he did, and at once became famous for his strength,
his feat being talked about abroad throughout Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.11.4">

The achievements of Theagenes at the Olympian Games have already—the
most famous of them—been described[^385] in my story, how he beat
Euthymos the boxer, and how he was fined by the Eleians. On this
occasion, the pankration, it is said, was for the first time on record
won without a contest, the victor being Dromeus of Mantineia. At the
Festival following this, Theagenes was the winner in the pankration.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.11.5">

He also won three victories at Pythō. These were for boxing, while nine
prizes at Nemeā and ten at the Isthmus were won in some cases for the
pankration and in others for boxing. At Phthia in Thessaly, he gave up
training for boxing and the pankration. He devoted himself to winning
fame among the Greeks for his running also, and beat those who entered
for the long race. His ambition was, I think, to rival Achilles by
winning a prize for running in the fatherland of the swiftest of those
who are called heroes. The total number of garlands that he won was one
thousand four hundred.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.11.6">

When he departed this life, one of those who were his enemies while he
lived came every night to the statue of Theagenes and flogged the bronze
as though he were ill-treating Theagenes himself. The statue put an end
to the outrage by falling on him, but the sons of the dead man
prosecuted the statue for murder. So the Thasians dropped the statue to
the bottom of the sea, adopting the principle of Draco, who, when he
framed for the Athenians laws to deal with homicide, inflicted
banishment even on lifeless things, should one of them fall and kill a
man.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.11.7">

But in course of time, when the earth yielded no crop to the Thasians,
they sent envoys to Delphi, and the god instructed them to receive back
the exiles. At this command, they received them back, but their
restoration brought no remedy of the famine. So for the second time,
they went to the Pythian priestess, saying that although they had obeyed
her instructions, the wrath of the gods still abode with them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.11.8">

Whereupon the Pythian priestess replied to them:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“But you have forgotten your great Theagenes.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

And when they could not think of a contrivance to recover the statue of
Theagenes, fishermen, they say, after putting out to sea for a catch of
fish caught the statue in their net and brought it back to land. The
Thasians set it up in its original position, and are accustomed to
sacrifice to him as to a god.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.11.9">

There are many other places that I know of, both among Greeks and among
barbarians, where images of Theagenes have been set up, who cures
diseases and receives honors from the natives. The statue of Theagenes
is in the Altis, being the work of Glaukias of Aegina.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.1">

Hard by is a bronze chariot with a man mounted upon it; race-horses, one
on each side, stand beside the chariot, and on the horses are seated
boys. They are memorials of Olympic victories won by Hieron, the son of
Deinomenes, who was tyrant of Syracuse after his brother Gelo. But the
offerings were not sent by Hieron; it was Hieron’s son Deinomenes who
gave them to the god, Onatas the Aeginetan who made the chariot, and
Kalamis who made the horses on either side and the boys on them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.2">

By the chariot of Hieron is a man of the same name as the son of
Deinomenes. He too was tyrant of Syracuse, and was called Hieron, the
son of Hierokles. After the death of Agathokles, a former tyrant,
tyranny again sprung up at Syracuse in the person of this Hieron, who
came to power in the second year of the hundred and twenty-sixth
Olympiad,[^386] at which Festival Idaios of Cyrene won the foot race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.3">

This Hieron made an alliance with Pyrrhos the son of Aiakidēs, sealing
it by the marriage of Gelo, his son, and Nereis, the daughter of
Pyrrhos. When the Romans went to war with Carthage for the possession of
Sicily, the Carthaginians held more than half the island, and Hieron
sided with them at the beginning of the war. Shortly after, however, he
changed over to the Romans, thinking that they were stronger, and firmer
and more reliable friends.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.4">

He met his end at the hands of Deinomenes, a Syracusan by birth and an
inveterate enemy of tyranny, who afterwards, when Hippokrates the
brother of Epikydes had just come from Erbessus to Syracuse and was
beginning to harangue the multitude, rushed at him with intent to kill
him. But Hippokrates withstood him, and certain of the bodyguard
overpowered and slew Deinomenes. The statues of Hieron at Olympia, one
on horseback and the other on foot, were dedicated by the sons of
Hieron, the artist being Mikon, a Syracusan, the son of Nikeratos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.5">

After the likenesses of Hieron stand Areus the Lacedaemonian king, the
son of Akrotatos, and Aratos, the son of Kleinias with another statue of
Areus on horseback. The statue of Aratos was dedicated by the
Corinthians, that of Areus by the people of Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.6">

I have already given some account of both Aratos and Areus,[^387] and
Aratos was also proclaimed at Olympia as victor in the chariot race.
Timon, an Eleian, the son of Aisypos, entered a four-horse chariot for
the Olympic races \[…\] this is of bronze, and on it is mounted a
maiden, who, in my opinion, is Victory. Kallon, the son of Harmodios,
and Hippomakhos, the son of Moschion, Eleian by lineage, were victors in
the boys’ boxing match. The statue of Kallon was made by Daippos; who
made that of Hippomakhos I do not know, but it is said that he overcame
three antagonists without receiving a blow or any physical injury.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.7">

Theokhrestos of Cyrene bred horses after the traditional Libyan manner;
he himself and before him his paternal grandfather of the same name won
victories at Olympia with the four-horse chariot, while the father of
Theokhrestos won a victory at the Isthmus. So declares the inscription
on the chariot.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.8">

The elegiac verses bear witness that Agesarkhos of Triteia, the son of
Haimostratos, won the boxing match for men at Olympia, Nemeā, Pythō, and
the Isthmus; they also declare that the Tritaeans are Arcadians, but I
found this statement to be untrue. For the founders of the Arcadian
cities that attained to fame have well-known histories; while those that
had all along been obscure because of their weakness were surely
absorbed for this very reason into Megalopolis, being included in the
decree then made by the Arcadian confederacy;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.12.9">

no other city Triteia, except the one in Achaea, is to be found in
Greece. However, one may assume that at the time of the inscription, the
Tritaeans were reckoned as Arcadians, just as nowadays too certain of
the Arcadians themselves are reckoned as Argives. The statue of
Agesarkhos is the work of the sons of Polykles, of whom we shall give
some account later on.[^388]

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.1">

The statue of Astylos of Kroton is the work of Pythagoras; this athlete
won three successive victories at Olympia, in the short race and in the
double race. But because on the two latter occasions he proclaimed
himself a Syracusan, in order to please Hieron, the son of Deinomenes,
the people of Kroton for this condemned his house to be a prison, and
pulled down his statue set up by the temple of Lacinian Hērā.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.2">

There is also set up in Olympia a slab recording the victories of
Khionis the Lacedaemonian. They show simplicity who have supposed that
Khionis himself dedicated the slab, and not the Lacedaemonian people.
Let us assume that, as the slab says, the race in armor had not yet been
introduced; how could Khionis know whether the Eleians would at some
future time add it to the list of events? But those are simpler still
who say that the statue standing by the slab is a portrait of Khionis,
it being the work of the Athenian Myron.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.3">

Similar in renown to Khionis was Hermogenes of Xanthos, a Lydian, who
won the wild olive eight times at three Olympic festivals, and was
surnamed Horse by the Greeks. Polites also you will consider a great
marvel. This Polites was from Keramos in Caria, and showed at Olympia
every excellence in running. For from the longest race, demanding the
greatest stamina, he changed, after the shortest interval, to the
shortest and quickest, and after winning a victory in the long race and
immediately afterwards in the short race, he added on the same day a
third victory in the double course.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.4">

Polites then in the second \[…\] and four, as they are grouped together
by lot, and they do not start them all together for the race. The
victors in each heat run again for the prize. So he who is garlanded in
the foot race will be victorious twice. However, the most famous runner
was Leonidas of Rhodes. He maintained his speed at its prime for four
Olympiads, and won twelve victories for running.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.5">

Not far from the slab of Khionis at Olympia stands Scaios, the son of
Douris, a Samian, victor in the boys’ boxing match. The statue is the
work of Hippias, the son of \[…\] and the inscription on it states that
Scaios won his victory at the time when the people of Samos were in
exile from the island, but the occasion \[…\] the people to their own.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.6">

By the side of the tyrant is a statue of Diallos, the son of Pollis, a
Smyrnean by descent, and this Diallos declares that he was the first
Ionian to receive at Olympia a garland for the boys’ pankration. There
are statues of Thersilokhos of Corcyra and of Aristion of Epidaurus, the
son of Theophiles, made by Polyclitus \[Polykleitos\] the Argive;
Aristion won a garland for the men’s boxing, Thersilokhos for the boys’.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.7">

Bykelos, the first Sikyonian to win the boys’ boxing match, had his
statue made by Kanakhos of Sikyon, a pupil of the Argive Polyclitus
\[Polykleitos\]. By the side of Bykelos stands the statue of a
man-at-arms, Mnaseas of Cyrene, surnamed the Libyan; Pythagoras of
Rhēgion made the statue. To Agemakhos of Kyzikos from the mainland of
Asia \[…\] the inscription on it shows that he was born at Argos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.8">

Naxos was founded in Sicily by the people of Khalkis-on-the-Euripos. Of
the city not even the ruins are now to be seen, and that the name of
Naxos has survived to after ages must be attributed to Tisandros, the
son of Kleokritos. He won the men’s boxing match at Olympia four times;
he had the same number of victories at Pythō, but at this time, neither
the Corinthians nor the Argives kept complete records of the victors at
Nemeā and the Isthmus.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.9">

The mare of the Corinthian Pheidolas was called, the Corinthians relate,
Aura ‘breeze’, and at the beginning of the race, she chanced to throw
her rider. But nevertheless, she went on running properly, turned round
the post, and, when she heard the trumpet, quickened her pace, reached
the umpires first, realized that she had won, and stopped running. The
Eleians proclaimed Pheidolas the winner and allowed him to dedicate a
statue of this mare.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.10">

The sons also of Pheidolas were winners in the horse race, and the horse
is represented on a slab with this inscription:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“The swift Lykos by one victory at the Isthmus and two here

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Garlanded the house of the sons of Pheidolas.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

But the inscription is at variance with the Eleian records of Olympic
victors. These records give a victory to the sons of Pheidolas at the
sixty-eighth Festival but at no other. You may take my statements as
accurate.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.13.11">

There are statues to Agathinos, son of Thrasyboulos, and to Telemakhos,
both men of Elis. Telemakhos won the race for four-horse chariots; the
statue of Agathinos was dedicated by the Achaeans of Pellene. The
Athenian people dedicated a statue of Aristophon, the son of Lysinos,
who won the men’s pankration at Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.1">

Pherias of Aegina, whose statue stands by the side of Aristophon the
Athenian, at the seventy-eighth Festival was considered very young, and,
being judged to be as yet unfit to wrestle, was debarred from the
contest. Out at the next Festival, he was admitted to the boys’
wrestling match and won it. What happened to this Pherias was different,
in fact the exact opposite of what happened at Olympia to Nicasylus of
Rhodes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.2">

Being eighteen years of age, he was not allowed by the Eleians to
compete in the boys’ wrestling match, but won the men’s match and was
proclaimed victor. He was afterwards proclaimed victor at Nemeā also and
at the Isthmus. But when he was twenty years old, he met his death
before he returned home to Rhodes. The feat of the Rhodian wrestler at
Olympia was in my opinion surpassed by Artemidoros of Tralles. He failed
in the boys’ pankration at Olympia, the reason of his failure being his
extreme youth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.3">

When, however, the time arrived for the contest held by the Ionians of
Smyrna, his strength had so increased that he beat in the pankration on
the same day those who had competed with him at Olympia, after the boys
the beardless youths as they are called, and thirdly the pick of the
men. His match with the beardless youths was the outcome, they say, of a
trainer’s encouragement; he fought the men because of the insult of a
man who was a competitor at the pankration. Artemidoros won an Olympic
victory among the men at the two hundred and twelfth Festival.[^389]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.4">

Next to the statue of Nicasylus is a small bronze horse, which Crocon of
Eretria dedicated when he won a garland with a race-horse. Near the
horse is Telestas of Messene, who won the boys’ boxing match. The artist
who represented Telestas was Silanion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.5">

The statue of Milo, the son of Diotīmos, was made by Dameas, also a
native of Kroton. Milo won six victories for wrestling at Olympia, one
of them among the boys; at Pythō, he won six among the men and one among
the boys. He came to Olympia to wrestle for the seventh time, but did
not succeed in mastering Timasitheus, a fellow citizen who was also a
young man, and who refused, moreover, to come to close quarters with
him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.6">

It is further stated that Milo carried his own statue into the Altis.
His feats with the pomegranate and the discus are also remembered by
tradition. He would grasp a pomegranate so firmly that nobody could
wrest it from him by force, and yet he did not damage it by pressure. He
would stand upon a greased discus, and make fools of those who charged
him and tried to push him from the discus. He used to perform also the
following exhibition feats.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.7">

He would tie a cord around his forehead as though it were a ribbon or a
garland. Holding his breath and filling with blood the veins on his
head, he would break the cord by the strength of these veins. It is said
that he would let down by his side his right arm from the shoulder to
the elbow, and stretch out straight the arm below the elbow, turning the
thumb upwards, while the other fingers lay in a row. In this position,
then, the little finger was lowest, but nobody could bend it back by
pressure.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.8">

They say that he was killed by wild beasts. The story has it that he
came across in the land of Kroton a tree-trunk that was drying up;
wedges were inserted to keep the trunk apart. Milo in his pride thrust
his hands into the trunk, the wedges slipped, and Milo was held fast by
the trunk until the wolves—beasts that roves in vast packs in the land
of Kroton—made him their prey.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.9">

Such was the fate that overtook Milo. Pyrrhos, the son of Aiakidēs, who
was king on the Thesprotian mainland and performed many remarkable
deeds, as I have related in my account of the Athenians,[^390] had his
statue dedicated by Thrasyboulos of Elis. Beside Pyrrhos is a little man
holding an <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>
\[‘double-reed’\], carved in relief upon a slab. This man won Pythian
victories next after Sacadas of Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.10">

For Sacadas won in the Games introduced by the Amphiktyones before a
garland was awarded for success, and after this victory two others for
which garlands were given, but at the next six Pythian Festivals
Pythokritos of Sikyon was victor, being the only
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> player so to
distinguish himself. It is also clear that at the Olympic Festival, he
fluted six times for the pentathlon. For these reasons, the slab at
Olympia was erected in honor of Pythokritos, with the inscription on it:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“This is the monument of the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> player Pythokritos,
the son of Kallinikos.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.11">

The Aetolian League dedicated a statue of Kylon, who delivered the
Eleians from the tyranny of Aristotīmos. The statue of Gorgos, the son
of Eukletos, a Messenian who won a victory in the pentathlon, was made
by the Boeotian Theron; that of Damaretos, another Messenian, who won
the boys’ boxing match, was made by the Athenian Silanion. Anauchidas,
the son of Philys, an Eleian, won a garland in the boys’ wrestling match
and afterwards in the match for men. Who made his statue is not known,
but Ageladas of Argos made the statue of Anochus of Tarentum, the son of
Adamatas, who won victories in the short and double foot race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.12">

A boy seated on a horse and a man standing by the horse the inscription
declares to be Xenombrotos of Meropian Kos, who was proclaimed victor in
the horse race, and Xenodikos, who was announced a winner in the boys’
boxing match. The statue of the latter is by Pantias, that of the former
is by Philotīmos the Aeginetan. The two statues of Pythes, the son of
Andromakhos, a native of Abdera, were made by Lysippos, and were
dedicated by his soldiers. Pythes seems to have been a captain of
mercenaries or some sort of distinguished soldier.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.14.13">

There are statues of winners of the boys’ race, namely, Meneptolemos of
Apollonia on the Ionian Gulf and Philo of Corcyra; also Hieronymos of
Andros, who defeated in the pentathlon at Olympia Tisamenus of Elis, who
afterwards served as soothsayer in the Greek army that fought against
Mardonios and the Persians at Plataea. By the side of this Hieronymos is
a statue of a boy wrestler, also of Andros, Prokles, the son of
Lycastidas. The sculptor who made the statue of Lycastidas was named
Stomios, while Somis made the statue of Prokles. Aeschines of Elis won
two victories in the pentathlon, and his statues are also two in number.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.1">

Arkhippos of Mitylene overcame his competitors in the men’s boxing
match, and his fellow-townsmen hold that he added to his fame by winning
the garland when he was not more than twenty years old, at Olympia, at
Pythō, at Nemeā, and at the Isthmus. The statue of the boy runner Xenon,
son of Kalliteles from Lepreus in Triphylia, was made by Pyrilampes the
Messenan; who made the statue of Kleinomakhos of Elis, I do not know,
but Kleinomakhos was proclaimed victor in the pentathlon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.2">

The inscription on the statue of Pantarkes of Elis states that it was
dedicated by Achaeans, because he made peace between them and the
Eleians and procured the release of those who had been made prisoners by
both sides during the war. This Pantarkes also won a victory with a
race-horse, and there is a memorial of his victory also at Olympia. The
statue of Olidas, of Elis, was dedicated by the Aetolian nation, and
Kharinos of Elis is represented in a statue dedicated for a victory in
the double race and in the race in armor. By his side is Ageles of
Chios, victorious in the boys’ boxing match, the artist being
Theomnestos of Sardes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.3">

The statue of Kleitomakhos of Thebes was dedicated by his father
Hermokrates, and his famous deeds are these. At the Isthmus, he won the
men’s wrestling match, and on the same day, he overcame all competitors
in the boxing match and in the pankration. His victories at Pythō were
all in the pankration, three in number. At Olympia, this Kleitomakhos
was the first after Theagenes of Thasos to be proclaimed victor in both
boxing and the pankration.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.4">

He won his victory in the pankration at the hundred and forty-first
Olympic Festival.[^391] The next Festival saw this Kleitomakhos a
competitor in the pankration and in boxing, while Kapros of Elis was
minded both to wrestle and to compete in the pankration on the same day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.5">

After Kapros had won in the wrestling match, Kleitomakhos put it to the
umpires that it would be fair if they were to bring in the pankration
before he received wounds in the boxing. His request seemed reasonable,
and so the pankration was brought in. Although Kleitomakhos was defeated
by Kapros, he tackled the boxers with sturdy spirit and unwearied vigor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.6">

The Ionians of Erythraidedicated a statue of Epitherses, son of
Metrodoros, who won two boxing prizes at Olympia, two at Pythō, and also
victories at Nemeā and the Isthmus; the Syracusans dedicated two statues
of Hieron at the public charge, while a third is the gift of Hieron’s
sons. I pointed out in a recent chapter[^392] how this Hieron had the
same name as the son of Deinomenes, and, like him, was despot of
Syracuse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.7">

The Paleans, who form one of the four divisions of the Cephallenians,
dedicated a statue of Timoptolis, an Eleian, the son of Lampis. These
Paleans were of old called Dulichians. There is also a statue set up of
Arkhidamos, the son of Agesilaos, and of some man or other representing
a hunter. There is a statue of Demetrios, who made an expedition against
Seleukos and was taken prisoner in the battle, and one of Antigonos, the
son of Demetrios; they are offerings, you may be sure, of the
Byzantines.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.8">

At the thirty-eighth Festival,[^393] Eutelidas the Spartan won two
victories among the boys, one for wrestling and one for the pentathlon,
this being the first and last occasion when boys were allowed to enter
for the pentathlon. The statue of Eutelidas is old, and the letters on
the pedestal are worn dim with age.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.9">

After Eutelidas is another statue of Areus the Lacedaemonian king, and
beside it is a statue of Gorgos the Eleian. Gorgos is the only man down
to my time who has won four victories at Olympia for the pentathlon,
beside a victory in the double race and a victory in the race in armor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.15.10">

The man with the boys standing beside him they say is Ptolemy, son of
Lagos.[^394] Beside him are two statues of the Eleian Kapros, the son of
Pythagoras, who received on the same day a garland for wrestling and a
garland for the pankration. This Kapros was the first man to win the two
victories. His victim overcome in the pankration I have already
mentioned;[^395] in wrestling, the man he overcame was the Eleian
Paeanios, who at the previous Festival had won a victory for wrestling,
while at the Pythian Games, he won a garland in the boys’ boxing match,
and again in the men’s wrestling match and in the men’s boxing match on
one and the same day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.1">

The victories of Kapros were not achieved without great toils and strong
effort. There are also at Olympia statues to Anauchidas and Pherenikos,
Eleians by lineage who won garlands for wrestling among the boys.
Pleistainos, the son of the Eurydamos who commanded the Aetolians
against the Gauls, had his statue dedicated by the Thespians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.2">

The statue of Antigonos the father of Demetrios and the statue of
Seleukos were dedicated by Tydeus the Eleian. The fame of Seleukos
became great among all men especially because of the capture of
Demetrios. Timon won victories for the pentathlon at all the Greek Games
except the Isthmian, at which he, like other Eleians, abstained from
competing. The inscription on his statue adds that he joined the
Aetolians in their expedition against the Thessalians and became leader
of the garrison at Naupaktos because of his friendship with the
Aetolians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.3">

Not far from the statue of Timon stands Hellas, and by Hellas stands
Elis; Hellas is garlanding with one hand Antigonos, the guardian of
Philip, the son of Demetrios, with the other, Philip himself; Elis is
garlanding Demetrios, who marched against Seleukos, and Ptolemy, the son
of Lagos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.4">

Aristeides of Elis won at Olympia (so the inscription on his statue
declares) a victory in the race run in armor, at Pythō a victory in the
double race, and at Nemeā, in the race for boys in the horse course. The
length of the horse-course is twice that of the double course; the event
had been omitted from the Nemean and Isthmian Games but was restored to
the Argives for their winter Nemean Games by ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.5">

Quite close to the statue of Aristeides stands Menalkes of Elis,
proclaimed victor at Olympia in the pentathlon, along with Philonides
son of Zotes, who was a native of Chersonesus in Crete, and a courier of
Alexander the son of Philip. After him comes Brimias of Elis, victor in
the men’s boxing match, Leonidas from Naxos in the Aegean, a statue
dedicated by the Arcadians of Psophis, a statue of Asamon, victor in the
men’s boxing match, and a statue of Nikandros, who won two victories at
Olympia in the double course and six victories in foot-races of various
kinds at the Nemean Games.[^396] Asamon and Nikandros were Eleians, the
statue of the latter was made by Daippos, that of Asamon by the
Messenian Pyrilampes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.6">

Eualkidas of Elis won victories in the boys’ boxing match, Seleadas the
Lacedaemonian in the men’s wrestling-match. Here too is dedicated a
small chariot of the Laconian Polypeithes, and on the same slab
Kalliteles, the father of Polypeithes, a wrestler. Polypeithes was
victorious with his four-horse chariot, Kalliteles in wrestling.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.7">

There are private Eleians, Lampos the son of Arniskos and \[...\] of
Aristarkhos; these the Psophidians dedicated, either because they were
their public friends or because they had shown them some good will.
Between them stands Lysippos of Elis, who beat his competitors in the
boys’ wrestling match; his statue was made by Andreas of Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.8">

Demosthenes the Lacedaemonian won an Olympic victory in the men’s
foot-race, and he dedicated in the Altis a slab by the side of his
statue. The inscription declares that the distance from Olympia to
another slab at Lacedaemon is six hundred and sixty furlongs. Theodoros
gained a victory in the pentathlon; Pyttalos the son of Lampis won the
boys’ boxing match, and Neolaidas received a garland for the foot race
and the race in armor; all were, I may tell you, Eleians. About
Pyttaloss, it is further related that, when a dispute about boundaries
occurred between the Arcadians and the Eleians, he delivered judgment on
the matter. His statue is the work of Sthennis the Olynthian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.16.9">

Next is Ptolemy, mounted on a horse, and by his side is an Eleian
athlete, Paeanios, the son of Damatrios, who won at Olympia a victory in
wrestling besides two Pythian victories. There is also Klearetos of
Elis, who received a garland in the pentathlon, and a chariot of an
Athenian, Glaukon, the son of Eteokles. This Glaukon was proclaimed
victor in a chariot-race for full-grown horses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.1">

These are the most remarkable sights that meet a man who goes over the
Altis according to the instructions I have given. But if you will go to
the right from the Leonidaion to the great altar, you will come across
the following notable objects. There is Demokrates of Tenedos, who won
the men’s wrestling match, and Kriannios of Elis, who won a victory in
the race in armor. The statue of Demokrates was made by Dionysikles of
Miletus, that of Kriannios by Lysos of Macedonia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.2">

The statues of Herodotus of Klazomenai and of Philinos, son of
Hegepolis, of Kos, were dedicated by their respective cities. The people
of Klazomenai dedicated a statue of Herodotus because he was the first
person from Klazomenai to be proclaimed victor at Olympia, his victory
being in the boys’ foot race. The people of Kos dedicated a statue of
Philinos because of his great renown, for he won at Olympia five
victories in running, at Pythō four victories, at Nemeā four, and at the
Isthmus eleven.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.3">

The statue of Ptolemy, the son of Ptolemy Lagos, was dedicated by
Aristolaos, a Macedonian. There is also dedicated a statue of a
victorious boy boxer, Butas of Miletus, son of Polyneikes; a statue too
of Kallikrates of Magnesia on the Lethaios, who received two garlands
for victories in the race in armor. The statue of Kallikrates is the
work of Lysippos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.4">

Enation won a victory in the boys’ foot race, Alexibios in the
pentathlon. The native place of Alexibios was Heraia in Arcadia, and
Acestor made his statue. The inscription on the statue of Enation does
not state his native place, though it does state that he was of Arcadian
descent. Two Kolophonians, Hermesianax, son of Agoneus, and Eikasios,
son of Lykinos and the daughter of Hermesianax, both won the boys’
wrestling match. The statue of Hermesianax was dedicated by the
commonwealth of Kolophon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.5">

Near these are Eleians who beat the boys at boxing, Khoirilos, the work
of Sthennis of Olynthus, and Theotīmos, the work of Daitondas of Sikyon.
Theotīmos was a son of Moschion, who took part in the expedition of
Alexander, the son of Philip, against Dareios and the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\]. There are two
more from Elis, Arkhidamos, who was victorious with a four horse
chariot, and Eperastos, the son of Theogonos, victor in the race in
armor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.6">

That he was the soothsayer of the lineage of the Klutidai, Eperastos
declares at the end of the inscription:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Of the stock of the sacred-tongued Klutidai I boast to be,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Their soothsayer, the scion of the god-like Melampodidai.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

For Mantios was a son of Melampos, the son of Amythaon, and he had a
son, Oikles, while Klytios was a son of Alkmaion, the son of Amphiaraos,
the son of Oikles. Klytios was the son of Alkmaion by the daughter of
Phegeus, and he migrated to Elis because he shrank from living with his
mother’s brothers, knowing that they had compassed the murder of
Alkmaion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.7">

Mingled with the less illustrious offerings we may see the statues of
Alexinikos of Elis, the work of Kantharos of Sikyon, who won a victory
in the boys’ wrestling match, and of Gorgias of Leontinoi. This statue
was dedicated at Olympia by Eumolpos, as he himself says, the grandson
of Deikrates who married the sister of Gorgias.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.8">

This Gorgias[^397] was a son of Kharmantides and is said to have been
the first to revive the study of rhetoric, which had been altogether
neglected, in fact almost forgotten by mankind. They say that Gorgias
won great renown for his eloquence at the Olympic assembly, and also
when he accompanied Tisias on an embassy to Athens. Yet Tisias improved
the art of rhetoric; in particular, he wrote the most persuasive speech
of his time to support the claim of a Syracusan woman to a property.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.17.9">

However, Gorgias surpassed his fame in Athens; indeed Jason, the tyrant
of Thessaly, placed him before Polykrates, who was a shining light of
the Athenian school. Gorgias, they say, lived to be one hundred and five
years old. Leontinoi was once laid waste by the Syracusans, but in my
time was again inhabited.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.18.1">

There is also a bronze statue of Cratisthenes of Cyrene, and on the
chariot stand Victory and Cratisthenes himself. It is thus plain that
his victory was in the chariot race. The story goes that Cratisthenes
was the son of Mnaseas the runner, surnamed the Libyan by the Greeks.
His offerings at Olympia are the work of Pythagoras of Rhēgion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.18.2">

Here too I remember discovering the statue of Anaximenes, who wrote a
universal history of ancient Greece, including the exploits of Philip
the son of Amyntas and the subsequent deeds of Alexander. His honor at
Olympia was due to the people of Lampsacus. Anaximenes bequeathed to
posterity the following anecdotes about himself. Alexander, the son of
Philip, no meek and mild person but a most passionate monarch, he
circumvented by the following artifice.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.18.3">

The people of Lampsacus favored the cause of the king \[basileus\] of
the Persians \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\],
or were suspected of doing so, and Alexander, boiling over with rage
against them, threatened to treat them with utmost rigor. As their
wives, their children, and their country itself were in great danger,
they sent Anaximenes to intercede for them, because he was known to
Alexander himself and had been known to Philip before him. Anaximenes
approached, and when Alexander learned for what cause he had come, they
say that he swore by the gods of Greece, whom he named, that he would do
the opposite of what Anaximenes asked.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.18.4">

Then Anaximenes said,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“Grant me, O king, this favor. Enslave the women and children of the
people of Lampsacus, raze the whole city even to the ground, and burn
the sanctuaries of their gods.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Such were his words, and Alexander, finding no way to counter the trick,
and bound by the compulsion of his oath, unwillingly pardoned the people
of Lampsacus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.18.5">

Anaximenes is also known to have retaliated on a personal enemy in a
very clever but very ill-natured way. He had a natural aptitude for
rhetoric and for imitating the style of rhetoricians. Having a quarrel
with Theopompos, the son of Damasistratos, he wrote a treatise abusing
Athenians, Lacedaemonians and Thebans alike. He imitated the style of
Theopompos with perfect accuracy, inscribed his name upon the book and
sent it round to the cities. Though Anaximenes was the author of the
treatise, hatred of Theopompos grew throughout the length of Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.18.6">

Moreover, Anaximenes was the first to compose extemporary speeches,
though I cannot believe that he was the author of the epic on Alexander.
Sotades at the ninety-ninth Festival[^398] was victorious in the long
race and proclaimed a Cretan, as in fact he was. But at the next
Festival, he made himself an Ephesian, being bribed to do so by the
Ephesian people. For this act, he was banished by the Cretans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.18.7">

The first athletes to have their statues dedicated at Olympia were
Praxidamas of Aegina, victorious at boxing at the fifty-ninth
Festival,[^399] and Rexibios the Opuntian, a competitor at the
pankration of the sixty-first Festival.[^400] These statues stand near
the pillar of Oinomaos and are made of wood, Rexibios of figwood and the
Aeginetan of cypress, and his statue is less decayed than the other.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.1">

There is in the Altis to the north of the Hēraion a terrace of
conglomerate, and behind it stretches \[Mount\] Kronion. On this terrace
are the treasuries, just as at Delphi certain of the Greeks have made
treasuries for Apollo. There is at Olympia a treasury called the
treasury of the Sikyonians, dedicated by Myron, who was tyrant of
Sikyon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.2">

Myron built it to commemorate a victory in the chariot race at the
thirty-third Festival.[^401] In the treasury he made two chambers, one
Dorian and one in the Ionic style. I saw that they were made of bronze;
whether the bronze is Tartessian, as the Eleians declare, I do not know.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.3">

They say that Tartessus is a river in the land of the Iberians, running
down into the sea by two mouths and that between these two mouths lies a
city of the same name. The river, which is the largest in Iberia, and
tidal, those of a later day called Baetis, and there are some who think
that Tartessus was the ancient name of Carpia, a city of the Iberians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.4">

On the smaller of the chambers at Olympia are inscriptions, which inform
us that the weight of the bronze is five hundred talents and that the
dedicators were Myron and the Sikyonian people. In this chamber are kept
three discuss, being used for the contest of the pentathlon. There is
also a bronze-plated shield, adorned with paintings on the inner side,
and along with the shield are a helmet and greaves. An inscription on
the armor says that they were dedicated by the Myanians as first-fruits
to Zeus. Various conjectures have been made as to who these Myanians
were.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.5">

I happened to remember that Thucydides[^402] in his history mentions
various cities of the people of Lokris who live near Phokis, and among
them the Myonians. So the Myanians on the shield are in my opinion the
same folk as the Myonians on the mainland of Lokris. The letters on the
shield are a little distorted, a fault due to the antiquity of the
votive offering.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.6">

There are placed here other offerings worthy to be recorded, the sword
of Pelops with its hilt of gold, and the ivory horn of Amaltheia, an
offering of Miltiades, the son of Kimon, who was the first of his house
to rule in the Thracian Chersonesus. On the horn is an inscription in
old Attic characters:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“To Olympian Zeus was I dedicated by the men of Chersonesus

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

After they had taken the fortress of Aratos.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Their leader was Miltiades.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

There stands also a box-wood image of Apollo with its head plated with
gold. The inscription says that it was dedicated by the people of Lokris
who live near the Western Cape, and that the artist was Patrokles of
Kroton, the son of Catillus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.7">

Next to the treasury of the Sikyonians is the treasury of the
Carthaginians, the work of Pothaios, Antiphilus, and Megakles. In it are
votive offerings—a huge image of Zeus and three linen breast-plates,
dedicated by Gelo and the Syracusans after overcoming the Phoenicians in
either a naval or a land battle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.8">

The third of the treasuries, and the fourth as well, were dedicated by
the Epidamnians \[…\]. It shows the sky-vault
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polos</span>\] upheld by
Atlas, and also Hēraklēs and the apple tree of the Hesperides, with the
snake coiled round the apple tree. These too are of cedarwood, and are
works of Theokles, son of Hegylus. The inscription on the sky-vault
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polos</span>\] says that his
son helped him to make it. The Hesperides (they were removed by the
Eleians) were even in my time in the Hēraion; the treasury was made for
the Epidamnians by Pyrrhos and his sons, Lakrates and Hermon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.9">

The Sybarites too built a treasury adjoining that of the Byzantines.
Those who have studied the history of Italy and of the Italian cities
say that Lupiae, situated between Brundusium and Hydrus, has changed its
name, and was Sybaris in ancient times. The harbor is artificial, being
a work of ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.10">

Near the treasury of the Sybarites is the treasury of the Libyans of
Cyrene. In it stand statues of Roman emperors. Selinous in Sicily was
destroyed by the Carthaginians in a war, but before the disaster befell
them, the citizens made a treasury dedicated to Zeus of Olympia. There
stands in it an image of Dionysus with face, feet, and hands of ivory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.11">

In the treasury of the Metapontines, which adjoins that of the
Selinuntians, stands an Endymion; it too is of ivory except the drapery.
How it came about that the Metapontines were destroyed I do not know,
but today nothing is left of Metaponton but the theater and the circuit
of the walls.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.12">

The Megarians who are neighbors of Attica built a treasury and dedicated
in it offerings, small cedarwood figures inlaid with gold, representing
the fight of Hēraklēs with Akhelōos. The figures include Zeus,
Deianeira, Akhelōos, Hēraklēs, and Ares helping Akhelōos. There once
stood here an image of Athena, as being an ally of Hēraklēs, but it now
stands by the Hesperides in the Hēraion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.13">

On the pediment of the treasury is carved the war of the giants and the
gods, and above the pediment is dedicated a shield, the inscription
declaring that the Megarians dedicated the treasury from spoils taken
from the Corinthians. I think that the Megarians won this victory when
Phorbas, who held a life office, was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\]in Athens. At
this time, Athenian offices were not yet annual, nor had the Eleians
begun to record the Olympiads.

The Argives are said to have helped the Megarians in the engagement with
the Corinthians. The treasury at Olympia was made by the Megarians
years[^403] after the battle, but it is to be supposed that they had the
offerings from of old, seeing that they were made by the Lacedaemonian
Dontas, a pupil of Dipoinos and Skyllis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.19.15">

The last of the treasuries is right by the stadium, the inscription

Mount Kronion, as I have already said, extends parallel to the terrace
with the treasuries on it. On the summit of the mountain the Basilai, as
they are called, sacrifice to Kronos at the spring equinox, in the month
called Elaphios among the Eleians.

The story is that when the Arcadians had invaded the land of Elis, and
the Eleians were set in array against them, a woman came to the Eleian
generals, holding a baby to her breast, who said that she was the mother
of the child but that she gave him, because of dreams, to fight for the
Eleians. The Eleian officers believed that the woman was to be trusted,
and placed the child before the army naked.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.5">

When the Arcadians attacked, the child turned at once into a snake
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakōn</span>\]. Thrown into
disorder at the sight, the Arcadians turned and fled, and were attacked
by the Eleians, who won a very famous victory, and so call the god
Sosipolis \[‘savior of the polis’\]. On the spot where after the battle
the snake \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drakōn</span>\]
seemed to them to go into the ground, they made the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\]. Along with
him, the Eleians established the custom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] of
worshipping \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sebesthai</span>\]
Eileithuia also, because this goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] produced her
son for humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.6">

The tomb of the Arcadians who were killed in the battle is on the hill
across the Kladeos to the west. Near to the sanctuary of Eileithuia are
the remains of the sanctuary of Aphrodite, the celestial one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ourania</span>\], and there
too they sacrifice upon the altars.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.7">

There is within the Altis by the processional entrance the Hippodameion,
as it is called, about a quarter of an acre of ground surrounded by a
wall. Into it once every year the women may enter, who sacrifice to
Hippodameia, and do her honor in other ways. The story is that
Hippodameia withdrew to Midea in Argolis, because Pelops was very angry
with her over the death of Khrysippos. The Eleians declare that
subsequently, because of an oracle, they brought the bones of
Hippodameia to Olympia.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.8">

At the end of the statues which they made from the fines levied on
athletes, there is the entrance called the Hidden Entrance. Through it,
umpires and competitors are accustomed to enter the stadium. Now the
stadium is an embankment of earth, and on it is a seat for the
presidents of the Games. Opposite the umpires is an altar of white
marble;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.9">

seated on this altar, a woman looks on at the Olympic Games, the
priestess of Demeter, Khamyne, which office the Eleians bestow from time
to time on different women. Girls are not debarred from looking on at
the Games. At the end of the stadium, where is the starting-place for
the runners, there is, the Eleians say, the tomb of Endymion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.10">

When you have passed beyond the stadium, at the point where the umpires
sit, is a place set apart for the horse races, and also the starting
place for the horses. The starting place is in the shape of the prow of
a ship, and its prow is turned towards the course. At the point where
the prow adjoins the porch of Agnaptos it broadens and a bronze dolphin
on a rod has been made at the very point of the ram.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.11">

Each side of the starting-place is more than four hundred feet in
length, and in the sides are built stalls. These stalls are assigned by
lot to those who enter for the races. Before the chariots or race-horses
is stretched a cord as a barrier. An altar of unburned brick, plastered
on the outside, is made at every Festival as near as possible to the
center of the prow,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.12">

and a bronze eagle stands on the altar with his wings stretched out to
the fullest extent. The man appointed to start the racing sets in motion
the mechanism in the altar, and then the eagle has been made to jump
upwards, so as to become visible to the spectators, while the dolphin
falls to the ground.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.13">

First, on either side the barriers are withdrawn by the porch of
Agnaptos, and the horses standing thereby run off first. As they run
they reach those to whom the second station has been allotted, and then
are withdrawn the barriers at the second station. The same thing happens
to all the horses in turn, until at the ram of the prow, they are all
abreast. After this, it is left to the charioteers to display their
skill and the horses, their speed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.14">

It was Kleoitas who originally devised the method of starting, and he
appears to have been proud of the discovery, as on the statue in Athens
he wrote the inscription:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Who first invented the method of starting the horses at Olympia,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

He made me, Kleoitas the son of Aristokles.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

It is said that after Kleoitas some further device was added to the
mechanism by Aristeides.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.15">

The race course has one side longer than the other, and on the longer
side, which is a bank, there stands, at the passage through the bank,
Taraxippos, the terror of the horses. It has the shape of a round altar,
and as they run along, the horses are seized, as soon as they reach this
point, by a great fear without any apparent reason. The fear leads to
disorder; the chariots generally crash and the charioteers are injured.
Consequently, the charioteers offer sacrifice, and pray that Taraxippos
may show himself propitious to them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.16">

The Greeks differ in their view of Taraxippos. Some hold that it is the
tomb of an original inhabitant who was skilled in horsemanship; they
call him Olenios, and say that after him was named the Olenian rock in
the land of Elis. Others say that Dameon, son of Phleious, who took part
in the expedition of Hēraklēs against Augeias and the Eleians, was
killed along with his charger by Kteatos, the son of Aktor, and that man
and horse were buried in the same tomb.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.17">

There is also a story that Pelops made here an empty mound in honor of
Myrtilos and sacrificed to him in an effort to calm the anger of the
murdered man, naming the mound[^405] Taraxippos (Frightener of horses)
because the mares of Oinomaos were frightened by the trick of Myrtilos.
Some say that it is Oinomaos himself who harms the racers in the course.
I have also heard some attach the blame to Alkathos, the son of
Porthaon. Killed by Oinomaos because he wooed Hippodameia, Alkathos,
they say, here got his portion of earth; having been unsuccessful on the
course, he is a spiteful and hostile deity to chariot drivers.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.18">

A man of Egypt said that Pelops received something from Amphion the
Theban and buried it in a place that they call Taraxippos, adding that
it was the buried thing which frightened the mares of Oinomaos, as well
as those of every charioteer since. This Egyptian thought that Amphion
and the Thracian Orpheus were clever magicians, and that it was through
their enchantments that the beasts came to Orpheus, and the stones came
to Amphion for the building of the wall. The most probable of the
stories in my opinion makes Taraxippos a surname of Horse Poseidon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.20.19">

There is another Taraxippos at the Isthmus, namely Glaukos, the son of
Sisyphus. They say that he was killed by his horses, when Akastos held
his contests in honor of his father. At Nemeā of the Argives there was
no hero who harmed the horses, but above the turning-point of the
chariots rose a rock, red in color, and the flash from it terrified the
horses, just as though it had been fire. But the Taraxippos at Olympia
is much worse for terrifying the horses. On one turning-post is a bronze
statue of Hippodameia carrying a ribbon, and about to garland Pelops
with it for his victory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.1">

The other side of the course is not a bank of earth but a low hill. At
the foot of the hill has been built a sanctuary to Demeter surnamed
Khamyne. Some are of opinion that the name is old, signifying that here
the earth gaped[^406] for the chariot of Hades and then closed up[^407]
once more. Others say that Khamynos was a man of Pisa who opposed
Pantaleon, the son of Omphalion and despot at Pisa, when he plotted to
revolt from Elis; Pantaleon, they say, put him to death, and from his
property was built the sanctuary to Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.2">

In place of the old images of the Maiden and of Demeter, new ones of
Pentelic marble were dedicated by Herodes the Athenian. In the gymnasium
at Olympia, it is customary for pentathletes and runners to practice,
and in the open has been made a basement of stone. Originally, there
stood on the basement a trophy to commemorate a victory over the
Arcadians. There is also another enclosure, less than this, to the left
of the entrance to the gymnasium, and the athletes have their wrestling
schools here. Adjoining the wall of the eastern porch of the gymnasium
are the dwellings of the athletes, turned towards the southwest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.3">

On the other side of the Kladeos is the tomb of Oinomaos, a mound of
earth with a stone wall built round it, and above the tomb are ruins of
buildings in which Oinomaos is said to have stabled his mares. The
boundaries which now separate Arcadia and Elis originally separated
Arcadia from Pisa, and are thus situated. On crossing the river
Erymanthos at what is called the ridge of Saurus are the tomb of Saurus
and a sanctuary of Hēraklēs, now in ruins. The story is that Saurus used
to do mischief to travelers and to dwellers in the neighborhood until he
received his punishment at the hands of Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.4">

At this ridge which has the same name as the robber, a river, falling
into the Alpheios from the south, just opposite the Erymanthos, is the
boundary between the land of Pisa and Arcadia; it is called the Diagon.
Forty stadium-lengths beyond the ridge of Saurus is a temple of
Asklepios, surnamed Demainetos after the founder. It too is in ruins. It
was built on the height beside the Alpheios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.5">

Not far from it is a sanctuary of Dionysus Leucyanites, whereby flows a
river Leucyanias. This river too is a tributary of the Alpheios; it
descends from Mount Pholoe. Crossing the Alpheios after it, you will be
within the land of Pisa.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.6">

In this region there is an elevation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">lophos</span>\] culminating in
a sharp peak, and on top of that elevation are the ruins of an acropolis
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] called Phrixa
and a temple \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of
Athena, whose name-of-invocation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\] is
*Kudōníā*. This temple is not completely preserved, but it still has an
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\], even in
my time. And the people say that this sacred-space
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] was founded in
honor of the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theós</span> (feminine)\] by
Klymenos, descendant of Hēraklēs, the-one-from-Mount-Ida
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Idaios</span>\], and that he
\[Klymenos\] came on the scene from the city of *Kudōníā*-in-Crete and
from the river Iardanos. And the people of Elis say that Pelops
sacrificed \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] to
Athena *Kudōníā* before he entered the contest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agōn</span>\] \[of a
race-to-the-death in chariots\] with Oinomaos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.7">

Going on from this point, you come to the water of Parthenia, and by the
river is the tomb of the mares of Marmax. The story has it that this
Marmax was the first suitor of Hippodameia to arrive, and that he was
killed by Oinomaos before the others; that the names of his mares were
Parthenia and Eripha; that Oinomaos slew the mares after Marmax, but
granted burial to them also, and that the river received the name
Parthenia from the mare of Marmax.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.8">

There is another river called Harpinates, and not far from the river
are, among the other ruins of a city Harpina, its altars. The city was
founded, they say, by Oinomaos, who named it after his mother Harpina.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.9">

A little farther on is a high mound of earth, the tomb of the suitors of
Hippodameia. Now Oinomaos, they say, laid them in the ground near one
another with no token of respect. But afterwards, Pelops raised a high
monument to them all, to honor them and to please Hippodameia. I think
too that Pelops wanted a memorial to tell posterity the number and
character of the men vanquished by Oinomaos before Pelops himself
conquered him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.10">

According to the epic poem called the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Great Eoeae,</span> the next after
Marmax to be killed by Oinomaos was Alkathos, son of Porthaon; after
Alkathos came Euryalos, Eurymakhos, and Krotalos. Now the parents and
fatherlands of these I was unable to discover, but Akrias, the next
after them to be killed, one might guess to have been a Lacedaemonian
and the founder of Akriai. After Akrias, they say that Oinomaos slew
Kapetos, Lycurgus (Lykourgos), Lasios, Khalkodon, and Trikolonos, who,
according to the Arcadians, was the descendant and namesake of
Trikolonos, the son of Lykaon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.21.11">

After Trikolonos the next to meet their fate in the race were
Aristomakhos and Prias, and then Pelagon, Aiolios, and Kronios. Some add
to the the previously mentioned names Erythras, the son of Leukon, the
son of Athamas, after whom was named Erythrai in Boeotia, and Eioneus,
the son of Magnes, the son of Aiolos. These are the men whose monument
is here, and Pelops, they say, sacrificed every year to them as heroes,
when he had won the sovereignty of Pisa.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.1">

As one proceeds about a stadium-length from the tomb,there are traces of
a sanctuary of Artemis surnamed Kordakā— because the followers of Pelops
celebrated \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] a
victory-feast
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-nīkia</span>\] at the
place of the goddess and danced
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">orkhēsasthai</span>\] a local

small building \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma</span>\]

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kibōtos</span>\], and the the
bones of Pelops are kept in this chest

stood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.2">

The founder of the city, they say, was Pisos, the son of Perieres, the
son of Aeolus. The people of Pisa brought of themselves disaster on
their own heads by their hostility to the people of Elis, and by their
keenness to preside over the Olympic Games instead of them. At the
eighth Festival[^408] they brought in Pheidon of Argos, the most
overbearing of the Greek tyrants, and held the Games along with him,
while at the thirty-fourth Festival[^409] the people of Pisa, with their
king Pantaleon, the son of Omphalion, collected an army from the
neighborhood, and held the Olympic Games instead of the Eleians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.3">

These Festivals, as well as the hundred and fourth,[^410] which was held
by the Arcadians, are called “Non-Olympiads” by the Eleians, who do not
include them in a list of Olympiads. At the forty-eighth Festival,[^411]
Damophon, the son of Pantaleon, gave the Eleians reasons for suspecting
that he was intriguing against them, but when they invaded the land of
Pisa with an army, he persuaded them by prayers and oaths to return
quietly home again.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.4">

When Pyrrhos, the son of Pantaleon, succeeded his brother Damophon as
king, the people of Pisa of their own accord made war against Elis and
were joined in their revolt from the Eleians by the people of Makistos
and Skillos, which are in Triphylia, and by the people of Dyspontium,
another vassal community. The list were closely related to the people of
Pisa, and it was a tradition of theirs that their founder had been
Dysponteus, the son of Oinomaos. It was the fate of Pisa, and of all her
allies, to be destroyed by the Eleians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.5">

Of Pylos in the land of Elis the ruins are to be seen on the mountain
road from Olympia to Elis, the distance between Elis and Pylos being
eighty stadium-lengths. This Pylos was founded, as I have already
said,[^412] by a Megarian called Pylon, the son of Kleson. Destroyed by
Hēraklēs and refounded by the Eleians, the city was doomed in time to be
without inhabitants. Beside it, the river Ladon flows into the Peneios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.6">

The Eleians declare that there is a reference to this Pylos in the
passage of Homer:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“And he was descended from the river

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Alpheios, that in broad stream flows through the land of the Pylians.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> V 544

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

The Eleians convinced me that they are right. For the Alpheios does flow
through this district, and the passage cannot refer to another Pylos.
For the land of the Pylians over against the island Sphakteria simply
cannot in the nature of things be crossed by the Alpheios, and,
moreover, we know of no city in Arcadia named Pylos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.7">

Distant from Olympia about fifty stadium-lengths is Herakleia, a village
of the Eleians, and beside it is a river Cytherus. A spring flows into
the river, and there is a sanctuary of nymphs near the spring.
Individually, the names of the nymphs are Kalliphaiïa, Synallasis,
Pegaia, and Iasis, but their common surname is the Ionides. Those who
bathe in the spring are cured of all sorts of aches and pains. They say
that the nymphs are named after Ion, the son of Gargettos, who migrated
to this place from Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.8">

If you wish to go to Elis through the plain, you will travel one hundred
and twenty stadium-lengths to Letrini, and one hundred and eighty from
Letrini to Elis. Originally, Letrini was a town, and Letreus, the son of
Pelops, was its founder; but in my time were left a few buildings, with
an image of Artemis Alpheiaea in a temple.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.9">

It is said that the goddess received the surname for the following
reason. Alpheios fell in love with Artemis, and then, realizing that
persuasive entreaties would not win the goddess as his bride, he dared
to plot violence against her. Artemis was holding at Letrini an
all-night revel with the nymphs who were her playmates, and to it came
Alpheios. But Artemis had a suspicion of the plot of Alpheios, and
smeared with mud her own face and the faces of the nymphs with her. So
Alpheios, when he joined the throng, could not distinguish Artemis from
the others, and, not being able to pick her out, went away without
bringing off his attempt.

The people of Letrini called the goddess Alpheian because of the love of
Alpheios for her. But the Eleians, who from the first had been friends
of Letrini, transferred to that city the worship of Artemis Elaphiaea
established amongst themselves, and held that they were worshipping
Artemis Alpheiaea, and so in time, the Alpheiaean goddess came to be
named Elaphiaea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.22.11">

The Eleians, I think, called Artemis Elaphiaea from the hunting of the
deer (elaphos). But they themselves say that Elaphios was the name of a
native woman by whom Artemis was reared. About six stadium-lengths
distant from Letrini is a lake that never dries up, being just about
three stadium-lengths across.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.1">

One of the noteworthy things in Elis is an old gymnasium. In this
gymnasium, the athletes are accustomed to go through the training
through which they must pass before going to Olympia. High plane trees
grow between the tracks inside a wall. The whole of this enclosure is
called Xystos, because an exercise of Hēraklēs, the son of Amphitryo,
was to scrape up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anaxuein</span>\] each day all
the thistles that grew there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.2">

The track for the competing runners, called by the natives the Sacred
Track, is separate from that on which the runners and pentathletes
practice. In the gymnasium is the place called Plethrium. In it, the
umpires match the competitors according to age and skill; it is for
wrestling that they match them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.3">

There are also in the gymnasium altars
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmoi</span>\] of gods: of
Hēraklēs of \[Mount\] Ida, who has the epithet
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\] Parastatēs
(‘defender’), also of Eros, of the deity called Ant-Eros (‘love
returned’) by the people of Elis and Athens alike, of Demeter and of her
daughter. Achilles has no altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\], but he does
have a tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\]
that is empty \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kenon</span> =
having no body in it\], in accordance with an oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteiā</span>\]. When the
festival \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">panēguris</span>\]
\[of the Olympics\] begins, on an appointed day, at the time when the
sun, in the course-of-its-\[daily\]-run
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dromos</span>\], is sinking
toward the west, the women of Elis have-the-custom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] of
doing-ritual \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\], in
various ways, for the purpose of giving honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmē</span>\] to Achilles,
especially by way of bewailing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">koptesthai</span>\] him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.4">

There is another enclosed gymnasium, but smaller, adjoining the larger
one and called Square because of its shape. Here the athletes practice
wrestling, and here, when they have no more wrestling to do, they are
matched in contests with the softer gloves. There is also dedicated here
one of the images made in honor of Zeus out of the fines imposed upon
Sosandros of Smyrna and upon Polyktor of Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.5">

There is also a third enclosed gymnasium, called Maltho from the
softness of its floor, and reserved for the youths for the whole time of
the festival. In a corner of the Maltho is a bust of Hēraklēs as far as
the shoulders, and in one of the wrestling-schools is a relief showing
Love and Love Returned, as he is called. Love holds a palm-branch, and
Love Returned is trying to take the palm from him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.6">

On each side of the entrance to the Maltho stands an image of a boy
boxer. He was by birth, so the Guardian of the Laws at Elis told me,
from Alexandria over against the island Pharos, and his name was
Sarapion; arriving at Elis when the townsfolk were suffering from
famine, he supplied them with food. For this reason, these honors were
paid him here. The time of his garland at Olympia and of his benefaction
to the Eleians was the two hundred and seventeenth Festival.[^413]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.7">

In this gymnasium is also the Eleian Council House, where exhibitions of
extempore speeches and recitations of written works of all kinds take
place. It is called Lalichmium, after the man who dedicated it. About it
are dedicated shields, which are for show and not made to be used in
war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.23.8">

The way from the gymnasium to the baths passes through the Street of
Silence and beside the sanctuary of Artemis Philomeirax. The goddess is
so surnamed because she is neighbor to the gymnasium; the street
received, they say, the name of Silence for the following reason. Men of
the army of Oxylos were sent to spy out what was happening in Elis. On
the way, they exhorted each other, when they should be near the wall,
themselves to keep a strict silence, but to listen attentively if
perchance they might learn something from the people in the town. These
men by this street reached the town unobserved, and after hearing all
they wished, they went back again to the Aetolians. So the street
received its name from the silence of the spies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.1">

One of the two ways from the gymnasium leads to the marketplace and to
what is called the Umpires’ Room; it is above the tomb of Achilles, and
by it, the umpires are accustomed to go to the gymnasium. They enter
before sunrise to match the runners, and at midday for the pentathlon
and for such contests as are called heavy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.2">

The marketplace of Elis is not after the fashion of the cities of Ionia
and of the Greek cities near Ionia; it is built in the older manner,
with porticoes separated from each other and with streets through them.
The modern name of the marketplace is Hippodromos, and the natives train
their horses there. Of the porticoes the southern is in the Doric style,
and it is divided by the pillars into three parts. In it, the umpires
generally spend the day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.3">

At the pillars, they also cause altars to be made to Zeus, and in the
open marketplace are the altars, in number not many; for, their
construction being improvised, they are without difficulty taken to
pieces. As you enter the marketplace at this portico, the Umpires’ Room
is on your left, parallel to the end of the portico. What separates it
from the marketplace is a street. In this Umpires’ Room dwell for ten
consecutive months the umpires elect, who are instructed by the
Guardians of the Law as to their duties at the festival.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.4">

Near to the portico where the umpires pass the day is another portico,
between the two being one street. The Eleians call it the Corcyrean,
because, they say, the Corcyreans landed in their country and carried
off part of the plunder, but they themselves took many times as much
loot from the land of the Corcyreans and built the portico from the
tithe of the spoils.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.5">

The portico is in the Doric style and double, having its pillars both on
the side towards the marketplace and on the side away from it. Down the
center of it the roof is supported, not by pillars, but by a wall,
beside which on either side have been dedicated statues. On the side of
the portico towards the marketplace stands a statue of Pyrrhon, son of
Pistokrates, a sophist who never brought himself to make a definite
admission on any matter. The tomb also of Pyrrhon is not far from the
town of the Eleians. The name of the place is Petra, and it is said that
Petra was a township in ancient times.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.6">

The most notable things that the Eleians have in the open part of the
marketplace are a temple and image of Apollo Healer. The meaning of the
name would appear to be exactly the same as that of Averter of Evil, the
name current among the Athenians. In another part are the stone images
of the sun and of the moon; from the head of the moon project horns,
from the head of the sun, his rays. There is also a sanctuary to the
Graces; the images are of wood, with their clothes gilded, while their
faces, hands and feet are of white marble. One of them holds a rose, the
middle one a die, and the third a small spray of myrtle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.7">

The reason for their holding these things may be guessed to be this. The
rose and the myrtle are sacred to Aphrodite and connected with the story
of Adonis, while the Graces are of all deities the nearest related to
Aphrodite. As for the die, it is the plaything of youths and maidens,
who have nothing of the ugliness of old age. On the right of the Graces
is an image of Love, standing on the same pedestal.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.8">

Here is also a temple of Silenus, which is sacred to Silenus alone, and
not to him in common with Dionysus. Drunkenness is offering him wine in
a cup. That the Silenuses are humans you may infer especially from their
tombs, for there is a tomb of a Silenus in the land of the Hebrews, and
of another at Pergamon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.9">

In the marketplace of Elis, I saw something else, a low structure in the
form of a temple. It has no walls, the roof being supported by pillars
made of oak. The natives agree that it is a tomb, but they do not
remember whose it is. If the old man I asked spoke the truth, it would
be the tomb of Oxylos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.24.10">

There is also in the marketplace a building for the women called the
Sixteen, where they weave the robe for Hērā. Adjoining the marketplace
is an old temple surrounded by pillars; the roof has fallen down, and I
found no image in the temple. It is dedicated to the Roman emperors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.25.1">

Behind the portico built from the spoils of Corcyra is a temple of
Aphrodite, the precinct being in the open, not far from the temple. The
goddess in the temple they call the celestial one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ourania</span>\]; she is of
ivory and gold, the work of Pheidias, and she stands with one foot upon
a tortoise. The precinct of the other Aphrodite is surrounded by a wall,
and within the precinct has been made a basement, upon which sits a
bronze image of Aphrodite upon a bronze he-goat. It is a work of Scopas,
and the Aphrodite is named Common. The meaning of the tortoise and of
the he-goat I leave to those who care to guess.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.25.2">

The sacred enclosure of Hades and its temple (for the Eleians have these
among their possessions) are opened once every year, but not even on
this occasion is anybody permitted to enter except the priest. The
following is the reason why the Eleians worship Hades; they are the only
men we know of who do so. It is said that, when Hēraklēs was leading an
expedition against Pylos in Elis, Athena was one of his allies. Now
among those who came to fight on the side of the Pylians was Hades, who
was the foe of Hēraklēs but was worshipped at Pylos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.25.3">

Homer is quoted in support of the story, who says in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“And among them huge Hades suffered a wound from a swift arrow,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When the same man, the son of
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aegis</span>-bearing Zeus,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> V 395–397

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

If in the expedition of Agamemnon and Menelaos against Troy, Poseidon
was according to Homer an ally of the Greeks, it cannot be unnatural for
the same poet to hold that Hades helped the Pylians. At any rate, it was
in the belief that the god was their friend but the enemy of Hēraklēs
that the Eleians made the sanctuary for him. The reason why they are
accustomed to open it only once each year is, I suppose, because men too
go down only once to Hades.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.25.4">

The Eleians have also a sanctuary of Fortune. In a portico of the
sanctuary has been dedicated a colossal image, made of gilded wood
except the face, hands, and feet, which are of white marble. Here
Sosipolis too is worshipped in a small shrine on the left of the
sanctuary of Fortune. The god is painted according to his appearance in
a dream: in age, a boy, wrapped in a star-spangled robe, and in one hand
holding the horn of Amaltheia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.25.5">

In the most thickly populated part of Elis is a statue of bronze no
taller than a tall man; it represents a beardless youth with his legs
crossed, leaning with both hands upon a spear. They cast about it a
garment of wool, one of flax and one of fine linen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.25.6">

This image was said to be of Poseidon, and to have been worshipped in
ancient times at Samikon in Triphylia. Transferred to Elis, it received
still greater honor, but the Eleians call it Satrap and not Poseidon,
having learned the name Satrap, which is a surname of Corybas, after the
enlargement of Patrai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.26.1">

Between the marketplace and the Menios is an old theater and a shrine of
Dionysus. The image is the work of Praxiteles. Of the gods, the Eleians
worship Dionysus with the greatest reverence, and they assert that the
god attends their festival, the Thyia. The place where they hold the
festival, they name the Thyia is about eight stadium-lengths from the
city. Three pots are brought into the building by the priests and set
down empty in the presence of the citizens and of any strangers who may
chance to be in the country. The doors of the building are sealed by the
priests themselves and by any others who may be so inclined.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.26.2">

On the morrow they are allowed to examine the seals, and on going into
the building, they find the pots filled with wine. I did not myself
arrive at the time of the festival, but the most respected Eleian
citizens, and with them strangers also, swore that what I have said is
the truth. The Andrians too assert that every other year at their feast
of Dionysus, wine flows of its own accord from the sanctuary. If the
Greeks are to be believed in these matters, one might with equal reason
accept what the Ethiopians above Syene say about the table of the
sun.[^414]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.26.3">

On the Acropolis of the Eleians is a sanctuary of Athena. The image is
of ivory and gold. They say that the goddess is the work of Pheidias. On
her helmet is an image of a rooster, this bird being very ready to
fight. The bird might also be considered as sacred to Athena the worker.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.26.4">

Cyllene is one hundred and twenty stadium-lengths distant from Elis; it
faces Sicily and affords ships a suitable anchorage. It is the port of
Elis, and received its name from a man of Arcadia. Homer does not
mention Cyllene in the list of the Eleians, but in a later part of the
poem, he has shown that Cyllene was one of the towns he knew.

The land of Elis is fruitful, being especially suited to the growth of
fine flax. Now while hemp and flax, both the ordinary and the fine
variety, are sown by those whose soil is suited to grow it, the threads
from which the Seres make the dresses are produced from no bark, but in
a different way as follows. There is in the land of the Seres an insect
which the Greeks call
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ser</span>, though the Seres
themselves give it another name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.26.7">

Its size is twice that of the largest beetle, but in other respects, it
is like the spiders that spin under trees, and furthermore it has, like
the spider, eight feet. These creatures are reared by the Seres, who
build them houses adapted for winter and for summer. The product of the
creatures, a clue of fine thread, is found rolled round their feet.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.26.8">

They keep them for four years, feeding them on millet, but in the fifth
year, knowing that they have no longer to live, they give them green
reed to eat. This of all foods the creature likes best; so it stuffs
itself with the reed till it bursts with surfeit, and after it has thus
died they find inside it the greater part of the thread. Seria is known
to be an island lying in a recess of the Red Sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:6.26.9">

But I have heard that it is not the Red Sea, but a river called Ser,
that makes this island, just as in Egypt, the Delta is surrounded by the
Nile and by no sea. Such another island is Seria said to be. These Seres
themselves are of Ethiopian lineage, as are the inhabitants of the
neighboring islands, Abasa and Sacaea. Some say, however, that they are
not Ethiopians but a mixed lineage of Scythians and Indians.

Such are the accounts that are given. As you go from Elis to Achaea, you
come after one hundred and fifty-seven stadium-lengths to the river
Larisos, and in modern days, this river forms the boundary between Elis
and Achaea, though of old the boundary was Cape Araxos on the coast.

</div>

## Scroll VII. Achaea

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.1">

The land between Elis and Sikyonia, reaching down to the eastern sea, is
now called Achaea after the inhabitants, but of old was called Aigialeus
and those who lived in it Aegialians. According to the Sikyonians the
name is derived from Aigialeus, who was king in what is now Sikyonia;
others say that it is from the land, the greater part of which is coast
(<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aigialos</span>).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.2">

Later on, after the death of Hellen, Xuthus was expelled from Thessaly
by the rest of the sons of Hellen, who charged him with having
appropriated some of the ancestral property. But he fled to Athens,
where he was deemed worthy to wed the daughter of Erekhtheus, by whom he
had sons, Achaios and Ion. On the death of Erekhtheus Xuthus was
appointed judge to decide which of his sons should succeed him. He
decided that Kekrops, the eldest of them, should be king, and was
accordingly banished from the land by the rest of the sons of
Erekhtheus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.3">

He reached Aigialos, made his home there, and there died. Of his sons,
Achaios with the assistance of allies from Aigialos and Athens returned
to Thessaly and recovered the throne of his fathers: Ion, while
gathering an army against the people of Aigialos and Selinous their
king, received a message from Selinous, who offered to give him in
marriage Helike, his only child, as well as to adopt him as his son and
successor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.4">

It so happened that the proposal found favor with Ion, and on the death
of Selinous he became king of the people of Aigialos. He called the city
he founded in Aigialos Helike after his wife, and called the inhabitants
Ionians after himself. This, however, was not a change of name, but an
addition to it, for the people were named ‘Ionians of Aigialos’. The
original name clung to the land even longer than to the people; for at
any rate in the list of the allies of Agamemnon, Homer[^415] Is content
to mention the ancient name of the land:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Throughout all Aigialos and about wide Helike.”

At that time in the reign of Ion the Eleusinians made war on the
Athenians, and these having invited Ion to be their leader in the war,
he met his death in Attica, his tomb being in the deme of Potamus. The
descendants of Ion became rulers of the Ionians, until they themselves
as well as the people were expelled by the Achaeans. The Achaeans at
that time had themselves been expelled from Lacedaemon and Argos by the
Dorians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.6">

The history of the Ionians in relation to the Achaeans I will give as
soon as I have explained the reason why the inhabitants of Lacedaemon
and Argos were the only Peloponnesians to be called Achaeans before the
return of the Dorians. Arkhandros and Arkhiteles, sons of Achaios, came
from Phthiōtis to Argos, and after their arrival became sons-in-law of
Danaos, Arkhiteles marrying Automate and Arkhandros Scaea. A very clear
proof that they settled in Argos is the fact that Arkhandros named his
son Metanastes (Settler).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.7">

When the sons of Achaios came to power in Argos and Lacedaemon, the
inhabitants of these towns came to be called Achaeans. The name Achaeans
was common to them; the Argives had the special name of Danai. On the
occasion referred to, being expelled by the Dorians from Argos and
Lacedaemon, the Achaeans themselves and their king Tisamenus, the son of
Orestes, sent heralds to the Ionians, offering to settle among them
without warfare. But the kings of the Ionians were afraid that, if the
Achaeans united with them, Tisamenus would be chosen king of the
combined people because of his manliness and noble lineage.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.8">

The Ionians rejected the proposal of the Achaeans and came out to fight
them; in the battle Tisamenus was killed, the Ionians were overcome by
the Achaeans, fled to Helike, where they were besieged, and afterwards
were allowed to depart under a truce. The body of Tisamenus was buried
in Helike by the Achaeans, but afterwards at the command of the Delphic
oracle the Lacedaemonians carried his bones to Sparta, and in my own day
his tomb still existed in the place where the Lacedaemonians take the
dinner called Pheiditia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.1.9">

The Ionians went to Attica, and they were allowed to settle there by the
Athenians and their king Melanthos, the son of Andropompus, I suppose
for the sake of Ion and his achievements when he was commander-in-chief
of the Athenians. Another account is that the Athenians suspected that
the Dorians would not keep their hands off them, and received the
Ionians to strengthen themselves rather than for any goodwill they felt
towards the Ionians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.1">

A few years afterwards Medon and Neileus, the oldest of the sons of
Kodros, quarrelled about the rule, and Neileus refused to allow Medon to
rule over him, because he was lame in one foot. The disputants agreed to
refer the matter to the Delphic oracle, and the Pythian priestess gave
the kingdom of Athens to Medon. So Neileus and the rest of the sons of
Kodros set out to found a colony, taking with them any Athenian who
wished to go with them, but the greatest number of their company was
composed of Ionians.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.2">

This was the third expedition sent out from Greece under kings of a
lineage different from that of the common folk. The earliest was when
Iolaos of Thebes, the nephew of Hēraklēs, led the Athenians and
Thespians to Sardinia. One generation before the Ionians set sail from
Athens, the Lacedaemonians and Minyans who had been expelled from Lemnos
by the Pelasgians were led by the Theban Theras, the son of Autesion, to
the island now called after him, but formerly named Kalliste.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.3">

The third occasion was the expedition to which I have referred, when the
sons of Kodros were appointed leaders of the Ionians, although they were
not related to them, but were, through Kodros and Melanthos, Messenians
of Pylos, and, on their mother’s side, Athenians. Those who shared in
the expedition of the Ionians were the following among the Greeks: some
Thebans under Philotas, a descendant of Peneleus; Minyans of Orkhomenos,
because they were related to the sons of Kodros.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.4">

There also took part all the people of Phokis except the Delphians, and
with them Abantes from Euboea. Ships for the voyage were given to the
men of Phokis by Philogenes and Damon, Athenians and sons of Euctemon,
who themselves led the colony. When they landed in Asia they divided,
the different parties attacking the different cities on the coast, and
Neileus with his party made for Miletus.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.5">

The Milesians themselves give the following account of their earliest
history. For two generations, they say, their land was called Anaktoria,
during the reigns of Anax, an aboriginal, and of Asterios his son; but
when Miletus landed with an army of Cretans both the land and the city
changed their name to Miletus. Miletus and his men came from Crete,
fleeing from Minos, the son of Europa; the Carians, the former
inhabitants of the land, united with the Cretans. But to resume.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.6">

When the Ionians had overcome the ancient Milesians they killed every
male, except those who escaped at the capture of the city, but the wives
of the Milesians and their daughters they married.

The tomb of Neileus is on the left of the road, not far from the gate,
as you go to Didymi. The sanctuary of Apollo at Didymi, and his oracle,
are earlier than the immigration of the Ionians, while the cult of
Ephesian Artemis is far more ancient still than their coming.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.7">

Pindar, however, it seems to me, did not learn everything about the
goddess, for he says that this sanctuary was founded by the Amazons
during their campaign against Athens and Theseus.[^416] It is a fact
that the women from the Thermodon, as they knew the sanctuary from of
old, sacrificed to the Ephesian goddess both on this occasion and when
they had fled from Hēraklēs; some of them earlier still, when they had
fled from Dionysus, having come to the sanctuary as suppliants. However,
it was not by the Amazons that the sanctuary was founded, but by
Koresos, an aboriginal, and Ephesos, who is thought to have been a son
of the river Cayster, and from Ephesos the city received its name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.8">

The inhabitants of the land were partly Leleges, a branch of the
Carians, but the greater number were Lydians. In addition there were
others who dwelled around the sanctuary for the sake of its protection,
and these included some women originating from the lineage of the
Amazons. But Androklos the son of Kodros (for he it was who was
appointed king of the Ionians who sailed against Ephesos) expelled from
the land the Leleges and Lydians who occupied the upper city. Those,
however, who dwelled around the sanctuary had nothing to fear; they
exchanged oaths of friendship with the Ionians and escaped warfare.
Androklos also took Samos from the Samians, and for a time the Ephesians
held Samos and the adjacent islands.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.9">

But after that the Samians had returned to their own land, Androklos
helped the people of Priene against the Carians. The Greek army was
victorious, but Androklos was killed in the battle. The Ephesians
carried off his body and buried it in their own land, at the spot where
his tomb is pointed out at the present day, on the road leading from the
sanctuary past the Olympieum to the Magnesian gate. On the tomb is a
statue of an armed man.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.10">

The Ionians who settled at Myous and Priene, they too took the cities
from Carians. The founder of Myous was Kyaretos the son of Kodros, but
the people of Priene, half Theban and half Ionian, had as their founders
Philotas, the descendant of Peneleus, and Aipytos, the son of Neileus.
The people of Priene, although they suffered much at the hands of
Tabutes the Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persēs</span>\] and afterwards
at the hands of Hieron, a native, yet down to the present day are
accounted Ionians. The people of Myous left their city on account of the
following accident.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.2.11">

A small inlet of the sea used to run into their land. This inlet the
river Maeander turned into a lake, by blocking up the entrance with mud.
When the water, ceasing to be sea, became fresh,[^417] gnats in vast
swarms bred in the lake until the inhabitants were forced to leave the
city. They departed for Miletus, taking with them the images of the gods
and their other movables, and on my visit I found nothing in Myus except
a white marble temple of Dionysus. A similar fate to that of Myus
happened to the people of Atarneus, under Mount Pergamos.

The people of Kolophon suppose that the sanctuary at Klaros, and the
oracle, were founded in the remotest antiquity. They assert that while
the Carians still held the land, the first Greeks to arrive were Cretans
under Rhakios, who was followed by a great crowd also; these occupied
the shore and were strong in ships, but the greater part of the country
continued in the possession of the Carians. When Thebes was taken by
Thersandros, the son of Polyneikes, and the Argives, among the prisoners
brought to Apollo at Delphi was Manto. Her father Teiresias had died on
the way, in Haliartia,

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.3.2">

and when the god had sent them out to found a colony, they crossed in
ships to Asia, but as they came to Klaros, the Cretans came against them
armed and carried them away to Rhakios. But he, learning from Manto who
they were and why they were come, took Manto to wife, and allowed the
people with her to inhabit the land. Mopsos, the son of Rhakios and of
Manto, drove the Carians from the country altogether.

The Ionians swore an oath to the Greeks in Kolophon, and lived with them
in one city on equal terms, but the kingship was taken by the Ionian
leaders, Damasichthon and Promethus, sons of Kodros. Afterwards
Promethus killed his brother Damasichthon and fled to Naxos, where he
died, but his body was carried home and received by the sons of
Damasichthon. The name of the place where Damasichthon is buried is
called Polyteichides.

How it befell that Kolophon was laid waste I have already related in my
account of Lysimakhos.[^418] Of those who were transported to Ephesos
only the people of Kolophon fought against Lysimakhos and the
Macedonians. The tomb of those Kolophonians and Smyrnaeans who fell in
the battle is on the left of the road as you go to Klaros.

The city of Lebedos was razed to the ground by Lysimakhos, simply in
order that the population of Ephesos might be increased. The land around
Lebedos is a happy one; in particular its hot baths are more numerous
and more pleasant than any others on the coast. Originally Lebedos also
was inhabited by the Carians, until they were driven out by Andraemon
the son of Kodros and the Ionians. The tomb of Andraemon is on the left
of the road as you go from Kolophon, when you have crossed the river
Calaon.

Teos used to be inhabited by Minyans of Orkhomenos, who came to it with
Athamas. This Athamas is said to have been a descendant of Athamas the
son of Aeolus. Here too there was a Carian element combined with the
Greek, while Ionians were introduced into Teos by Apoecus, a
great-grandchild of Melanthos, who showed no hostility either to the
Orkhomenians or to the Teians. A few years later there came men from
Athens and from Boeotia; the Attic contingent was under Damasus and
Naoklos, the sons of Kodros, while the Boeotians were led by Geres, a
Boeotian. Both parties were received by Apoecus and the Teians as
fellow-settlers.

The Erythraeans say that they came originally from Crete with Erythrus
the son of Rhadamanthus, and that this Erythrus was the founder of their
city. Along with the Cretans there dwelled in the city Lycians, Carians
and Pamphylians; Lycians because of their kinship with the Cretans, as
they came of old from Crete, having fled along with Sarpedon; Carians
because of their ancient friendship with Minos; Pamphylians because they
too belong to the Greek lineage, being among those who after the taking
of Troy wandered with Calchas. The peoples I have enumerated occupied
Erythraiwhen Kleopos the son of Kodros gathered men from all the cities
of Ionia, so many from each, and introduced them as settlers among the
Erythraeans.

The cities of Klazomenai and Phokaia were not inhabited before the
Ionians came to Asia. When the Ionians arrived, a wandering division of
them sent for a leader, Parphorus, from the Kolophonians, and founded
under Mount Ida a city which shortly afterwards they abandoned, and
returning to Ionia they founded Scyppium in the Kolophonian territory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.3.9">

They left of their own free-will Kolophonian territory also, and so
occupied the land which they still hold, and built on the mainland the
city of Klazomenai. Later they crossed over to the island through their
fear of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\]. But in course
of time Alexander the son of Philip was destined to make Klazomenai a
peninsula by a mole from the mainland to the island. Of these
Clazomenians the greater part were not Ionians, but people from Kleonai
and Phleious, who abandoned their cities when the Dorians had returned
to Peloponnesus.

The people of Phokaia are by birth from the land under Parnassus still
called Phokis, who crossed to Asia with the Athenians Philogenes and
Damon. Their land they took from the Cymaeans, not by war but by
agreement. When the Ionians would not admit them to the Ionian
confederacy until they accepted kings originating from the lineage of
the Kodridai, they accepted Deoetes, Periklos and Abartos from
Erythraiand from Teos.

The cities of the Ionians on the islands are Samos over against Mykale
and Chios opposite Mimas. Asios, the son of Amphiptolemos, a Samian,
says in his epic that there were born to Phoenix Astypalaia and Europa,
whose mother was Perimede, the daughter of Oineus; that Astypalaia had
by Poseidon a son Ankaios, who reigned over those called Leleges; that
Ankaios took to wife Samia, the daughter of the river Maeander, and
begat Perilaos, Enudus, Samus, Alitherses and a daughter Parthenope; and
that Parthenope had a son Lycomedes by Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.4.2">

Thus far Asios in his poem. But on the occasion to which I refer the
inhabitants of the island received the Ionians as settlers more of
necessity than through good.will. The leader of the Ionians was Prokles,
the son of Pityreus, Epidaurian himself like the greater part of his
followers, who had been expelled from Epidauria by Deiphontes and the
Argives. This Prokles was descended from Ion, son of Xuthus. But the
Ephesians under Androklos made war on Leogorus, the son of Prokles, who
reigned in Samos after his father, and after conquering them in a battle
drove the Samians out of their island, accusing them of conspiring with
the Carians against the Ionians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.4.3">

The Samians fled and some of them made their home in an island near
Thrace, and as a result of their settling there the name of the island
was changed from Dardania to Samothrace. Others with Leogorus threw a
wall round Anaea on the mainland opposite Samos, and ten years after
crossed over, expelled the Ephesians and reoccupied the island.

Some say that the sanctuary of Hērā in Samos was established by those
who sailed in the Argo, and that these brought the image from Argos. But
the Samians themselves hold that the goddess was born in the island by
the side of the river Imbrasus under the withy that even in my time grew
in the Hēraion. That this sanctuary is very old might be inferred
especially by considering the image; for it is the work of an Aeginetan,
Smilis, the son of Eukleides. This Smilis was a contemporary of
Daidalos, though of less repute.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.4.5">

Daidalos belonged to the royal Athenian clan called the Metionidai, and
he was rather famous among all men not only for his art but also for his
wandering and his misfortunes. For he killed his sister’s son, and
knowing the customs of his city he went into exile of his own accord to
Minos in Crete. There he made images for Minos and for the daughters of
Minos, as Homer sets forth in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>[^419]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.4.6">

but being condemned by Minos on some charge he was thrown into prison
along with his son. He escaped from Crete and came to Cocalus at Inycus,
a city of Sicily. Thereby he became the cause of war between Sicilians
and Cretans, because when Minos demanded him back, Cocalus refused to
give him up. He was so much admired by the daughters of Cocalus for his
artistic skill that to please him these women actually plotted against
Minos to put him to death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.4.7">

It is plain that the renown of Daidalos spread over all Sicily and even
over the greater part of Italy. But as for Smilis, it is not clear that
he visited any places save Samos and Elis. But to these he did travel,
and he it was who made the image of Hērā in Samos.

… Ion the tragic poet says in his history that Poseidon came to the
island when it was uninhabited; that there he had intercourse with a
nymph, and that when she was in her pains there was a fall of snow
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">chion</span>\], and that
accordingly Poseidon called his son Chios. Ion also says that Poseidon
had intercourse with another nymph, by whom he had Agelus and Melas;

Chios, accompanied by his sons Talus, Euanthes, Melas, Salagus and
Athamas.

Carians too came to the island, in the reign of Oinopion, and Abantes
from Euboea. Oinopion and his sons were succeeded by Amphiklos, who
because of an oracle from Delphi came from Histiaea in Euboea. Three
generations from Amphiklos, Hector, who also had made himself king, made
war on those Abantes and Carians who lived in the island, slew some in
battle, and forced others to surrender and depart.

When the Chians were rid of war, it occurred to Hector that they ought
to unite with the Ionians in sacrificing at Panionium. It is said that
the Ionian confederacy gave him a tripod as a prize for valor. Such was
the account of the Chians that I found given by Ion. However, he gives
no reason why the Chians are classed with the Ionians.

Smyrna, one of the twelve Aeolian cities, built on that site which even
now they call the old city, was seized by Ionians who set out from
Kolophon and displaced the Aeolians; subsequently, however, the Ionians
allowed the Smyrnaeans to take their place in the general assembly at
Panionium. The modern city was founded by Alexander, the son of Philip,
in accordance with a vision in a dream.

It is said that Alexander was hunting on Mount Pagus, and that after the
hunt was over he came to a sanctuary of the Nemeses, and found there a
spring and a plane tree in front of the sanctuary, growing over the
water. While he slept under the plane tree it is said that the Nemeses
appeared and ordered him to found a city there and to remove into it the
Smyrnaeans from the old city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.5.3">

So the Smyrnaeans sent ambassadors to Klaros to make inquiries about the

The land of the Ionians has the finest possible climate, and sanctuaries
such as are to be found nowhere else. First because of its size and
wealth is that of the Ephesian goddess, and then come two unfinished
sanctuaries of Apollo, the one in Brankhidai, in Milesian territory, and
the one at Klaros in the land of the Kolophonians. Besides these, two
temples in Ionia were burned down by the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\], the one of
Hērā in Samos and that of Athena at Phokaia. Damaged though they are by
fire, I found them a wonder.

You would be delighted too with the sanctuary of Hēraklēs at Erythrai
and with the temple of Athena at Priene, the latter because of its image
and the former on account of its age. The image is like neither the
Aeginetan, as they are called, nor yet the most ancient Attic images; it
is absolutely Egyptian, if ever there was such. There was a wooden raft,
on which the god set out from Tyre in Phoenicia. The reason for this we
are not told even by the Erythraeans themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.5.6">

They say that when the raft reached the Ionian sea it came to rest at
the cape called Mesate (Middle) which is on the mainland, just midway
between the harbor of the Erythraeans and the island of Chios. When the
raft rested off the cape the Erythraeans made great efforts, and the
Chians no less, both being keen to land the image on their own shores.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.5.7">

At last a man of Erythrai (his name was Phormion) who gained a living by
the sea and by catching fish, but had lost his sight through disease,
saw a vision in a dream to the effect that the women of Erythraimust cut
off their locks, and in this way the men would, with a rope woven from
the hair, tow the raft to their shores. The women of the citizens
absolutely refused to obey the dream;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.5.8">

but the Thracian women, both the slaves and the free who lived there,
offered themselves to be shorn. And so the men of Erythraitowed the raft
ashore. Accordingly no women except Thracian women are allowed within
the sanctuary of Hēraklēs, and the hair rope is still kept by the
natives. The same people say that the fisherman recovered his sight and
retained it for the rest of his life.

There is also in Erythraia temple of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Poliás</span> \[‘of the Polis’\]

in either hand and wears a firmament on her head. That this image is the
work of Endoeus we inferred, among other signs, from the workmanship,
and especially from the white marble images of Graces and Seasons that
stand in the open before the entrance. A sanctuary too of Asklepios was
made by the Smyrnaeans in my time between Mount Coryphe and a sea into
which no other water flows.

Ionia has other things to record besides its sanctuaries and its
climate. There is, for instance, in the land of the Ephesians the river
Kenkhrios, the strange mountain of Pion and the spring Halitaea. The
land of Miletus has the spring Biblis, of whose love the poets have
sung. In the land of Kolophon is the grove of Apollo, of ash trees, and

When the Ionians were gone the Achaeans divided their land among
themselves and settled in their cities. These were twelve in number, at
least such as were known to all the Greek world; Dyme, the nearest to
Elis, after it Olenos, Pharai, Triteia, Rhypes, Aigion, Ceryneia, Bura,
Helike also and Aigai, Aigeira and Pellene, the last city on the side of
Sikyonia. In them, which had previously been inhabited by Ionians,
settled the Achaeans and their princes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.6.2">

Those who held the greatest power among the Achaeans were the sons of
Teisamenos, Daimenes, Sparton, Tellis and Leontomenes; his eldest son,
Kometes, had already crossed with a fleet to Asia. These then at the
time held sway among the Achaeans along with Damasias, the son of
Penthilos, the son of Orestes, who on his father’s side was cousin to
the sons of Teisamenos. Equally powerful with the chiefs already
mentioned were two Achaeans from Lacedaemon, Preugenes and his son,
whose name was Patreus. The Achaeans allowed them to establish a city in
their territory, and to it was given the name Patrai from Patreus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.6.3">

The wars of the Achaeans were as follow. In the expedition of Agamemnon
to Troy they furnished, while still dwelling in Lacedaemon and Argos,
the largest contingent in the Greek army. When the Persians under Xerxes
attacked Greece[^421] the Achaeans it is clear had no part in the
advance of Leonidas to Thermopylae, nor in the naval actions fought by
the Athenians with Themistocles off Euboea and at Salamis, and they are
not included in the Laconian or in the Attic list of allies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.6.4">

They were absent from the action at Plataea, for otherwise the Achaeans
would surely have had their name inscribed on the offering of the Greeks
at Olympia. My view is that they stayed at home to guard their several
fatherlands, while because of the Trojan War they scorned to be led by
Dorians of Lacedaemon. This became plain in course of time. For when
later on the Lacedaemonians began the war with the Athenians,[^422] the
Achaeans were eager for the alliance with Patrai, and were no less well
disposed towards Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.6.5">

Of the wars waged afterwards by the confederate Greeks, the Achaeans
took part in the battle of Khaironeia against the Macedonians under
Philip,[^423] but they say that they did not march out into Thessaly to
what is called the Lamian war,[^424] for they had not yet recovered from
the reverse in Boeotia. The local guide at Patrai used to say that the
wrestler Khilon was the only Achaean who took part in the action at
Lamia.

individual, although the Lydian commonwealth held aloof. A likeness of
this Adrastos in bronze was dedicated in front of the sanctuary of
Artemis Persikē by the Lydians, who wrote an inscription to the effect
that Adrastos died fighting for the Greeks against Leonnatus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.6.7">

The march to Thermopylae[^425] against the army of the Gauls was left
alone by all the Peloponnesians alike; for, as the barbarians had no
ships, the Peloponnesians anticipated no danger from the Gauls, if only
they walled off the Corinthian Isthmus from the sea at Lechaeum to the
other sea at Cenchreae.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.6.8">

This was the policy of all the Peloponnesians at this time. But when the
Gauls had somehow crossed in ships to Asia,[^426] the condition of the
Greeks was as follows. No Greek state was preeminent in strength. For
the Lacedaemonians were still prevented from recovering their former
prosperity by the reverse at Leuktra combined with the union of the
Arcadians at Megalopolis and the settlement of Messenians on their
border.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.6.9">

Thebes had been brought so low by Alexander[^427] that when, a few years
later, Kassandros brought back her people, they were too weak even to
hold their own. The Athenians had indeed the goodwill of Greece,
especially for their later exploits, but they never found it possible to
recover from the Macedonian war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.1">

When the Greeks no longer took concerted action, but each state acted
for itself alone, the Achaeans enjoyed their greatest power. For except
Pellene no Achaean city had at any time suffered from tyranny, while the
disasters of war and of pestilence touched Achaea less than any other
part of Greece. So we have what was called the Achaean League, and the
Achaeans had a concerted policy and carried out concerted actions.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.2">

As a place of assembly they resolved to have Aigion, for, after Helike
had been swallowed up by the sea, Aigion from of old surpassed in
reputation the other cities of Achaea, while at the time it enjoyed
great power. Of the remaining Greeks the Sikyonians were the first to
join the Achaean League, and after the Sikyonians there entered it yet
other Peloponnesians, some forthwith and others after an interval. Some
too who lived outside the Isthmus were persuaded to join the Achaean
League by its unbroken growth in power.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.3">

Alone among the Greeks the Lacedaemonians were the bitter enemies of the
Achaeans and openly carried on war against them. Pellene, a city of the
Achaeans, was captured by Agis, the son of Eudamidas, who was king at
Sparta; but he was immediately driven out by the Sikyonians under
Aratos. Kleomenes, the son of Leonidas, the son of Kleonymos, king of
the other royal house, won a decisive victory at Dyme over the
Sikyonians under Aratos, who attacked him, and afterwards concluded a
peace with the Achaeans and Antigonos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.4">

This Antigonos at the time ruled over the Macedonians, being the
guardian of Philip, the son of Demetrios, who was still a boy. He was
also a cousin of Philip, whose mother he had taken to wife. With this
Antigonos then and the Achaeans Kleomenes made peace, and immediately
broke all the oaths he had sworn by reducing to slavery Megalopolis, the
city of the Arcadians. Because of Kleomenes and his treachery the
Lacedaemonians suffered the reverse at Sellasia, where they[^428] were
defeated by the Achaeans under Antigonos. In my account of Arcadia[^429]
I shall again have occasion to mention Kleomenes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.5">

When Philip, the son of Demetrios, reached man’s estate, and Antigonos
without reluctance handed over the sovereignty of the Macedonians, he
struck fear into the hearts of all the Greeks. He copied Philip, the son
of Amyntas, who was not his ancestor but really his master, especially
by flattering those who were willing to betray their country for their
private advantage. At banquets he would give the right hand of
friendship offering cups filled not with wine but with deadly poison, a
thing which I believe never entered the head of Philip the son of
Amyntas, but poisoning sat very lightly on the conscience of Philip the
son of Demetrios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.6">

He also occupied with garrisons three towns to be used as bases against
Greece, and in his insolent contempt for the Greek people he called
these cities the keys of Greece. To watch Peloponnesus Corinth was
fortified with its citadel; to watch Euboea, the Boeotians and the men
of Phokis, to watch Khalkis-on-the-Euripos; against the Thessalians
themselves and the Aetolian people Philip occupied Magnesia at the foot
of Mount Pelium. The Athenians especially and the Aetolians he harried
with continual attacks and raids of bandits.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.7">

Already, in my account of Attica[^430] I have described the alliances of
Greeks and barbarians with the Athenians against Philip, and how the
weakness of their allies urged the Athenians to seek help from Rome. A
short time before, the Romans had sent a force ostensibly to help the
Aetolians against Philip, but really more to spy on the condition of
Macedonia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.8">

At the appeal of Athens the Romans despatched an army under Otilius, to
give him the name by which he was best known. For the Romans differ from
the Greeks in their being called, not by the names of their fathers, but
by three names at least, if not more, given to each man. Otilius had
received orders from the Romans to protect Athenians and Aetolians from
war with Philip.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.7.9">

Otilius carried out his orders up to a point, but displeased the Romans
in certain of his acts. Hestiaea in Euboea and Antikyra in Phokis, which
had been compelled to submit to Philip, he utterly destroyed. It was, I
think, for this reason that the senate, when they heard the news, sent
Flamininus to succeed Otilius in his command.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.1">

On his arrival Flamininus sacked Eretria, defeating the Macedonians who
were defending it. He then marched against Corinth, which was held by
Philip with a garrison, and sat down to besiege it, while at the same
time he sent to the Achaeans and ordered them to come to Corinth with an
army, if they desired to be called allies of Rome and at the same time
to show their goodwill to Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.2">

But the Achaeans greatly blamed Flamininus himself, and Otilius before
him, for their savage treatment of ancient Greek cities which had done
the Romans no harm, and were subject to the Macedonians against their
will. They foresaw too that the Romans were coming to impose their
domination both on Achaeans and on the rest of Greece, merely in fact to
take the place of Philip and the Macedonians. At the meeting of the
League many opposite views were put forward, but at last the Roman party
prevailed, and the Achaeans joined Flamininus in besieging Corinth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.3">

On being delivered from the Macedonians the Corinthians at once joined
the Achaean League; they had joined it on a previous occasion, when the
Sikyonians under Aratos drove all the garrison out of Acrocorinth,
killing Persaios, who had been placed in command of the garrison by
Antigonos. Hereafter the Achaeans were called allies of the Romans, and
in all respects right zealous allies they proved themselves to be. They
followed the Romans to Macedonia against Philip; they took part in the
campaign against the Aetolians; thirdly they fought side by side with
the Romans against the Syrians under Antiokhos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.4">

All that the Achaeans did against the Macedonians or the host of the
Syrians they did because of their friendship to the Romans; but against
the Aetolians they had a long standing private quarrel to settle. When
the tyranny of Nabis in Sparta was put down, a tyranny marked by extreme
ferocity, the affairs of Lacedaemon at once caught the attention of the
Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.5">

At this time the Achaeans brought the Lacedaemonians into the Achaean
confederacy, exacted from them the strictest justice, and razed the
walls of Sparta to the ground. These had been built at haphazard at the
time of the invasion of Demetrios, and afterwards of the people of
Epeiros under Pyrrhos, but under the tyranny of Nabis they had been
strengthened to the greatest possible degree of safety. So the Achaeans
destroyed the walls of Sparta, and also repealed the laws of Lycurgus
(Lykourgos) that dealt with the training of the youths, at the same time
ordering the youths to be trained after the Achaean method.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.6">

I shall treat of this more fully in my account of Arcadia.[^431] The
Lacedaemonians, deeply offended by the ordinances of the Achaeans, fled
to Metellus and the other commissioners who had come from Rome. They had
come, not at all to bring war upon Philip and the Macedonians, as peace
had already been made between Philip and the Romans, but to judge the
charges brought against Philip by the Thessalians and some men from
Epeiros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.7">

In actual fact Philip himself and the Macedonian ascendancy had been put
down by the Romans; Philip fighting against the Romans under Flamininus
was worsted at the place called Dog’s Heads,[^432] where in spite of his
desperate efforts Philip was so severely defeated in the encounter that
he lost the greater part of his army and agreed with the Romans to
evacuate all the cities in Greece that he had captured and forced to
submit.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.8">

By prayers of all sorts, however, and by vast expenditure he secured
from the Romans a nominal peace. The history of Macedonia, the power she
won under Philip the son of Amyntas, and her fall under the later
Philip, were foretold by the inspired Sibyl. This was her oracle:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.8.9">

“Ye Macedonians, boasting of your Argive kings,

</div>

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

To you the reign of a Philip will be both good and evil.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The first will make you kings over cities and peoples;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The younger will lose all the honor,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Defeated by men from west and east.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Now those who destroyed the Macedonian empire were the Romans, dwelling
in the west of Europe, and among the allies fighting on their side was
Attalus … who also commanded the army from Mysia, a land lying under the
rising sun.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.9.1">

On the occasion to which I referred Metellus and the other commissioners
resolved not to overlook the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, and asked
the officers of the League to summon the Achaeans to a meeting, so that
they might receive all together instructions to be gentler in their
treatment of Lacedaemon. The officers replied that they would call a
meeting of the Achaeans neither for them nor for anyone else who had not
a decree of the Roman senate approving the proposal for which the
assembly was to be held. Metellus and his colleagues, thinking that the
conduct of the Achaeans was very insolent, on their arrival at Rome made
before the senate many accusations against the Achaeans, not all of
which were true.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.9.2">

More accusations still against the Achaeans were made by Areus and
Alcibiadas, Lacedaemonians of great distinction at Sparta but ungrateful
to the Achaeans. For the Achaeans gave them a welcome when exiled by
Nabis, and on the tyrant’s death restored them to Sparta against the
will of the Lacedaemonian people. On this occasion, therefore, they too
arose and attacked the Achaeans with great vehemence before the senate;
accordingly, the Achaeans, at a meeting of their League, passed sentence
of death upon them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.9.3">

The Roman senate sent Appius and other commissioners to arbitrate
between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans. The mere sight of Appius
and his colleagues was sure to be displeasing to the Achaeans, for they
brought with them Areus and Alcibiadas, detested by the Achaeans at that
time beyond all other men. The commissioners vexed the Achaeans yet more
when they came to the assembly and delivered speeches more angry than
conciliatory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.9.4">

But Lykortas of Megalopolis, than whom no man was more highly esteemed
among the Arcadians, and whose friendship with Philopoimen had given him
something of his spirit, set forth the case for the Achaeans in a speech
suggesting that the Romans were somewhat to blame. But Appius and his
colleagues greeted the speech of Lykortas with jeers, acquitted Areus
and Alcibiadas of any offence against the Achaeans, and permitted the
Lacedaemonians to send an embassy to Rome. Such permission was a
contravention of the agreement between the Romans and the Achaeans,
which allowed the Achaeans as a body to send a deputation to the Roman
senate but forbade any city of the Achaean League to send a deputation
privately.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.9.5">

A deputation of the Achaeans was sent to oppose the Lacedaemonians, and
after speeches had been delivered by both sides before the senate, the
Romans again despatched the same commissioners, Appius and his former
colleagues in Greece, to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the
Achaeans. This commission restored to Sparta those whom the Achaeans had
exiled, and they remitted the penalties inflicted by the Achaeans on
those who had fled before their trial and had been condemned in their
absence. The Lacedaemonian connection with the Achaean League was not
broken, but foreign courts were established to deal with capital
charges; all other charges were to be submitted for judgment to the
Achaean League. The circuit of the city walls was restored by the
Spartans right from the foundations.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.9.6">

The restored Lacedaemonian exiles carried on various intrigues against
the Achaeans, hoping to vex them most by the following plot. They
persuaded to go up to Rome the exiles of the Achaeans, along with the
Messenians who had been held to be involved in the death of Philopoimen
and banished on that account by the Achaeans. Going up with them to Rome
they intrigued for the restoration of the exiles. As Appius was a
zealous supporter of the Lacedaemonians and opposed the Achaeans in
everything, the plans of the Messenian and Achaean exiles were bound to
enjoy an easy success. Despatches were at once sent by the senate to
Athens and Aetolia, with instructions to bring back the Messenians and
Achaeans to their homes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.9.7">

This caused the greatest vexation to the Achaeans. They bethought
themselves of the injustice they had suffered at the hands of the
Romans, and how all their services had proved of no avail; to please the
Romans they had made war against Philip, against the Aetolians and
afterwards against Antiokhos, and after all there was preferred before
them a band of exiles, whose hands were stained with blood.
Nevertheless, they decided to give way.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.1">

Such were the events that took place on this occasion. The most impious
of all crimes, the betrayal for private gain of fatherland and
fellow-citizens, was destined to be the beginning of woes for the
Achaeans as for others, for it has never been absent from Greece since
the birth of time. In the reign of Dareios, the son of Hystaspes, the
king of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\],[^433] the
cause of the Ionians was ruined because all the Samian captains except
eleven betrayed the Ionian fleet.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.2">

After reducing Ionia the Persians enslaved Eretria also, the most famous
citizens turning traitors, Philagrus, the son of Cyneas, and Euphorbos,
the son of Alkimakhos. When Xerxes invaded Greece,[^434] Thessaly was
betrayed by Aleuades,[^435] and Thebes by Attaginos and Timegenidas, who
were the foremost citizen of Thebes. After the Peloponnesian war, Xenias
of Elis attempted to betray Elis to the Lacedaemonians under Agis,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.3">

and the so-called “friends” of Lysander at no time relaxed their efforts
to hand over their countries to him. In the reign of Philip, the son of
Amyntas, Lacedaemon is the only Greek city to be found that was not
betrayed; the other cities in Greece were ruined more by treachery than
they had been previously by the plague. Alexander, the son of Philip,
was so favored by fortune that he had little need worth mentioning of
traitors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.4">

But when the Greeks suffered defeat at Lamia,[^436] Antipatros, in his
eagerness to cross over to the war in Asia, wished to patch up a peace
quickly, and it mattered nothing to him if he left free Athens and the
whole of Greece. But Demades and the other traitors in Athens persuaded
Antipatros to have no kindly thoughts towards the Greeks, and by
frightening the Athenian people were the cause of Macedonian garrisons
being brought into Athens and most other cities.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.5">

My statement is confirmed by the following fact. The Athenians after the
disaster in Boeotia did not become subjects of Philip, although they
lost two thousand prisoners in the action and one thousand killed. But
when about two hundred at most fell at Lamia they were enslaved by the
Lacedaemonians. So the plague of treachery never failed to afflict
Greece, and it was an Achaean, Kallikrates, who at the time I speak of
made the Achaeans completely subject to Rome. But the beginning of their
troubles proved to be Perseus and the destruction by the Romans of the
Macedonian empire.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.6">

Perseus, the son of Philip, who was at peace with Rome in accordance
with a treaty his father Philip had made, resolved to break the oaths,
and leading an army against the Sapaeans and their king Abrupolis,
allies of the Romans, made their country desolate. These Sapaeans
Archilochus[^437] mentions in an iambic line.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.7">

The Macedonians and Perseus were conquered because of this wrong done to
the Sapaeans, and afterwards ten Roman senators were sent to arrange the
affairs of Macedonia in the best interests of the Romans. When they came
to Greece, Kallikrates curried favor with them, no form of flattery,
whether in word or in deed, being too gross for him to use. One member
of the commission, a most dishonorable man, Kallikrates so captivated
that he actually persuaded him to attend the meeting of the Achaean
League.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.8">

When he entered the assembly he declared that while Perseus was at war
with Rome the most influential Achaeans, besides helping him generally,
had supplied him with money. So he required the Achaeans to condemn them
to death. After their condemnation, he said, he would himself disclose
the names of the culprits. His words were regarded as absolutely unfair,
and the members present demanded that, if certain Achaeans had sided
with Perseus, their individual names should be mentioned, it being
unreasonable to condemn them before this was done.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.9">

Thereupon the Roman, as he was getting the worst of the argument,
brazenly asserted that every Achaean who had held the office of general
was included in his accusation, since one and all had favored the cause
of the Macedonians and Perseus. This he said at the bidding of
Kallikrates. After him rose Xenon, a man of great repute among the
Achaeans, and said “The truth about this accusation is as follows. I
myself have served the Achaeans as their general, but I am guilty
neither of treachery to Rome nor of friendship to Perseus. I am
therefore ready to submit to trial either before the Achaean diet or
before the Romans themselves.” This frank speech was prompted by a clear
conscience,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.10">

but the Roman at once grasped the pretext, and sent for trial before the
Roman court all those whom Kallikrates accused of supporting Perseus.
Never before had Greeks been so treated, for not even the most powerful
of the Macedonians, Philip, the son of Amyntas, and Alexander,
despatched by force to Macedonia the Greeks who were opposed to them,
but allowed them to plead their case before the Amphiktyones.[^438]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.11">

But on this occasion it was decided to send up to Rome every one of the
Achaean people, however innocent, whom Kallikrates chose to accuse. They
amounted to over a thousand men. The Romans, holding that all these had
already been condemned by the Achaeans, distributed them throughout
Etruria and its cities, and though the Achaeans sent embassy after
embassy to plead on behalf of the men, no notice was taken of the
petitions.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.10.12">

Sixteen years later,[^439] when the number of Achaeans in Italy was
reduced to three hundred at most, the Romans set them free, considering
that their punishment was sufficient. But those who ran away, either at
once when they were being brought up to Rome, or later on from the
cities to which the Romans sent them, were saved from punishment by no
defence if they were recaptured.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.1">

The Romans again despatched a senator to Greece. His name was Gallus,
and his instructions were to arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and
the Argives in the case of a disputed piece of territory. This Gallus on
many occasions behaved towards the Greek people with great arrogance,
both in word and deed, while he made a complete mock of the
Lacedaemonians and Argives.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.2">

These states had reached the highest degree of renown, and in a famous
war of old had poured out their blood like water because of a dispute
about boundaries, while later Philip, the son of Amyntas, had acted as
arbitrator to settle their differences; yet now Gallus disdained to
arbitrate in person, and entrusted the decision to Kallikrates, the most
abominable wretch in all Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.3">

There also came to Gallus the Aetolians living at Pleuron, who wished to
detach themselves from the Achaean confederacy. Gallus allowed them to
send on their own an embassy to Rome, and the Romans allowed them to
secede from the Achaean League. The senate also commissioned Gallus to
separate from the Achaean confederacy as many states as he could.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.4">

While he was carrying out his instructions, the Athenian populace sacked
Oropus, a state subject to them. The act was one of necessity rather
than of free-will, as the Athenians at the time suffered the direst
poverty, because the Macedonian war had crushed them more than any other
Greeks. So the Oropians appealed to the Roman senate. It decided that an
injustice had been committed, and instructed the Sikyonians to inflict a
fine on the Athenians commensurate with the unprovoked harm done by them
to Oropus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.5">

When the Athenians did not appear in time for the trial, the Sikyonians
inflicted on them a fine of five hundred talents, which the Roman senate
on the appeal of the Athenians remitted with the exception of one
hundred talents. Not even this reduced fine did the Athenians pay, but
by promises and bribes they beguiled the Oropians into an agreement that
an Athenian garrison should enter Oropus, and that the Athenians should
take hostages from the Oropians. If in the future the Oropians should
have any complaint to make against the Athenians, then the Athenians
were to withdraw their garrison from Oropus and give the hostages back
again.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.6">

After no long interval the Oropians were wronged by certain of the
garrison. They accordingly despatched envoys to Athens to ask for the
restoration of their hostages and to request that the garrison be
withdrawn according to the agreement. The Athenians refused to do either
of these things, saying that the blame lay, not with the Athenian
people, but with the men of the garrison. They promised, however, that
the culprits should he brought to account.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.7">

The Oropians then appealed to the Achaeans for aid, but these refused to
give it out of friendship and respect for the Athenians. Thereupon the
Oropians promised Menalkidas, a Lacedaemonian who was then general of
the Achaeans, a gift of ten talents if he would induce the Achaeans to
help them. Menalkidas promised half of the money to Kallikrates, who on
account of his friendship with the Romans had most influence among the
Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.11.8">

Kallikrates was persuaded to adopt the plan of Menalkidas, and it was
decided to help the Oropians against the Athenians. News of this was
brought to the Athenians, who, with all the speed each could, came to
Oropus, again dragged away anything they had overlooked in the previous
raids, and brought away the garrison. As the Achaeans were too late to
render help, Menalkidas and Kallikrates urged them to invade Attica. But
they met with opposition, especially from Lacedaemon, and the army
withdrew.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.1">

Though the Oropians had received no help from the Achaeans, nevertheless
Menalkidas extorted the money from them. But when he had the bribe in
his hands, he began to think it hard luck that he had to share his gains
with Kallikrates. At first he had recourse to procrastination and deceit
about payment, but shortly he plucked up courage and flatly refused to
give anything.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.2">

It confirms the truth of the proverb that one fire burns more fiercely
than another, one wolf is more savage than other wolves, one hawk
swifter than another, that Menalkidas outdid in treachery Kallikrates,
the worst rascal of his time, one who could never resist a bribe of any
kind. He fell foul of the Athenians without gaining anything, and, when
Menalkidas laid down his office, accused him before the Achaeans on a
capital charge. He said that Menalkidas, when on an embassy to Rome, had
worked against the Achaeans and had done all he could to separate Sparta
from the Achaean League.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.3">

Thereupon, as the danger he ran was extreme, Menalkidas gave three of
the talents he received from Oropus to Diaios of Megalopolis, who had
succeeded him as general of the Achaeans, and on this occasion was so
active, because of the bribe, that he succeeded in saving Menalkidas in
spite of the opposition of the Achaeans. The Achaeans, individually and
as a body, held Diaios responsible for the acquittal of Menalkidas, but
he distracted their attention from the charges made against him by
directing it towards more ambitious hopes, using to deceive them the
following pretext.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.4">

The Lacedaemonians appealed to the Roman senate about a disputed
territory, and the senate replied to the appeal by decreeing that all
except capital cases should be under the jurisdiction of the Achaean
League. Such was the senate’s answer, but Diaios did not tell the
Achaeans the truth, but cajoled them by the declaration that the Roman
senate had committed to them the right to condemn a Spartan to death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.5">

So the Achaeans claimed the right to try a Lacedaemonian on a capital
charge, but the Lacedaemonians would not admit that Diaios spoke the
truth, and wished to refer the point to the Roman senate. But the
Achaeans seized another pretext, that no state belonging to the Achaean
League had the right to send an embassy on its own to the Roman senate,
but only in conjunction with the rest of the League.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.6">

These disputes were the cause of a war between the Lacedaemonians and
the Achaeans, and the former, realizing that they were not a match for
their opponents, sent envoys to their cities and entered into personal
negotiations with Diaios. The cities all made the same reply, that it
was unlawful to turn a deaf ear to their general when he proclaimed a
campaign; for Diaios, who was in command of the Achaeans, declared that
he would march to make war, not on Sparta but on those that were
troubling her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.7">

When the Spartan senate inquired how many he considered were guilty, he
reported to them the names of twenty-four citizens of the very front
rank in Sparta. Thereupon was carried a motion of Agasisthenes, whose
advice on this occasion enhanced the already great reputation he
enjoyed. He ordered the twenty-four to go into voluntary exile from
Lacedaemon, instead of bringing war upon Sparta by remaining where they
were; if they exiled themselves to Rome, he declared, they would before
long be restored to their country by the Romans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.8">

So they departed, underwent a nominal trial at Sparta, and were
condemned to death. The Achaeans on their side despatched to Rome
Kallikrates and Diaios to oppose the exiles from Sparta before the
senate. Kallikrates died of disease on the journey, and even if he had
reached Rome I do not know that he would have been of any assistance to
the Achaeans—perhaps he would have been the cause of greater troubles.
The debate between Diaios and Menalkidas before the senate was marked by
fluency rather than by decency on either side.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.12.9">

The answer of the senate to their remarks was that they were sending
envoys to settle the disputes between the Lacedaemonians and the
Achaeans. The journey of the envoys from Rome proved rather slow, giving
Diaios a fresh opportunity of deceiving the Achaeans and Menalkidas of
deceiving the Lacedaemonians. Diaios misled the Achaeans into the belief
that the Roman senate had decreed the complete subjection to them of the
Lacedaemonians; Menalkidas deceived the Lacedaemonians into thinking
that the Romans had entirely freed them from the Achaean League.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.1">

So the result of the debate was that the Achaeans again came near to
actual war with the Lacedaemonians, and Damokritos, who had been elected
general of the Achaeans at this time, proceeded to mobilize an army
against Sparta. But about this time there arrived in Macedonia a Roman
force under Metellus, whose object was to put down the rebellion of
Andriskos, the son of Perseus, the son of Philip. The war in Macedonia,
it turned out, was easily decided in favor of the Romans,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.2">

but Metellus urged the envoys, sent by the Roman senate to settle the
affairs of Asia, to parley with the chiefs of the Achaeans before making
the crossing. They were to order them not to attack Sparta, but to await
the arrival from Rome of the envoys sent for the purpose of arbitrating
between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.3">

They delivered their instructions to the Achaeans under Damokritos when
these had already begun a campaign against Lacedaemon, and so, realizing
that the Achaeans were set against their advice, proceeded on their way
to Asia. The Lacedaemonians, with a spirit greater than their strength,
took up arms, and sallied forth to defend their country. But they were
soon crushed; a thousand of their bravest youths fell in the battle, and
the rest of the soldiery fled towards the city with all the haste they
could.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.4">

If Damokritos had made a vigorous effort, the Achaeans could have dashed
into the walls of Sparta along with the fugitives from the field of
battle. As it was, he at once recalled the Achaeans from the pursuit,
and confined his future operations to raids and plunder, instead of
prosecuting the siege with energy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.5">

So Damokritos withdrew his army, and the Achaeans sentenced him to pay a
fine of fifty talents for his treachery. Being unable to pay, he left
the Peloponnesus and went into exile. Diaios, who was elected general
after Damokritos, agreed, when Metellus sent another embassy, to involve
the Lacedaemonians in no war, but to await the arrival of the
arbitrators from Rome.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.6">

But he invented another trick to embarrass the Lacedaemonians. He
induced the towns around Sparta to be friendly to the Achaeans, and even
introduced garrisons into them, to be Achaean bases against Sparta.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.7">

The Lacedaemonians elected Menalkidas to be their general against
Diaios, and although they were utterly unprepared for war, being
especially ill-provided with money, while in addition their land had
remained unsown, he nevertheless dared to break the truce, and took by
assault and sacked Iasos, a town on the borders of Laconia, but at that
time subject to the Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.13.8">

Having again stirred up war between Lacedaemonians and Achaeans he
incurred blame at the hands of his countrymen, and, failing to find a
way of escape for the Lacedaemonians from the peril that threatened
them, he took his own life by poison. Such was the end of Menalkidas. At
the time he was in command of the Lacedaemonians, and previously he had
commanded the Achaeans. In the former office he proved a most stupid
general, in the latter an unparalleled villain.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.14.1">

There also arrived in Greece the envoys despatched from Rome to
arbitrate between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, among them being
Orestes. He invited to visit him the magistrates in each of the Greek
cities, along with Diaios. When they arrived at his lodging, he
proceeded to disclose to them the whole story, that the Roman senate
decreed that neither the Lacedaemonians nor yet Corinth itself should
belong to the Achaean League, and that Argos, Herakleia by Mount Oitē
and the Arcadian Orkhomenos should be released from the Achaean
confederacy. For they were not, he said, related at all to the Achaeans,
and but latecomers to the League.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.14.2">

The magistrates of the Achaeans did not wait for Orestes to conclude,
but while he was yet speaking ran out of the house and summoned the
Achaeans to an assembly. When the Achaeans heard the decision of the
Romans, they at once turned against the Spartans who happened to be then
residing in Corinth, and arrested every one, not only those whom they
knew for certain to be Lacedaemonians, but also all those they suspected
to be such from the cut of their hair, or because of their shoes, their
clothes or even their names. Some of them, who succeeded in taking
refuge in the lodging of Orestes, they actually attempted even from
there to drag away by force.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.14.3">

Orestes and his colleagues tried to check their violence, reminding them
that they were committing unprovoked acts of criminal insolence against
the Romans. A few days afterwards the Achaeans shut up in prison the
Lacedaemonians they held under arrest, but separated from them the
foreigners and let them go. They also despatched to Rome Thearidas, with
certain other members of the Achaean government. These set out, but
meeting on the journey the Roman envoys who had been sent after Orestes
to deal with the dispute between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans,
they too turned back.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.14.4">

When the time came for Diaios to relinquish his office, Kritolaos was
elected general by the Achaeans. This Kritolaos was seized with a keen
but utterly unthinking passion to make war against the Romans. The
envoys from the Romans had by this time already arrived to adjudicate on
the dispute between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans, and
Kritolaoshad a conference with them at Tegea in Arcadia, being most
unwilling to summon the Achaeans to meet them in a general assembly.
However, in the hearing of the Romans he sent messengers with
instructions to summon the deputies to the assembly, but privately he
sent orders to the deputies of the various cities to absent themselves
from the meeting.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.14.5">

When the deputies did not attend, Kritolaosshowed very clearly how he
was hoodwinking the Romans. He urged them to wait for another meeting of
the Achaeans, to take place five months later, declaring that he would
not confer with them without the general assembly of the Achaeans. When
the envoys realized that they were being deceived, they departed for
Rome but Kritolaossummoned a meeting of the Achaeans in Corinth, and
persuaded them both to take up arms against Sparta and also to declare
war openly on Rome.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.14.6">

For a king or state to undertake a war and be unlucky is due to the
jealousy of some divinity rather than to the fault of the combatants;
but audacity combined with weakness should be called madness rather than
ill-luck. But it was such a combination that overthrew Kritolaosand the
Achaeans. The Achaeans were also encouraged by Pytheas, who at that time
was Boeotarch at Thebes, and the Thebans promised to give enthusiastic
support in the war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.14.7">

The Thebans had been sentenced, at the first ruling given by Metellus,
to pay a fine for invading the territory of Phokis with an armed force;
at the second to compensate the Euboeans for laying waste Euboea; at the
third to compensate the people of Amphissa for ravaging their territory
when the wheat was ripe for harvest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.1">

The Romans, learning the news from the envoys sent to Greece and from
the despatches of Metellus, decided that the Achaeans were in the wrong,
and they ordered Mummius, the consul elected for that year, to lead a
fleet with a land force against them. As soon as Metellus learned that
Mummius and his army were coming[^440] to fight the Achaeans, he was
full of enthusiasm to bring the war to a conclusion without help before
Mummius reached Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.2">

So he despatched envoys to the Achaeans, bidding them release from the
League the Lacedaemonians and the other states mentioned in the order of
the Romans, promising that the Romans would entirely forgive them for
their disobedience on the previous occasion. While making these
proposals for peace he marched from Macedonia through Thessaly and along
the gulf of Lamia. But Kritolaosand the Achaeans would listen to no
suggestions for an agreement, and sat down to besiege Herakleia, which
refused to join the Achaean League.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.3">

Then, when Kritolaoswas informed by his scouts that the Romans under
Metellus had crossed the Sperkheios, he fled to Skarpheia in Lokris,
without daring even to draw up the Achaeans in the pass between
Herakleia and Thermopylae, and to await Metellus there. To such a depth
of terror did he sink that brighter hopes were not suggested even by the
spot itself, the site of the Lacedaemonian effort to save Greece,[^441]
and of the no less glorious exploit of the Athenians against the
Gauls.[^442]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.4">

Kritolaosand the Achaeans took to flight, but at a short distance from
Skarpheia they were overtaken by the men of Metellus, who killed many
and took about a thousand prisoners. Kritolaoswas neither seen alive
after the battle nor found among the dead. If he dared to plunge into
the marsh of the sea at the foot of Mount Oitē he must inevitably have
sunk into the depths without leaving a trace to tell the tale.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.5">

So the end of Kritolaosoffers a wide field for conjecture. A thousand
picked troops of Arcadia, who had joined Kritolaosin his enterprise,
took the field and advanced as far as Elateia in Phokis, into which city
they were received by the inhabitants on the ground of some supposed
ancient connection between them. But when the men of Phokis heard of the
disaster to Kritolaos and the Achaeans, they ordered the Arcadians to
depart from Elateia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.6">

As they were retreating to the Peloponnesus the Romans under Metellus
fell upon them near Khaironeia. It was then that the vengeance of the
Greek gods overtook the Arcadians, who were slain by the Romans on the
very spot on which they had deserted from the Greeks who were struggling
at Khaironeia against the Macedonians under Philip.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.7">

Diaios once more came forward to command the Achaean army. He proceeded
to set free slaves, following the example of Miltiades and the Athenians
before the battle of Marathon, and enlisted from the cities of the
Achaeans and Arcadians those who were of military age. The muster,
including the slaves, amounted roughly to six hundred cavalry and
fourteen thousand foot.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.8">

And here Diaios sank into utter folly. Although he knew that Kritolaos
and the whole force of Achaea had put up such a poor fight against
Metellus, he nevertheless detached about four thousand, put them under
the command of Alkamenes, and despatched them to Megara to garrison the
city, and to stay the advance of Metellus and the Romans, should they
march that way.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.9">

When the picked Arcadian troops had been overthrown near Khaironeia,
Metellus moved his army and marched against Thebes, for the Thebans had
joined the Achaeans in investing Herakleia, and had taken part in the
engagement of Skarpheia. Then the inhabitants, of both sexes and of all
ages, abandoned the city and wandered about Boeotia, or took refuge on
the tops of the mountains.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.10">

But Metellus would not allow either the burning of sanctuaries of the
gods or the destruction of buildings, and he forbade his men to kill any
Theban or take prisoner any fugitive. If, however, Pytheas should be
caught, he was to be brought before him. Pytheas was discovered
immediately, brought before Metellus and punished. When the army
approached Megara, Alkamenes and his men did not face it, but
straightway fled to the camp of the Achaeans in Corinth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.15.11">

The Megarians surrendered their city to the Romans without a blow, and
when Metellus came to the Isthmus he again made overtures to the
Achaeans for an agreed peace. For he was possessed of a strong desire to
settle by himself the affairs of both Macedonia and Achaea. His efforts,
however, were thwarted by the senselessness of Diaios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.1">

Mummius, bringing with him Orestes, the commissioner sent earlier to
deal with the dispute between the Lacedaemonians and the Achaeans,
reached the Roman army at early dawn, and sending Metellus and his
forces to Macedonia, himself waited at the Isthmus for his whole force
to assemble. There came three thousand five hundred cavalry, while the
infantry amounted to twenty-three thousand. They were joined by a
company of Cretan archers and by Philopoimen, at the head of some troops
sent by Attalus from Pergamon on the Kaïkos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.2">

Certain of the Italian troops along with the auxiliaries were stationed
by Mummius twelve stadium-lengths away, to be an outpost for the whole
army. The contempt of the Romans made them keep a careless look-out, and
the Achaeans, attacking them in the first watch, killed some, drove yet
more back to the camp, and took some five hundred shields. Puffed up
with this success the Achaeans marched out to battle before the Romans
began their attack.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.3">

But when Mummius advanced to meet them, the Achaean horse at once took
to flight, without waiting for even the first charge of the Roman
cavalry. The infantry were depressed at the rout of their horse, but
nevertheless received the onslaught of the Roman men-at-arms;
overwhelmed by numbers and faint with their wounds they offered a
spirited resistance, until a thousand picked Romans fell upon their
flank and utterly routed them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.4">

If after the battle Diaios had boldly thrown himself into Corinth and
received the fugitives within the walls, the Achaeans might have been
able to get favorable terms from Mummius, by putting him to the trouble
of a protracted siege. As it was, when the Achaeans were but beginning
to yield, Diaios fled straight for Megalopolis, his conduct towards the
Achaeans showing a marked contrast to that of Kallistratos, the son of
Empedus, towards the Athenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.5">

This man commanded some cavalry in Sicily, and when the Athenians and
their partners in the expedition were being massacred at the river
Asinarus, he courageously cut a way through the enemy at the head of his
horsemen. He brought most of them safe to Catana, and then returned by
the same way back to Syracuse. Finding the enemy still plundering the
Athenian camp, he cut down some five of them, and then both he and his
horse received mortal wounds and died.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.6">

So he won glory for the Athenians and for himself, by saving the men
under his command and seeking his own death. But Diaios having ruined
the Achaeans came to tell the tidings of disaster to the people of
Megalopolis, killed his wife with his own hand, just to save her from
being taken prisoner, and then committed suicide by drinking poison. He
may be compared to Menalkidas for his avarice, and proved equally like
him in the cowardice of his death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.7">

As soon as night fell, the Achaeans who had escaped to Corinth after the
battle fled from the city, and there fled with them most of the
Corinthians themselves. At first Mummius hesitated to enter Corinth,
although the gates were open, as he suspected that an ambush had been
laid within the walls. But on the third day after the battle he
proceeded to storm Corinth and to set it on fire.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.8">

The majority of those found in it were put to the sword by the Romans,
but the women and children Mummius sold into slavery. He also sold all
the slaves who had been set free, had fought on the side of the
Achaeans, and had not fallen at once on the field of battle. The most
admired votive offerings and works of art were carried off by Mummius;
those of less account he gave to Philopoimen, the general sent by
Attalus; even in my day there were Corinthian spoils at Pergamon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.9">

The walls of all the cities that had made war against Rome Mummius
demolished, disarming the inhabitants, even before assistant
commissioners were despatched from Rome, and when these did arrive, he
proceeded to put down democracies and to establish governments based on
a property qualification. Tribute was imposed on Greece, and those with
property were forbidden to acquire possessions in a foreign country.
Racial confederacies, whether of Achaeans, or of the people of Phokis,
or of Boeotians, or of any other Greek people, were one and all put
down.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.16.10">

A few years later the Romans took pity on Greece, restored the various
old racial confederacies, with the right to acquire property in a
foreign country, and remitted the fines imposed by Mummius. For he had
ordered the Boeotians to pay a hundred talents to the people of
Herakleia and Euboea, and the Achaeans to pay two hundred to the
Lacedaemonians. Although the Romans granted the Greeks remission of
these payments, yet down to my day a Roman governor has been sent to the
country. The Romans call him the Governor, not of Greece, but of Achaea,
because the cause of the subjection of Greece was the Achaeans, at that
time at the head of the Greek nation.[^443] This war came to an end when
Antitheus was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the hundred and sixtieth Olympiad,[^444] at which Diodoros of Sikyon was
victorious.[^445]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.1">

It was at this time that Greece was struck with universal and utter
prostration, although parts of it from the beginning had suffered ruin
and devastation through the agency of the superhuman power
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\]. Argos, a city
that reached the zenith of its power in the days of the heroes, as they
are called, was deserted by the good will
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò eumenes</span>\] of fortune
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tukhē</span>\] on the occasion
of the shift \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">metabolē</span>\]
in favor of the Dorians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.2">

The people of Attica, reviving after the Peloponnesian war and the
plague, raised themselves again only to be struck down a few years later
by the ascendancy of Macedonia. From Macedonia the wrath of Alexander
swooped like a thunderbolt on Thebes of Boeotia. The Lacedaemonians
suffered injury through Epameinondas of Thebes and again through the war
with the Achaeans. And when painfully, like a shoot from a mutilated and
mostly withered trunk, the Achaean power sprang up, it was cut short,
while still growing, by the cowardice[^446] of its generals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.3">

At a later time, when the Roman imperial power devolved upon Nero, he
gave to the Roman people the very prosperous island of Sardinia in
exchange for Greece, and then bestowed upon the latter complete freedom.
When I considered this act of Nero it struck me how true is the remark
of Plato, the son of Ariston, who says that the greatest and most daring
crimes are committed, not by ordinary men, but by a noble soul ruined by
a perverted education.[^447]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.4">

The Greeks, however, were not to profit by the gift. For in the reign of
Vespasian, the next emperor after Nero, they became embroiled in a civil
war; Vespasian ordered that they should again pay tribute and be subject
to a governor, saying that the Greek people had forgotten how to be
free.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.5">

To resume after my researches into Achaean history. The boundary between
Achaea and Elis is the river Larisus, and by the river is a temple of
Larisaean Athena; about thirty stadium-lengths distant from the Larisus
is Dyme, an Achaean city. This was the only Achaean city that in his
wars Philip the son of Demetrios made subject to him, and for this
reason Sulpicius, another Roman governor, handed over Dyme to be sacked
by his soldiery. Afterwards Augustus annexed it to Patrai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.6">

Its more ancient name was Paleia, but the Ionians changed this to its
modern name while they still occupied the city; I am uncertain whether
they named it after Dyme, a native woman, or after Dymas, the son of
Aigimios. But nobody is likely to be led into a fallacy by the
inscription on the statue of Oibotas at Olympia. Oibotas was a man of
Dyme, who won the foot-race at the sixth Festival[^448] and was honored,
because of a Delphic oracle, with a statue erected in the eightieth
Olympiad.[^449] On it is an inscription which says:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.7">

“This Oibotas, an Achaean, the son of Oinias, by winning the foot-race,

</div>

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Added to the renown of his fatherland Paleia.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

This inscription should mislead nobody, although it calls the city
Paleia and not Dyme. For it is the custom of Greek poets to use ancient
names instead of more modern ones, just as they surname Amphiaraos and
Adrastos Phoronids, and Theseus an Erechthid.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.8">

A little before the city of Dyme there is, on the right of the road, the
tomb of Sostratos. He was a native youth, loved they say by Hēraklēs,
who outliving Sostratos made him his tomb and gave him some hair from
his head as a primal offering. Even today there is a slab on the top of
the mound, with a figure of Hēraklēs in relief. I was told that the
natives also sacrifice to Sostratos as to a hero.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.9">

The people of Dyme have a temple of Athena with an extremely ancient
image; they have as well a sanctuary built for the Dindymenian mother
and Attis. As to Attis, I could learn no secret
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aporrhēton</span>\] about
him,[^450] but Hermesianax, the elegiac poet, says in a poem that he was
the son of Galaos the Phrygian, and that he was a eunuch from birth. The
account of Hermesianax goes on to say that, on growing up, Attis
migrated to Lydia and celebrated for the Lydians the orgies of the
Mother; that he rose to such honor with her that Zeus, being angry at
it,[^451] sent a boar to destroy the tillage of the Lydians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.10">

Then certain Lydians, with Attis himself, were killed by the boar, and
it is consistent with this that the Gauls who inhabit Pessinus abstain
from pork. But the current view about Attis is different, the local
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrios</span>\] story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] about him being
this. Zeus, it is said, let fall in his sleep seed upon the ground,
which in course of time sent up a superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\], with two
sexual organs, male and female, who was called Agdistis. But the gods,
fearing[^452] Agdistis, cut off the male organ.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.11">

There grew up from it an almond tree with its fruit ripe, and a daughter
of the river Sangarios, they say, took of the fruit and put it in her
insides \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kolpos</span>\], when
it at once disappeared, but she was with child. A boy was born, and
exposed, but was tended by a he-goat. As he grew up his beauty was more
than human, and Agdistis fell in love with him. When he had grown up,
Attis was sent by his relatives to Pessinus, that he might wed the
king’s daughter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.12">

The marriage-song was being sung, when Agdistis appeared, and Attis went
mad and cut off his genitals, as also did he who was giving him his
daughter in marriage. But Agdistis repented of what he had done to
Attis, and persuaded Zeus to grant that the body of Attis should neither
rot at all nor decay.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.13">

These are the things that are best known about Attis. In the territory
of Dyme is also the tomb of Oibotas the runner. Although this Oibotas
was the first Achaean to win an Olympic victory, he yet received from
them no special prize. Wherefore Oibotas pronounced a curse that no
Achaean in future should win an Olympic victory. There must have been
some god who was careful that the curse of Oibotas should be fulfilled,
but the Achaeans by sending to Delphi at last learned why it was that
they had been failing to win the Olympic garland.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.17.14">

So they dedicated the statue of Oibotas at Olympia and honored him in
other ways, and then Sostratos of Pellene won the foot-race for boys. It
is still today a custom for the Achaeans who are going to compete at
Olympia to sacrifice to Oibotas as to a hero, and, if they are
successful, to place a wreath on the statue of Oibotas at Olympia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.1">

Some forty stadium-lengths from Dyme the river Peirus flows down into
the sea; on the Peirus once stood the Achaean city of Olenos. The poets
who have sung of Hēraklēs and his labors have found a favorite subject
in Dexamenos, king of Olenοs, and the entertainment Hēraklēs received at
his court. That Olenοs was from the beginning a small town I find
confirmed in an elegiac poem composed by Hermesianax about Eurytion the
Centaur. In course of time, it is said, the inhabitants, owing to their
weakness, left Olenus and migrated to Peiraiand Euryteiae.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.2">

About eighty stadium-lengths from the river Peiros is the city of
Patrai. Not far from Patrai the river Glaukos flows into the sea. Those
who memorialize
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmoneuein</span>\]
the-ancient-lore \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tà
arkhaia</span>\] of the people-of-Patrai
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Patreîs</span>\] say that it
was an aboriginal earthborn
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">autokhthōn</span>\], Eumēlos,
who first made-a-home
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in the land,
and that he was-king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileuein</span>\] of only a
few humans \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\].
But when Triptolemos came from Attica, he \[= Eumelos\] received from
him \[= Triptolemos\] cultivated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēmeros</span>\]
seed-for-harvesting
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">karpos</span>\], and, learning
how to establish
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikizein</span>\] a city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\], he named it
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aroē</span> from the ploughing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aroûn</span>\] of the land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.3">

It is said that Triptolemos once fell asleep, and that then Antheias,
the son of Eumēlos, yoked the dragons to the chariot
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harma</span>\] of Triptolemos
and tried to sow-seed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">speirein</span>\] himself. But
Antheias, undertaking the task, fell off the chariot and was killed, and
so Triptolemos and Eumēlos in common
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en koinōi</span>\] established
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikizein</span>\] a city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\], and called it
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Antheia</span> after the son of
Eumēlos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.4">

Between Antheia and Aroe was established
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikizein</span>\] a third city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\], called
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Mesátis</span>. As for all the
things that the people-of-Patrai \[Patreîs\] say about Dionysus, how he
was raised in Mesatis and incurred there all sorts of dangers
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kindunoi</span>\] through the
plots of the Titans, I will not contradict, but will leave it to the
people-of-Patrai \[Patreîs\] to explicate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ex(h)ēgeîsthai</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.5">

When, at a later point, the Achaeans had driven out the Ionians,
Patreus, the son of Preugenes, the son of Agenor, forbade the Achaeans
to settle in Antheia and Mesatis, but built at Aroe a wall
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">teikhos</span>\] of greater
circumference
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\] so as to
include Aroe within the enclosure
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\], and he
named the city \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\]
Patrai after himself. Agenor, the father of Preugenes, was the son of
Areus, the son of Ampyx, and Ampyx was a son of Pelias, the son of
Aiginetes, the son of Dereites, the son of Harpalos, the son of Amyklas,
the son of Lacedaemon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.6">

These were the ancestors of Patreus. With the passage of time the people
of Patrai by their own choice crossed into Aetolia; they did this out of
friendship for the Aetolians, to help them in their war with the Gauls,
and no other Achaeans joined them. But suffering unspeakable disasters
in the fighting, and most of them being also crushed by poverty, all
with the exception of a few left Patrai, and scattered, owing to their
love of agriculture, up and down the countryside, dwelling
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] in, besides
Patrai, the following municipalities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polismata</span>\]: Mesatis,
Antheia, Boline, Argyrâ, and Arba.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.7">

But Augustus, for some reason
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\], perhaps
because he thought that Patrai was a convenient port of call, brought
back again to Patrai the men
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andres</span>\] from the other
municipalities
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polismata</span>\], and he
consolidated-as-a-city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sunoikizein</span>\] not only
these populations but also
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pros</span>-\] the Achaeans
from Rhypai, which place he demolished all the way down to its
foundations. He granted that the people-of-Patrai \[Patreîs\] should be
free \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eleutheroi</span>\]. He
granted this only to them, of all the Achaeans. And he granted to them
also all the other privileges
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gera</span>\] that the Romans
have-the-custom-of bestowing on their colonists
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apoikoi</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.8">

On their acropolis the people of Patrai have a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Artemis
Laphria. The name
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">onoma</span>\] of the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\]
Laphria is not-native
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenikon</span>\], and her
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] was
brought in likewise from elsewhere. Here is why I say this. After
Calydon along with the rest of Aetolia had been depopulated by Augustus
the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span> \[‘king’\]
so that the Aetolian people might be incorporated
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sunoikizesthai</span>\] into
Nikopolis near Actium, the people of Patrai in this way got to have the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Laphria.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.9">

Most of the statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\] originating
from Aetolia and from Acarnania were brought
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] by order
of Augustus to Nikopolis, but to Patrai he gave, along with other
confiscated-things
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">laphura</span>\] from Calydon,
the statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of
Laphria, which even in my time was still receiving honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] on the
acropolis of Patrai. It is said that the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\] got
the surname \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\]
Laphria after a man from Phokis, because the ancient statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Artemis had
been set up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hidrusasthai</span>\] at
Calydon by Laphrios, the son of Kastalios, the son of Delphos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.10">

Others say that the anger
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēnīma</span>\] of Artemis
against Oineus, as time went on, weighed more lightly
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">elaphroteron</span>\] on the
Calydonians, and they wishfully-think
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ethelein</span>\] that this
was the reason \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\]
for the surname
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\] of the
goddess \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>
(feminine)\]. The pose
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skhēma</span>\] of the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is a Huntress
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thēreuousa</span>\]; it is
made \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] of ivory
and gold. Those who worked on it were Menaikhmos and Soidas, both from
Naupaktos, and both of these two, it is inferred-from-the-evidence
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tekmairesthai</span>\], lived
not much later than Kanakhos of Sikyon and Kallon of Aegina.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.11">

The people-of-Patrai \[Patreîs\] celebrate every year a festival
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] called
Laphria, which is likewise intended for their \[special kind of\]
Artemis, and, at this festival, there is a \[special\] way
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tropos</span>\] of sacrificing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\] that is
peculiar-to-the-locale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrios</span>\]. Around
the altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] in a
circle \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kuklos</span>\] they
set logs-of-wood \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xula</span>\]
still green \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khlōra</span>\],
each of them sixteen cubits in length. On the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] within the
circle \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kuklos</span>\] are
placed the driest of the logs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xula</span>\]. Just before the
right-time \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kairos</span>\] of
the festival \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\]
they create a smooth ascent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anodos</span> =
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-hodos</span>\] to the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\], piling earth
upon the ascending-steps
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anabasmoi</span>\] \[to form a
ramp\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.12">

The first thing that happens is the processing-of-a-procession
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pompēn pompeuein</span>\]—a
most magnificent
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">megaloprepestatē</span>\]
procession—for Artemis, and the girl
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\] who
officiates-as-priestess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierâsthai</span>\], coming up
last in \[the sequence of\] the procession
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pompē</span>\], rides
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">okheîtai</span>\] in a chariot
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">harma</span>\] yoked to deer.
It is, however, not till the next day—yes, this is the day—when they do
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\] the \[special\]
things that they have-the-custom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] of doing for
the sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\]—both the city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\],
by-way-of-its-public-support
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmosiāi</span>\], and no less
so the people, each-one-of-them-as-private-individuals
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">idiōtai</span>\],
being-ambitiously-aware-of-the-honor
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">philotīmōs ekhein</span>\]
with regard to the festival
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\]. Here is what
I mean. The people throw alive upon the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] edible birds
and all kinds of sacrificial-animals
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereîa</span>\] as well;
there are wild boars, deer, and gazelles; some even bring wolf-cubs or
bear-cubs, others bring the full-grown beasts. They also place upon the
altar \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] fruit
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">karpos</span>\] of cultivated
trees.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.18.13">

Next they set fire to the logs
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xula</span>\]. At this point I
saw \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theâsthai</span>\] some of
the animals, including a bear, trying to force-their-way
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">biazesthai</span>\] out, at
the first rush of the fire—some of them actually escaping by brute
force. But those who threw them in would drag them back again to the
pyre \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">purā</span>\]. It is not
remembered that anybody has ever been wounded by the animals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.1">

Between the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of \[Artemis\]
Laphria and the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] has been built
the tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of
Eurypylos. Before my narrative
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] about who he
was and for what reason
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aitiā</span>\] he came to this
land I will first tell about the existing state of affairs at the time
of his arrival. The Ionians who inhabited
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\] Aroe, Antheia,
and Mesatis had in-common \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en
koinōi</span>\] a precinct
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">temenos</span>\] and a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Artemis with
the surname \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\]
Triklaria, and for her the Ionians used to celebrate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] every year a
festival \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] and
an all-night-festivity
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pannukhis</span>\]. The
sacred-title-of-priest(ess)
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierōsunē</span>\] of the
goddess \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>
(feminine)\] was to be held by someone who was to be a virgin
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\] until the
time came for her to be sent to a husband.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.2">

Now they say that once upon a time it happened that the one who was
serving-as-priestess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hierâsthai</span>\] for the
goddess was Komaitho, a most-beautiful
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kallistē</span>\] virgin
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\].
Melanippos—that was his name—was-passionately-in-love
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erân</span>\] with her. He was
far better in good looks than others of his age. When Melanippos led the
girl \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\] to a
degree of passionate-love
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\] that reached the
point of being equal to his own
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">es tò ison</span>\], he
approached her father, seeking-permission-to-marry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnâsthai</span>\] her. Somehow
old age has a way of opposing the young in very many things, and, most
of all, it has a way of being insensitive-to-the-pain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-algēton</span>\] with
regard to those who are-passionately-in-love
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erân</span>\]. That is how it
was for Melanippos. Even though Komaitho was ready and willing to get
married off just as he was ready and willing to marry her, the response
he got even from his own parents, not only from the parents of Komaitho,
was anything but gentle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hēmeron</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.3">

The passionate-experiences
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pathēmata</span>\] of
Melanippos, like those of many others, gave-proof
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-deixai</span>\] that
passionate-love \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\]
has a way of confusing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-kheai</span>\] the
customary-laws \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomima</span>\]
of humans \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\]
and of turning-upside-down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-trepsai</span>\] the
acts-of-honor \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\]
that are due to the gods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\]. That is what
happened back then in this case as well. Right inside the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Artemis,
Komaitho and Melanippos had their fill of passionate-love
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erōs</span>\] in full swing.
And, after that, they even got into the habit of using the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] as a
bridal-chamber
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thalamos</span>\]. In due
time, the anger
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēnīma</span>\] of Artemis
began to destroy the humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\]. The earth
yielded no harvest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">karpos</span>\], and there
were diseases \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nosoi</span>\]
quite out of the ordinary, since they resulted in an unaccountable
number of deaths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.4">

The people appealed to the oracle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēstērion</span>\] at
Delphi, and the Pythian-priestess \[Puthia\] accused Melanippos and
Komaitho. The oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteuma</span>\], reaching
the people, ordered that they must sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] those two \[=
Melanippos and Komaitho\] to Artemis, and that every year \[thereafter\]
they must sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] to the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\]
whoever was the most beautiful girl
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\] and boy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pais</span>\]. Because of this
sacrifice \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\], the
river flowing by the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of \[Artemis\]
Triklaria was named Ameilikhos \[‘not-benign’\]. Previously it had no
name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.5">

None of the boys
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paides</span>\] and girls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénoi</span>\] who
perished because of Melanippos and Komaitho had done anything wrong
against the goddesss
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\], and
yet they still suffered
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paskhein</span>\] in a most
pitiful way, as did also those who were near-and-dear
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pros-(h)ēkontes</span>\] to
them, but those two \[= Melanippos and Komaitho\], I propose, escaped
from misfortune
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sumphorā</span>\]. I say this
because the only thing there is for a human
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpos</span>\] that is
worth one’s own life in exchange is this: achieving-success
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katorthōsai</span>\] in
loving-passionately
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">erân</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.6">

It is said that their practice of sacrificing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\] was put to
an end for them \[= the people of Patrai\] in the following way. Before
all this, there-had-been-an-oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsthai</span>\] for them
from Delphi, saying that a king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] who is alien
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenos</span>\] will come to
the land, bringing with him a superhuman-power
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] who is
likewise alien
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenikos</span>\], and that
this king will put an end to the things having to do with the sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\] to \[Artemis\]
Triklaria. When Troy \[Ilion\] was captured, and the Greeks divided the
spoils, Eurypylos the son of Euaimon got a chest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\]. In the chest
was a statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]
of Dionysus, the work
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\], so they say,
of Hephaistos, and given as a gift by Zeus to Dardanos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.7">

But there are two other narratives
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\] with regard to
this \[= the chest\]. One is that this chest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\] was left
behind by Aeneas when he fled \[from Troy\]; the other, that it was
thrown away by Cassandra to become a misfortune
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sumphorā</span>\] for the one
among the Greeks who finds it. Be that as it may, Eurypylos opened the
chest \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\], saw the
statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\], and,
right after the vision
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">théā</span>\], he went
out-of-his-mind
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ek-phrōn</span>\]. He went on
being-in-a-mental state
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mainesthai</span>\] for the
greater part of the time, though occasionally he would get back inside
himself. Being in this state, he did not proceed on his sea voyage to
Thessaly, but headed for Kirrha and the gulf there. Going uphill to
Delphi, he consulted-the-oracle
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrâsthai</span>\] about his
illness \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nosos</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.8">

They say that an oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteuma</span>\] was given to
him: at whatever place he finds humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\] who
are-sacrificing
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] a sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\] that is alien
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenē</span>\], at that place
he should set down the chest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\] and be-at-home
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikeîn</span>\]. Now the ships
of Eurypylos were carried down by the wind to the sea off Aroe. On
landing he came across a boy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pais</span>\] and a girl
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\] who had
just been brought to the altar
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bōmos</span>\] of \[Artemis\]
Triklaria. So Eurypylos found it easy to understand the things having to
do with the sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\], while the
local-people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\] got
themselves back to a remembrance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] of the oracular
pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsmos</span>\] now that
they saw a king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] whom they
had never seen before. And they suspected
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hupo-noeîn</span>\] that the
chest \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\] had some
god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] inside it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.9">

So it was, then, that the illness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nosos</span>\] of Eurypylos
and the things having to do with the sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thusiā</span>\] practiced by
these humans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anthrōpoi</span>\] came to an
end. Also, the river was now given its present name Meilikhos
\[‘benign’\]. Some have written, concerning the things I have just said,
that these things happened not to the Thessalian Eurypylos but to
Eurypylos the son of Dexamenos who was king in Olenos. They want to have
it the following way: that this one \[= the other Eurypylos\] joined
Hēraklēs in his campaign against Troy \[Ilion\] and received the chest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\] from Hēraklēs.
The rest of what they say corresponds to what I have said.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.19.10">

The thing is, though, that I cannot be persuaded to believe that
Hēraklēs did not know the things to be known about the chest, if these
things really were such as they were said to be, nor, if he was aware of
them, do I think that he would ever have given it to an ally as a gift.
Further, the people of Patrai have in their memory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\] no Eurypylos
other than the son of Euaimon, and to him every year they make-sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">enagizein</span>\] \[as to a
hero\] when they celebrate
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] the festival
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] in honor of
Dionysus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.1">

The surname \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\]
of the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]
inside the chest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\] is Aisymnetes
\[‘apportioner’\], and his chief attendants
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">therapeuontes</span>\] are
nine men, elected by the people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] on the basis of
their reputation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">axiōma</span>\], and there are
also \[attendants who are\] women, equal in number to the men. On one
night of the festival
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] the priest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereus</span>\]
carries-in-procession
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pherein</span>\] the chest
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">larnax</span>\], heading
outside. Now this is a special privilege
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">geras</span>\] assigned to
this night. Going-down
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kata-bainein</span>\] to the
river Meilikhos are a certain number of the local
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\]
boys-and-girls
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">paides</span>\], garlanded
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stephanoûsthai</span>\] with
garlands of wheat-ears
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">astakhues</span>\] on their
heads. It was in this way that they used to adorn
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kosmeîn</span>\] in the old
times those whom they were leading
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agein</span>\] \[in
procession\] so as to sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] them to
Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.2">

As for our own era, they lay-aside
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-tithenai</span>\] garlands
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stephanoi</span>\] of
wheat-ears \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">astakhues</span>\]
next to the goddess
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span> (feminine)\],
and, after bathing in the river and putting on garlands
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">stephanoi</span>\] all over
again, this time made of ivy
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kissos</span>\], they go to
the sanctuary \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\]
of the Aisymnetes \[= Dionysus\]. This then is the established way for
them to-do-the-ritual
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">drân</span>\], and within the
enclosure \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">peribolos</span>\]
of Laphria is a temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\] of Athena having
the surname \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epiklēsis</span>\]
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Pan-akhaiïs</span>. The statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is of ivory
and gold.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.3">

On the way to the lower city there is a sanctuary of the Dindymenian
Mother, and in it Attis too is worshipped. Of him they have no image to
show; that of the Mother is of stone. In the marketplace is a temple of
Olympian Zeus; the god himself is on a throne with Athena standing by
it. Beyond the Olympian is an image of Hērā and a sanctuary of Apollo.
The god is of bronze, and naked. On his feet are sandals, and one foot
stands upon the skull of an ox.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.4">

That Apollo takes great pleasure in oxen is shown by Alcaeus[^453] in
his hymn to Hermes, who writes how Hermes stole cows of Apollo, and even
before Alcaeus was born Homer made Apollo tend cows of Laomedon for a
wage. In the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> he puts
these verses in the mouth of Poseidon:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.5">

“Verily I built a wall for the Trojans about their city,

</div>

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

A wide wall and very beautiful, that the city might be impregnable;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And thou, Phoebus, didst tend the shambling cows with crumpled horns.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 21.446–448

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

This, it may be conjectured, is the reason for the ox skull. On the
marketplace, in the open, is an image of Athena with the tomb of Patreus
in front of it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.6">

Next to the marketplace is the Music Hall, where has been dedicated an
Apollo well worth seeing. It was made from the spoils taken when alone
of the Achaeans the people of Patrai helped the Aetolians against the
army of the Gauls. The Music Hall is in every way the finest in Greece,
except, of course, the one in Athens. This is unrivalled in size and
magnificence, and was built by Herodes, an Athenian,in memory of his
dead wife. The reason why I omitted to mention this Music Hall in my
history of Attica is that my account of the Athenians was finished
before Herodes began the building.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.7">

As you leave the marketplace of Patrai, where the sanctuary of Apollo
is, at this exit is a gate, upon which stand gilded statues, Patreus,
Preugenes, and Atherion; the two latter are represented as boys, because
Patreus is a boy in age. Opposite the marketplace by this exit is a
precinct and temple of Artemis, the Lady of the Lake.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.8">

When the Dorians were now in possession of Lacedaemon and Argos, it is
said that Preugenes, in obedience to a dream, stole from Sparta the
image of our Lady of the Lake, and that he had as partner in his exploit
the most devoted of his slaves. The image from Lacedaemon is usually
kept at Mesoa, because it was to this place that it was originally
brought by Preugenes. But when the festival of our Lady is being held,
one of the slaves of the goddess comes from Mesoa bringing the ancient
wooden image to the precinct in the city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.20.9">

Near this precinct the people of Patrai have other sanctuaries. These
are not in the open, but there is an entrance to them through the
porticoes. The image of Asklepios, save for the drapery, is of stone;
Athena is made of ivory and gold. Before the sanctuary of Athena is the
tomb of Preugenes. Every year they sacrifice to Preugenes as to a hero,
and likewise to Patreus also, when the festival of our Lady is being
held. Not far from the theater is a temple of Nemesis, and another of
Aphrodite. The images are colossal and of white marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.1">

In this part of the city is also a sanctuary of Dionysus surnamed
Calydonian, for the image of Dionysus too was brought from Calydon. When
Calydon was still inhabited, among the Calydonians who became priests of
the god was Koresos, who more than any other man suffered cruel wrongs
because of love. He was in love with Kallirhoe, a virgin. But the love
of Koresos for Kallirhoe was equalled by the maiden's hatred of him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.2">

When the maiden refused to change her mind, in spite of the many prayers
and promises of Koresos, he then went as a suppliant to the image of
Dionysus. The god listened to the prayer of his priest, and the
Calydonians at once became raving as though through drink, and they were
still out of their minds when death overtook them. So they appealed to
the oracle at Dodona. For the inhabitants of this part of the mainland,
the Aetolians and their neighbors in Akarnania and Epeiros, considered
that the truest oracles were the doves and the responses from the oak.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.3">

On this occasion the oracles from Dodona declared that it was the wrath
of Dionysus that caused the plague, which would not cease until Koresos
sacrificed to Dionysus either Kallirhoe herself or one who had the
courage to die in her stead. When the girl could find no means of
escape, she next appealed to her foster parents. These too failing her,
there was no other way except for her to be put to the sword.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.4">

When everything had been prepared for the sacrifice according to the
oracle from Dodona, the girl was led like a victim to the altar. Koresos
stood ready to sacrifice, when, his resentment giving way to love, he
slew himself in place of Kallirhoe. He thus proved in deed that his love
was more genuine than that of any other man we know.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.5">

When Kallirhoe saw Koresos lying dead, the girl repented. Overcome by
pity for Koresos, and by shame at her conduct towards him, she cut her
throat at the spring in Calydon not far from the harbor, and later
generations call the spring Kallirhoe after her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.6">

Near to the theater there is a precinct sacred to a native lady. Here
are images of Dionysus, equal in number to the ancient cities, and named
after them Mesateus, Antheus and Aroeus. These images at the festival of
Dionysus they bring into the sanctuary of \[Dionysus surnamed\] the
Aisymnetes. This sanctuary is on the right of the road from the
marketplace to the sea-quarter of the city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.7">

As you go lower down from the Dictator there is another sanctuary with
an image of stone. It is called the sanctuary of Recovery, and the story
is that it was originally founded by Eurypylos on being cured of his
madness. At the harbor is a temple of Poseidon with a standing image of
stone. Besides the names given by poets to Poseidon to adorn their
verses, and in addition to his local names, all men give him the
following surnames—Marine, Giver of Safety, God of Horses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.8">

Various reasons could be plausibly assigned for the last of these
surnames having been given to the god, but my own conjecture is that he
got this name as the inventor of horsemanship. Homer, at any rate, when
describing the chariot-race, puts into the mouth of Menelaos a challenge
to swear an oath by this god:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Touch the horses, and swear by the earth-holder, earth-shaker,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

That thou didst not intentionally, through guile, obstruct my chariot.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 23.584–585

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.9">

Pamphos also, who composed for the Athenians the most ancient of their
hymns, says that Poseidon is

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Giver of horses and of ships with sails set.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Pamphos, work unknown

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

So it is from horsemanship that he has acquired his name, and not for
any other reason.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.10">

In Patrai, not far from that of Poseidon, are sanctuaries of Aphrodite.
One of the two images was drawn up by fishermen in a net a generation
before my time. There are also quite near to the harbor two images of
bronze, one of Ares and the other of Poseidon. The image of Aphrodite,
whose precinct too is by the harbor, has its face, hands and feet of
stone, while the rest of the figure is made of wood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.11">

They have also a grove by the sea, affording in summer weather very
agreeable walks and a pleasant means generally of passing the time. In
this grove are also two temples of divinities, one of Apollo, the other
of Aphrodite. The images of these too are made of stone. Next to the
grove is a sanctuary of Demeter; she and her daughter are standing, but
the image of Earth is seated.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.12">

Before the sanctuary of Demeter is a spring. On the side of this towards
the temple stands a wall of stones, while on the outer side has been
made a descent to the spring. Here there is an infallible oracle, not
indeed for everything, but only in the case of sick folk. They tie a
mirror to a fine cord and let it down, judging the distance so that it
does not sink deep into the spring, but just far enough to touch the
water with its rim.[^454] Then they pray to the goddess and burn
incense, after which they look into the mirror, which shows them the
patient either alive or dead.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.13">

This water partakes to this extent of truth, but close to Cyaneae by
Lycia, where there is an oracle of Apollo Thyrxeus, the water shows to
him who looks into the spring all the things that he wants to behold. By
the grove in Patrai are also two sanctuaries of Serapis. In one is the
tomb of Aigyptos, the son of Belus. He is said by the people of Patrai
to have fled to Aroe because of the misfortunes of his children and
because he shuddered at the mere name of Argos, and even more through
dread of Danaos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.21.14">

There is also at Patrai a sanctuary of Asklepios. This sanctuary is
beyond the acropolis near the gate leading to Mesatis.The women of
Patrai outnumber the men by two to one. These women are amongst the most
charming in the world. Most of them gain a livelihood from the fine flax
that grows in Elis, weaving from it nets for the head as well as
dresses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.1">

Pharai, a city of the Achaeans, belongs to Patrai, having been given to
it by Augustus. The road from the city of Patrai to Pharai is a hundred
and fifty stadium-lengths, while Pharai is about seventy stadium-lengths
inland from the coast. Near to Pharai runs the river Pierus, which in my
opinion is the same as the one flowing past the ruins of Olenos, called
by the men of the coast the Peirus. Near the river is a grove of plane
trees, most of which are hollow through age, and so huge that they
actually feast in the holes, and those who have a mind to do so sleep
there as well.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.2">

The marketplace of Pharai is of wide extent after the ancient fashion,
and in the middle of it is an image of Hermes, made of stone and
bearded. Standing right on the earth, it is of square shape, and of no
great size. On it is an inscription, saying that it was dedicated by
Simylus the Messenian. It is called Hermes of the Market, and by it is
established an oracle. In front of the image is placed a hearth, which
also is of stone, and to the hearth bronze lamps are fastened with lead.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.3">

Coming at eventide, the inquirer of the god, having burned incense upon
the hearth, filled the lamps with oil and lighted them, puts on the
altar on the right of the image a local coin, called a “copper,” and
asks in the ear of the god the particular question he wishes to put to
him. After that he stops his ears and leaves the marketplace. On coming
outside he takes his hands from his ears, and whatever utterance he
hears he considers oracular.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.4">

There is a similar method of divination practiced at the sanctuary of
Apis in Egypt. At Pharai there is also a water sacred to Hermes. The
name of the spring is Hermes’ stream, and the fish in it are not caught,
being considered sacred to the god. Quite close to the image stand
square stones, about thirty in number. These the people of Pharai adore,
calling each by the name of some god. At a more remote period all the
Greeks alike worshipped uncarved stones instead of images of the gods.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.5">

About fifteen stadium-lengths from Pharai is a grove of the Dioskouroi.
The trees in it are chiefly laurels; I saw in it neither temple nor
images, the latter, according to the natives, having been carried away
to Rome. In the grove at Pharai is an altar of unshaped stones. I could
not discover whether the founder of Pharai was Phares, son of
Phylodameia, daughter of Danais, or someone else with the same name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.6">

Triteia, also a city of Achaea, is situated inland, but like Pharai
belongs to Patrai, having been annexed by the emperor. The distance to
Triteia from Pharai is a hundred and twenty stadium-lengths. Before you
enter the city is a tomb of white marble, well worth seeing, especially
for the paintings on the tomb, the work of Nikias. There is an ivory
chair on which is a young and beautiful woman, by whose side is a
handmaid carrying a sunshade. There is also a young man, who is
standing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.7">

He is too young for a beard, and wears a tunic with a purple cloak over
it. By his side is a servant carrying javelins and leading hounds. I
could not discover their names, but anyone can conjecture that here man
and wife share a common grave.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.8">

The founder of Triteia is said by some to have been Celbidas, who came
from Cumae in the country of the Opici. Others say that Ares mated with
Triteia the daughter of Triton, that this maiden was priestess to
Athena, and that Melanippos, the son of Ares and Triteia, founded the
city when he grew up, naming it after his mother.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.9">

In Triteia is a sanctuary of the gods called Almighty, and their images
are made of clay. In honor of these every year they celebrate a
festival, exactly the same sort of festival as the Greeks hold in honor
of Dionysus. There is also a temple of Athena, and the modern image is
of stone. The ancient image, as the folk of Triteia say, was carried to
Rome. The people here are accustomed to sacrifice both to Ares and to
Triteia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.10">

These cities are at some distance from the sea and completely inland. As
you sail to Aigion from Patrai you come first to the cape called Rhium,
fifty stadium-lengths from Patrai, the harbor of Panormos being fifteen
stadium-lengths farther from the cape. It is another fifteen
stadium-lengths from Panormos to what is known as the Fort of Athena.
From the Fort of Athena to the harbor of Erineus is a coastal voyage of
ninety stadium-lengths, and from Erineus to Aigion is sixty. But the
land route is about forty stadium-lengths less than the number here
given.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.22.11">

Not far from the city of Patrai is the river Meilikhos, and the
sanctuary of \[Artemis\] Triklaria, which no longer has an image. This
is on the right. Advancing from the Meilikhos you come to another river,
the name of which is the Kharadros. The flocks and herds that drink of
this river in spring are bound to have male young ones for the most
part, and for this reason the herdsmen remove all except the cows to
another part of the country. The cows they leave behind by the river,
because for sacrifices and for agriculture bulls are more suitable than
cows, but in the case of other cattle the females are preferred.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.1">

After the Kharadros you come to some ruins, not at all remarkable, of
the city Argyra, to the spring Argyra, on the right of the high road,
and to the river Selemnus going down to the sea. There is a tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] told by the
locals \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\]
about Selemnus—how he was a handsome boy who used to feed his flocks
here. Argyra, they say, was a sea-nymph, who fell in love with Selemnus
and used to come up out of the sea to visit him, sleeping by his side.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.2">

After no long while Selemnus no longer seemed so handsome, and the nymph
would not visit him. So Selemnus, deserted by Argyra, died of love, and
Aphrodite turned him into a river. I am saying here what the people of
Patrai say. Selemnus continued to love Argyra even when he was turned
into water, just as Alpheios, the story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] has it,
continued to love Arethousa. Aphrodite bestowed on him \[Selemnus\] a
further gift, by blotting out the memory of Argyra.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.3">

I heard too another tale about the water, how it is a useful remedy for
both men and women when in love; if they wash in the river they forget
their passion. If there is any truth in the story the water of the
Selemnus is of more value to mankind than great wealth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.4">

At some distance from Argyra is a river named Bolinaios, and by it once
stood a city Bolina. Apollo, it is said, fell in love with a maiden
called Bolina, who fleeing to the sea here threw herself into it, and by
the favor of Apollo became an immortal. Next to it a cape juts out into
the sea, and of it is told a story how Kronos threw into the sea here
the sickle with which he mutilated his father Uranus. For this reason
they call the cape Drepanum.[^455] Beyond the high road are the ruins of
Rhypes. Aigion is about thirty stadium-lengths distant from Rhypes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.5">

The territory of Aigion is crossed by a river Phoenix, and by another
called Meiganitas, both of which flow into the sea. A portico near the
city was made for Straton, an athlete who won at Olympia on the same day
victories in the pankration and in wrestling. The portico was built that
this man might exercise himself in it. At Aigion is an ancient sanctuary
of Eileithuia, and her image is covered from head to foot with
finely-woven drapery; it is of wood except the face, hands and feet,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.6">

which are made of Pentelic marble. One hand is stretched out straight;
the other holds up a torch. One might conjecture that torches are an
attribute of Eileithuia because the pangs of women are just like fire.
The torches might also be explained by the fact that it is Eileithuia
who brings children to the light. The image is a work of Damophon the
Messenian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.7">

Not far from Eileithuia is a precinct of Asklepios, with images of him
and of Hygieia. An iambic line on the pedestal says that the artist was
Damophon the Messenian. In this sanctuary of Asklepios a man of Sidon
entered upon an argument with me. He declared that the Phoenicians had
better notions about the gods than the Greeks, giving as an instance
that to Asklepios they assign Apollo as father, but no mortal woman as
his mother.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.8">

Asklepios, he went on, is air, bringing health to mankind and to all
animals likewise; Apollo is the sun, and most rightly is he named the
father of Asklepios, because the sun, by adapting his course to the
seasons, imparts to the air its healthfulness. I replied that I accepted
his statements, but that the argument was as much Greek as Phoenician
for at Titane in Sikyonia the same image is called both Hygieia and
…[^456] thus clearly showing that it is the course of the sun that
brings health to mankind.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.9">

At Aigion you find a temple of Athena and a grove of Hērā. Of Athena
there are two images of white marble; the image of Hērā may be seen by
nobody except the woman who happens to hold the office of priestess to
the goddess. Near the theater they have a sanctuary of Dionysus with an
image of the god as a beardless youth. There is also in the marketplace
a precinct of Zeus surnamed Savior, with two images, both of bronze, on
the left as you go in; the one without a beard seemed to me the more
ancient.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.10">

In a building right in front of the entrance are images, of bronze like
the others, representing Poseidon, Hēraklēs, Zeus and Athena. They are
called gods from Argos. The Argives say it is because they were made in
Argos; the people of Aigion themselves say that the images were
deposited by the Argives with them on trust.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.23.11">

They say further that they were ordered to sacrifice each day to the
images. But bethinking themselves of a trick they sacrificed a vast
number of animals, but the victims they ate up at public feasts, so that
they were not put to any expense. At last the Argives asked for the
images to be returned, whereupon the people of Aigion asked for the cost
of the sacrifices. As the Argives had not the means to pay, they left
the images at Aigion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.1">

By the marketplace at Aigion is a temple shared by Apollo and Artemis in
common; and in the marketplace there is a sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Artemis,
who is represented in the act of shooting an arrow, and also the tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] of Talthybios
the herald \[kērux<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">\].</span>
There is also at Sparta a barrow serving as a tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>\] of Talthybios,
which is heaped-up-as-a-tumulus
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kekhōstai</span>\], and both
cities sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">enagizein</span>\] to him \[as
to a hero\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.2">

By the sea at Aigion is a sanctuary of Aphrodite, and after it one of
Poseidon; there is also one of the Maiden, daughter of Demeter, and one
to Zeus Homagyrios (Assembler). Here are images of Zeus, of Aphrodite
and of Athena. The surname Assembler was given to Zeus because in this
place Agamemnon assembled the most eminent men in Greece, in order that
they might consult together how to make war on the empire of Priam.
Among the claims of Agamemnon to renown is that he destroyed Troy and
the cities around her[^457] with the forces that followed him
originally, without any later reinforcements.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.3">

Adjoining Zeus the Assembler is a sanctuary of Demeter Panachaean. The
beach, on which the people of Aigion have the sanctuaries I have
mentioned, affords a plentiful supply of water from a spring; it is
pleasing both to the eye and to the taste. They have also a sanctuary of
Safety. Her image may be seen by none but the priests, and the following
ritual is performed. They take cakes of the district from the goddess
and throw them into the sea, saying that they send them to Arethousa at
Syracuse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.4">

There are at Aigion other images made of bronze, Zeus as a boy and
Hēraklēs as a beardless youth, the work of Ageladas of Argos. Priests
are elected for them every year, and each of the two images remains at
the house of the priest. In a more remote age there was chosen to be
priest for Zeus from the boys he who won the prize for beauty. When his
beard began to grow the honor for beauty passed to another boy. Such
were the customs. Even in my time the Achaean assembly still meets at
Aigion, just as the Amphiktyones do at Thermopylae and at Delphi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.5">

Going on further you come to the river Selinous, and forty
stadium-lengths away from Aigion is a place on the sea called Helike.
Here used to be situated a city Helike, where the Ionians had a very
holy sanctuary of Heliconian Poseidon. Their worship of Heliconian
Poseidon has remained, even after their expulsion by the Achaeans to
Athens, and subsequently from Athens to the coasts of Asia. At Miletus
too on the way to the spring Biblis there is before the city an altar of
Heliconian Poseidon, and in Teos likewise the Heliconian has a precinct
and an altar, well worth seeing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.6">

There are also passages in Homer[^458] referring to Helike and the
Heliconian Poseidon. But later on the Achaeans of the place removed some
suppliants from the sanctuary and killed them. But the wrath of Poseidon
visited them without delay; an earthquake promptly struck their land and
swallowed up, without leaving a trace for posterity to see, both the
buildings and the very site on which the city stood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.7">

Warnings, usually the same in all cases, are accustomed to be sent by
the god before violent and far-reaching earthquakes. Either continuous
storms of rain or else continuous droughts occur before earthquakes for
an unusual length of time, and the weather is unseasonable. In winter it
turns too hot, and in summer along with a tendency to haze the orb of
the sun presents an unusual color, slightly inclining to red or else to
black.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.8">

Springs of water generally dry up; blasts of wind sometimes swoop upon
the land and overturn the trees; occasionally great flames dart across
the sky; the shapes of stars too appear such as have never been
witnessed before, producing consternation in those that witness them;
furthermore there is a violent rumbling of winds beneath the earth—these
and many other warnings is the god accustomed to send before violent
earthquakes occur.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.9">

The shock itself is not of one fixed type, but the original inquirers
into such matters and their pupils have been able to discover the
following forms of earthquake. The mildest form—that is, if such a
calamity admits of mitigation—is when there coincides with the original
shock, which levels the buildings with the ground, a shock in the
opposite direction, counteracting the first and raising up the buildings
already knocked over.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.10">

In this form of earthquake pillars may be seen righting themselves which
have been almost entirely uprooted, split walls coming together to their
original position; beams, dislocated by the shock, go back to their
places, and likewise channels, and such-like means of furthering the
flow of water, have their cracks cemented better than they could be by
human craftsmen. Now the second form of earthquake brings destruction to
anything liable to it, and it throws over at once, as it were by a
battering-ram, whatever meets the force of its impact.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.11">

The most destructive kind of earthquake the experts are accustomed to
liken to the symptoms of a man suffering from a non-intermittent fever,
the breathing of such a patient being rapid and labored. There are
symptoms of this to be found in many parts of the body, especially at
each wrist. In the same way, they say, the earthquake dives directly
under buildings and shakes up their foundations, just as molehills come
up from the bowels of the earth. It is this sort of shock alone that
leaves no trace on the ground that men ever dwelled there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.12">

This was the type of earthquake, they say, that on the occasion referred
to levelled Helike to the ground, and that it was accompanied by another
disaster in the season of winter. The sea flooded a great part of the
land, and covered up the whole of Helike all round. Moreover, the tide
was so deep in the grove of Poseidon that only the tops of the trees
remained visible. What with the sudden earthquake, and the invasion of
the sea that accompanied it, the tidal wave swallowed up Helike and
every man in it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.24.13">

A similar fate, though different in type,[^459] came upon a city on
Mount Sipylos, so that it vanished into a chasm. The mountain split,
water welled up from the fissure, and the chasm became a lake called
Saloe. The ruins of the city were to be seen in the lake, until the
water of the torrent hid them from view. The ruins of Helike too are
visible, but not so plainly now as they were once, because they are
corroded by the salt water.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.1">

The disaster that befell Helike is but one of the many proofs that the
wrath of the God of Suppliants is inexorable. The god at Dodona too
manifestly advises us to respect suppliants. For about the time of
Apheidas the Athenians received from Zeus of Dodona the following
verses:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Consider the Areiopagos, and the smoking altars

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Of the Eumenides, where the Lacedaemonians are to be thy suppliants,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When hard-pressed in war. Kill them not with the sword,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And wrong not suppliants. For suppliants are sacred and holy.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.2">

The Greeks were reminded of these words when Peloponnesians arrived in
Athens at the time when the Athenian king was Kodros, the son of
Melanthos. Now the rest of the Peloponnesian army, on learning of the
death of Kodros and of the manner of it, departed from Attica, the
oracle from Delphi making them despair of success in the future; but
certain Lacedaemonians, who got unnoticed within the walls in the night,
perceived at daybreak that their friends had gone, and when the
Athenians gathered against them, they took refuge in the Areiopagos at
the altars of the goddesses called August.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.3">

On this occasion the Athenians allowed the suppliants to go away
unharmed, but subsequently the magistrates themselves put to death the
suppliants of Athena, when Kylon and his supporters had seized the
Acropolis. So the slayers themselves and also their descendants were
regarded as accursed to the goddess. The Lacedaemonians too put to death
men who had taken refuge in the sanctuary of Poseidon at Taenarum.
Presently their city was shaken by an earthquake so continuous and
violent that no house in Lacedaemon could resist it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.4">

The destruction of Helike occurred while Asteios was still archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the fourth year of the hundred and first Olympiad,[^460] whereat Damon
of Thourioi was victorious for the first time. As none of the people of
Helike were left alive, the land is occupied by the people of Aigion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.5">

After Helike you will turn from the sea to the right and you will come
to the town of Ceryneia. It is built on a mountain above the high road,
and its name was given to it either by a native potentate or by the
river Cerynites, which, flowing from Arcadia and Mount Ceryneia, passes
through this part of Achaea. To this part came as settlers Mycenaeans
from Argolis because of a catastrophe. Though the Argives could not take
the wall of Mycenae by storm,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.6">

built as it was like the wall of Tiryns by the Cyclopes, as they are
called, yet the Mycenaeans were forced to leave their city through lack
of provisions. Some of them departed for Kleonai, but more than half of
the population took refuge with Alexander in Macedonia, to whom
Mardonios, the son of Gobryas, entrusted the message to be given to the
Athenians.[^461] The rest of the population came to Ceryneia, and the
addition of the Mycenaeans made Ceryneia more powerful, through the
increase of the population, and more renowned for the future.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.7">

In Ceryneia is a sanctuary of the Eumenides, which they say was
established by Orestes. Whosoever enters with the desire to see the
sights, if he be guilty of bloodshed, defilement or impiety, is said at
once to become insane with fright, and for this reason the right to
enter is not given to all and sundry. The images made of wood … they are
not very large in size, and at the entrance to the sanctuary are statues
of women, made of stone and of artistic workmanship. The natives said
that the women are portraits of the former priestesses of the Eumenides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.8">

On returning from Ceryneia to the high road, if you go along it for a
short distance you may turn aside again to Bura, which is situated on a
mountain to the right of the sea. It is said that the name was given to
the city from a woman called Bura, who was the daughter of Ion, son of
Xuthus, and of Helike. When the god wiped off Helike from the face of
the earth, Bura too suffered a severe earthquake, so that not even the
ancient images were left in the sanctuaries.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.9">

The only Burians to survive were those who chanced to be absent at the
time, either on active service or for some other reason, and these
became the second founders of Bura. There is a temple here of Demeter,
one of Aphrodite and Dionysus, and a third of Eileithuia. The images are
of Pentelic marble, and were made by Eukleides of Athens. There is
drapery for Demeter.[^462] Isis too has a sanctuary.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.10">

On descending from Bura towards the sea you come to a river called
Buraicus, and to a small Hēraklēs in a cave. He too is surnamed
Buraicus, and here one can divine by means of a tablet and dice. He who
inquires of the god offers up a prayer in front of the image, and after
the prayer he takes four dice, a plentiful supply of which are placed by
Hēraklēs, and throws them upon the table. For every figure made by the
dice there is an explanation expressly written on the tablet.[^463]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.11">

The straight road from Helike to the Hēraklēs is about thirty
stadium-lengths. Going on from the Hēraklēs you come to the mouth of a
river that descends from a mountain in Arcadia and never dries up. The
river itself is called the Crathis, which is also the name of the
mountain where the river has its source. From this Crathis the river too
by Kroton in Italy has been named.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.12">

By the Achaean Crathis once stood Aigai, a city of the Achaeans. In
course of time, it is said, it was abandoned because its people were
weak.[^464] This Aigai is mentioned by Homer in Hērā’s speech:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“They bring thee gifts up to Helike and to Aigai.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 8.203

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Hence it is plain that Poseidon was equally honored at Helike and at
Aigai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.25.13">

At no great distance from the Crathis you will find a tomb on the right
of the road, and on the tombstone a man standing by the side of a horse;
the colors of the painting have faded. From the tomb it is a journey of
about thirty stadium-lengths to what is called the Gaios, a sanctuary of
Earth surnamed Broad-bosomed, whose wooden image is one of the very
oldest. The woman who from time to time is priestess henceforth remains
chaste, and before her election must not have had intercourse with more
than one man. The test applied is drinking bull’s blood. Any woman who
may chance not to speak the truth is immediately punished as a result of
this test. If several women compete for the priesthood, lots are cast
for the honor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.1">

To the port of Aigeira, which has the same name as the city, it is
seventy-two stadium-lengths from the Hēraklēs that stands on the road to
Bura. The coast town of Aigeira presents nothing worth recording; from
the port to the upper city is twelve stadium-lengths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.2">

Homer in his poem calls the city Hyperesia.[^465] Its present name was
given it while the Ionians were still dwelling there, and the reason for
the name was as follows. A hostile army of Sikyonians was about to
invade their territory. As they thought themselves no match for the
Sikyonians, they collected all the goats they had in the country, and
gathering them together they tied torches to their horns, and when the
night was far advanced they set the torches alight.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.3">

The Sikyonians, suspecting that allies were coming to the help of the
Hyperesians, and that the flames came from their fires, set off home
again. The Hyperesians gave their city its present name of Aigeira from
the goats \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aiges</span>\], and
where the most beautiful goat, which led the others, crouched, they
built a sanctuary of Artemis the Huntress, believing that the trick
against the Sikyonians was an inspiration of Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.4">

The name Aigeira, however, did not supersede Hyperesia at once, just as
even in my time there were still some who called Oreus in Euboea by its
ancient name of Hestiaea. The sights of Aigeira worth recording include
a sanctuary of Zeus with a sitting image of Pentelic marble, the work of
Eukleides the Athenian. In this sanctuary there also stands an image of
Athena. The face, hands and feet are of ivory, the rest is of wood, with
ornamentation of gilded work and of colors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.5">

There is also a temple of Artemis, with an image of the modern style of
workmanship. The priestess is a virgin, who holds office until she
reaches the age to marry. There stands here too an ancient image, which
the folk of Aigeira say is Iphigeneia, the daughter of Agamemnon. If
they are correct, it is plain that the temple must have been built
originally for Iphigeneia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.6">

There is also a sanctuary of Apollo; the sanctuary itself, with the
sculptures on the pediments, are very old; the wooden image of the god
also is old, the figure being nude and of colossal size. None of the
inhabitants could give the name of the artist, but anyone who has
already seen the Hēraklēs at Sikyon would be led to conjecture that the
Apollo in Aigeira was also a work of the same artist, Laphaes the
Phliasian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.7">

There are in a temple standing images of Asklepios, and elsewhere images
of Serapis and of Isis, these too being of Pentelic marble. They worship
most devoutly the goddess they call the celestial one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ourania</span>\], but human
beings must not enter her sanctuary. But into the sanctuary of the
goddess they call Syrian they enter on stated days, but they must submit
beforehand to certain customary purifications, especially in the matter
of diet.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.8">

I remember observing at Aigeira a building in which was an image of
Fortune carrying the horn of Amaltheia. By her side is a winged Love,
the moral of which is that even success in love depends for mankind on
fortune rather than on beauty. Now I am in general agreement with
Pindar’s ode, and especially with his making Fortune one of the Fates,
and more powerful than her sisters.[^466]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.9">

In this building at Aigeira is also an old man in the attitude of a
mourner, three women taking off their bracelets, and likewise three
boys, with a man wearing a breastplate. They say that in a war of the
Achaeans this last man fought more bravely than any other soldier of
Aigeira, but was killed. His surviving brothers carried home the news of
his death, and therefore in mourning for him his sisters are discarding
their ornaments, and the natives call the father Sympathes, because even
in the statue he is a piteous figure.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.10">

There is a straight road from the sanctuary of Zeus at Aigeira, passing
through the mountains and steep. It is forty stadium-lengths long, and
leads to Phelloe, an obscure town, which was not always inhabited even
when the Ionians still occupied the land.[^467] The district round
Phelloe is well suited for the growth of the vine; the rocky parts are
covered with oaks, the home of deer and wild boars.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.11">

You may reckon Phelloe one of the towns in Greece best supplied with
flowing water. There are sanctuaries of Dionysus and of Artemis. The
goddess is of bronze, and is taking an arrow from her quiver. The image
of Dionysus is painted with vermilion. On going down from Aigeira to the
port, and walking on again, we see on the right of the road the
sanctuary of the Huntress, where they say the goat crouched.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.12">

The territory of Aigeira is bounded by that of Pellene, which is the
last city of Achaea in the direction of Sikyon and the Argolid. The city
got its name, according to the account of the Pellenians, from Pallas,
who was, they say, one of the Titans, but the Argives think it was from
Pellen, an Argive. And they say that he was the son of Phorbas, the son
of Triopas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.13">

Between Aigeira and Pellene once stood a town, subject to the Sikyonians
and called Donussa, which was laid waste by the Sikyonians;it is
mentioned, they say, in a verse of Homer that occurs in the list of
those who accompanied Agamemnon:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“And the men of Hyperesia and those of steep Donoessa.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 2.573

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

They go on to say that when Peisistratos collected the poems of Homer,
which were scattered and handed down by tradition, some in one place and
some in another, then either he or one of his colleagues perverted the
name through ignorance.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.26.14">

The port of Pellene is Aristonautae. Its distance from Aigeira on the
sea is one hundred and twenty stadium-lengths, and to Pellene from this
port is half that distance. They say that the name of Aristonautae[^468]
was given to that port because it was one of the habors into which the
Argonauts entered.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.1">

The city of Pellene is on a hill which rises to a sharp peak at its
summit. This part then is precipitous, and therefore uninhabited, but on
the lower slopes they have built their city, which is not continuous,
but divided into two parts by the peak that rises up between. As you go
to Pellene there is, by the roadside, an image of Hermes, who, in spite
of his surname of Crafty, is ready to fulfill the prayers of men. He is
of square shape and bearded, and on his head is carved a cap.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.2">

On the way to the city, close up to it, is a temple of Athena, built of
local stone, but the image is of ivory and gold. They say that Pheidias
made it before he made the images of Athena on the Athenian acropolis
and at Plataea. The people of Pellene also say that a shrine of Athena
sinks deep into the ground, that this shrine is under the pedestal of
the image, and that the air from the shrine is damp, and consequently
good for the ivory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.3">

Above the temple of Athena is a grove, surrounded by a wall, of Artemis
surnamed Savior, by whom they swear their most solemn oaths. No man may
enter the grove except the priests. These priests are natives, chosen
chiefly because of their high birth. Opposite the grove of the Savior is
a sanctuary of Dionysus surnamed Torch. In his honor they celebrate a
festival called the Feast of Torches, when they bring by night
firebrands into the sanctuary, and set up bowls of wine throughout the
whole city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.4">

There is also at Pellene a sanctuary of Apollo, the Strangers’ God, and
the image is made of bronze. They hold in honor of Apollo games that
they call Theoxenia, with money as the prizes of victory, the
competitors being the natives. Near the sanctuary of Apollo is a temple
of Artemis, the goddess being represented in the attitude of shooting.
In the marketplace is built a tank, and for bathing they use rain-water,
since for drinking there are a few springs beneath the city. The place
where the springs are they name Glyceiae (Sweet Springs).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.5">

There is an old gymnasium chiefly given up to the exercises of the
youths. No one may be enrolled on the register of citizens before he has
been on the register of youths. Here stands a man of Pellene called
Promakhos, the son of Dryon, who won prizes in the pankration, one at
Olympia, three at the Isthmus and two at Nemeā. The Pellenians made two
statues of him, dedicating one at Olympia and one in the gymnasium; the
latter is of stone, not bronze.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.6">

It is said too that when a war arose between Corinth and Pellene,
Promakhos killed a vast number of the enemy. It is said that he also
overcame at Olympia Poulydamas of Skotoussa, this being the occasion
when, after his safe return home from the king of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\], he came for
the second time to compete in the Olympic games. The Thessalians,
however, refuse to admit that Poulydamas was beaten; one of the pieces
of evidence they bring forward is a verse about Poulydamas:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Scotoessa, nurse of unbeaten Poulydamas.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Unknown

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.7">

Be this as it may, the people of Pellene hold Promakhos in the highest
honor. But Chaeron, who carried off two prizes for wrestling at the
Isthmian games and four at the Olympian, they will not even mention by
name. This I believe is because he overthrew the constitution of
Pellene, and received from Alexander, the son of Philip, the most
invidious of all gifts, to be set up as tyrant of one’s own fatherland.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.8">

Pellene has also a sanctuary of Eileithuia, which is situated in the
lesser portion of the city. What is called the Poseidium in more ancient
days was a township, but today it is uninhabited. This Poseidium is
below the gymnasium, and down to the present day it has been considered
sacred to Poseidon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.9">

About sixty stadium-lengths distant from Pellene is the Mysaeum, a
sanctuary of the Mysian Demeter. It is said that it was founded by
Mysios, a man of Argos, who according to Argive tradition gave Demeter a
welcome in his home. There is a grove in the Mysaeum, containing trees
of every kind, and in it rises a copious supply of water from springs.
Here they also celebrate a seven days’ festival in honor of Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.10">

On the third day of the festival the men withdraw from the sanctuary,
and the women are left to perform on that night the ritual that custom
demands. Not only men are excluded, but even male dogs. On the following
day the men come to the sanctuary, and the men and the women laugh and
jeer at one another in turn.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.11">

At no great distance from the Mysacum is a sanctuary of Asklepios,
called Cyrus, where cures of patients are effected by the god. Here too
there is a copious supply of water, and at the largest of the springs
stands the image of Asklepios. Rivers come down from the mountains above
Pellene, the one on the side nearest Aigeira being called Krios, after,
it is said, a Titan of the same name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:7.27.12">

There is another river called Krios, which rises in Mount Sipylos and is
a tributary of the Hermos. Where the territory of Pellene borders on
that of Sikyon is a Pellenian river Sythas, the last of the Achaean
rivers, which flows into the Sikyonian sea.

</div>

## Scroll VIII. Arcadia

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.1.1">

The part of Arcadia that lies next to the Argive land is occupied by
Tegeans and Mantineians, who with the rest of the Arcadians inhabit the
interior of the Peloponnesus. The first people within the peninsula are
the Corinthians, living on the Isthmus, and their neighbors on the side
sea-wards are the Epidaurians. Along Epidaurus, Troizen, and Nermion,
come the Argolic Gulf and the coast of Argolis; next to Argolis come the
vassals of Lacedaemon, and these border on Messenia, which comes down to
the sea at Mothone, Pylos and Cyparissiae.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.1.2">

On the side of Lechaeum the Corinthians are bounded by the Sikyonians,
who dwell in the extreme part of Argolis on this side. After Sikyon come
the Achaeans who live along the coast at the other end of the
Peloponnesus, opposite the Echinadian islands, dwell the Eleians. The
land of Elis, on the side of Olympia and the mouth of the Alpheios,
borders on Messenia; on the side of Achaea it borders on the land of
Dyme.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.1.3">

These that I have mentioned extend to the sea, but the Arcadians are
shut off from the sea on every side and dwell in the interior. Hence,
when they went to Troy, so Homer says, they did not sail in their own
ships, but in vessels lent by Agamemnon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.1.4">

The Arcadians say that Pelasgus was the first inhabitant of this land.
It is natural to suppose that others accompanied Pelasgus, and that he
was not by himself; for otherwise he would have been a king without any
subjects to rule over. However, in stature and in prowess, in beauty and
in wisdom, Pelasgus excelled his fellows, and for this reason, I think,
he was chosen to be king by them. Asios the poet says of him:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“The godlike Pelasgus on the wooded mountains

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Black earth gave up, that the lineage of mortals might exist.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Asios, unknown location

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.1.5">

Pelasgus on becoming king invented huts that humans should not shiver,
or be soaked by rain, or oppressed by heat. Moreover; he it was who
first thought of coats of sheep-skins, such as poor folk still wear in
Euboea and Phokis. He too it was who checked the habit of eating green
leaves, grasses, and roots always inedible and sometimes poisonous.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.1.6">

But he introduced as food the nuts of trees, not those of all trees but
only the acorns of the edible oak. Some people have followed this diet
so closely since the time of Pelasgus that even the Pythian priestess,
when she forbade the Lacedaemonians to touch the land of the Arcadians,
uttered the following verses:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“In Arcadia are many men who eat acorns,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Who will prevent you; though I do not grudge it you.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

It is said that it was in the reign of Pelasgus that the land was called
Pelasgia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.2.1">

Lycaon the son of Pelasgus devised the following plans, which were more
clever than those of his father. He founded the city Lycosura on Mount
Lykaios, gave to Zeus the surname Lykaios and founded the Lycaean games.
I hold that the Panathenian festival was not founded before the Lycaean.
The early name for the former festival was the Athenian, which was
changed to the Panathenian in the time of Theseus, because it was then
established by the whole Athenian people gathered together in a single
city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.2.2">

The Olympic games I leave out of the present account, because they are
traced back to a time earlier than humankind, the story being that
Kronos and Zeus wrestled there, and that the Kouretes were the first to
race at Olympia. My view is that Lycaon was contemporary with Kekrops,
the king of Athens, but that they were not equally wise in matters of
religion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.2.3">

For Kekrops was the first to name Zeus the Supreme god, and refused to
sacrifice anything that had life in it, but burned instead on the altar
the national cakes which the Athenians still call pelanoi. But Lycaon
brought a human baby to the altar of Lycaean Zeus, and sacrificed it,
pouring out its blood upon the altar, and, they say, immediately after
the sacrifice he was changed from a man to a wolf (Lycos).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.2.4">

I for my part am persuaded by this tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\]; it has been
told \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legesthai</span>\] among
the Arcadians from of old, and it has the additional merit of likelihood
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò eikós</span>\]. For the men
of those days, because of their righteousness and piety, were guests of
the gods, eating at the same board; the good were openly honored by the
gods, and sinners were openly visited with their wrath. Nay, in those
days men were changed to gods, who down to the present day have honors
paid to them—Aristaios, Britomartis of Crete, Hēraklēs the son of
Alkmene, Amphiaraos the son of Oikles, and besides these Polydeukes and
Castor (Kastor).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.2.5">

So one might believe that Lykaon was turned into a beast, and Niobe, the
daughter of Tantalos, into a stone. But at the present time, when sin
has grown to such a height and has been spreading over every land and
every city, no longer do men turn into gods, except in the flattering
words addressed to despots, and the wrath of the gods is reserved until
the sinners have departed to the next world.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.2.6">

All through the ages, many events that have occurred in the past, and
even some that occur today, have been generally discredited because of
the lies built up on a foundation of fact. It is said, for instance,
that ever since the time of Lykaon a man has changed into a wolf at the
sacrifice to Zeus Lykaios, but that the change is not for life; if, when
he is a wolf, he abstains from human flesh, after nine years he becomes
a man again, but if he tastes human flesh he remains a beast for ever.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.2.7">

Similarly too it is said that Niobe on Mount Sipylos sheds tears in the
season of summer. I have also heard that the griffins have spots like
the leopard, and that the Tritons speak with human voice, though others
say that they blow through a shell that has been bored. Those who like
to listen to the miraculous are themselves apt to add to the marvel, and
so they ruin truth by mixing it with falsehood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.3.1">

In the third generation after Pelasgus the land increased in the number
both of its cities and of its population. For Nyktimos, who was the
eldest son of Lykaon, possessed all the power, while the other sons
founded cities on the sites they considered best. Thus Pallantion was
founded by Pallas, Oresthasium by Orestheus and Phigalia by Phigalus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.3.2">

Pallantion is mentioned by Stesichorus of Himera in his
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Geryoneid</span>. Phigalia and
Oresthasium in course of time changed their names, Oresthasium to
Oresteium after Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, Phigalia to Phialia after
Phialus, the son of Bucolion. Cities were founded by Trapezeus also, and
by Daseatas, Makareus, Helisson, Acacus and Thocnus. The last founded
Thocnia, and Acacus Acacesium. It was after this Acacus, according to
the Arcadian account, that Homer[^469] made a surname for Hermes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.3.3">

Helisson has given a name to both the town and the river so called, and
similarly Makaria, Dasea, and Trapezus were named after the sons of
Lykaon. Orkhomenos became founder of both the town called Methydrium and
of Orkhomenos, styled by Homer[^470] “rich in sheep.” Hypsus and ...
[^471] founded Melainai and Hypsus, and also Thyraeum and Haimoniai. The
Arcadians are of opinion that both the Thyrea in Argolis and also the
Thyrean gulf were named after this Thyraios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.3.4">

Mainalos founded Mainalos, which was in ancient times the most famous of
the cities of Arcadia, Tegeates founded Tegea and Mantineus Mantineia.
Cromi was named after Cromus, Kharisia after Kharisios, its founder,
Trikolōnoi after Trokoloōnos, Peraitheis after Peraithos, Asea after
Aseatas, Lykoa after \[...\][^472] and Sumatia after Sumateus. Alipheros
also and Heraios both gave their names to cities.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.3.5">

But Oinotros, the youngest of the sons of Lykaon, asked his brother
Nyktimos for money and men and crossed by sea to Italy; the land of
Oinotria received its name from Oinotros who was its king. This was the
first expedition despatched from Greece to establish a colony, and if a
man makes the most careful calculation possible he will discover that no
barbarians either emigrated to another land before Oinotros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.3.6">

In addition to all this male issue, Lykaon had a daughter Kallisto. This
Kallisto—I am telling here the tales-told
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legomena</span>\] by the
Greeks—was loved by Zeus and mated with him. When Hērā detected the
intrigue she turned Kallisto into a bear, and Artemis to please Hērā
shot the bear. Zeus sent Hermes with orders to save the child that
Kallisto bore in her womb,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.3.7">

and Kallisto herself he turned into the constellation known as the Great
Bear, which is mentioned by Homer in the return voyage of Odysseus from
Calypso:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Gazing at the Pleiades and late-setting Bootes,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 5.272

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

But it may be that the constellation is merely named in honor of
Kallisto, since her tomb is pointed out by the Arcadians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.1">

After the death of Nyktimos, Arkas the son of Kallisto came to the
throne. He introduced the cultivation of crops, which he learned from
Triptolemos, and taught men to make bread, to weave clothes, and other
things besides, having learned the art of spinning from Adristas. After
this king the land was called Arcadia instead of Pelasgia and its
inhabitants Arcadians instead of Pelasgians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.2">

His wife, they said, was no mortal woman but a Dryad nymph. For they
used to call some nymphs Dryads, others Epimeliads, and others Naiads,
and Homer in his poetry talks mostly of Naiad nymphs. This nymph they
call Erato, and by her they say that Arkas had Azan, Apheidas and
Elatos. Previously he had had Autolaos, an illegitimate son.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.3">

When his sons grew up, Arkas divided the land between them into three
parts, and one district was named Azania after Azan; from Azania, it is
said, settled the colonists who dwell about the cave in Phrygia called
Steunos and the river Pencalas. To Apheidas fell Tegea and the land
adjoining, and for this reason poets too call Tegea “the lot of
Apheidas.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.4">

Elatos got Mount Cyllene, which down to that time had received no name.
Afterwards Elatos migrated to what is now called Phokis, helped the
people of Phokis when hard pressed in war by the Phlegyans, and became
the founder of the city Elateia. It is said that Azan had a son Kleitor,
Apheidas a son Aleus, and that Elatos had five sons, Aipytos, Pereus,
Cyllen, Ischys, and Stymphalos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.5">

On the death of Axan, the son of Arkas, athletic contests were held for
the first time; horse races were certainly held, but I cannot speak
positively about other contests. Now Kleitor the son of Azan dwelled in
Lykosoura, and was the most powerful of the kings, founding Kleitor,
which he named after himself; Aleus held his father’s portion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.6">

Of the sons of Elatos, Cyllen gave his name to Mount Cyllene, and
Stymphalos gave his to the spring and to the city Stymphalos near the
spring. The story of the death of Ischys, the son of Elatos, I have
already told in my history of Argolis.[^473] Pereus, they say, had no
male child, but only a daughter, Neaera. She married Autolycus
(Autolykos), who lived on Mount Parnassus, and was said to be a son of
Hermes, although his real father was Baedalion.

Kleitor, the son of Azan, had no children, and the sovereignty of the
Arcadians devolved upon Aipytos, the son of Elatos. While out hunting,
Aipytos was killed, not by any of the more powerful beasts, but by a
seps that he failed to notice. This species of snake I have myself seen.
It is like the smallest kind of adder, of the color of ash, with spots
dotted here and there. It has a broad head and a narrow neck, a large
belly and a short tail. This snake, like another called
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">cerastes</span> (“the horned
snake”), walks with a sidelong motion, as do crabs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.8">

After Aipytos Aleus came to the throne. For Agamedes and Gortys, the
sons of Stymphalos, were three generations removed from Arkas, and
Aleus, the son of Apheidas, two generations. Aleus built the old
sanctuary in Tegea of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aléā</span>, and made Tegea the
capital of his kingdom. Gortys the son of Stymphalos founded the city
Gortys on a river which is also called after him. The sons of Aleus were
Lycurgus (Lykourgos), Amphidamas and Cepheus; he also had a daughter
Auge.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.9">

Hecataeus says that this Auge used to have intercourse with Hēraklēs
when he came to Tegea. At last it was discovered that she had borne a
child to Hēraklēs, and Aleus, putting her with her infant son in a
chest, sent them out to sea. She came to Teuthras, lord of the plain of
the Kaïkos, who fell in love with her and married her. The tomb of Auge
still exists at Pergamon above the Kaïkos; it is a mound of earth
surrounded by a basement of stone and surmounted by a figure of a naked
woman in bronze.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.4.10">

After the death of Aleus Lycurgus (Lykourgos) his son got the kingdom as
being the eldest; he is notorious for killing, by treachery and riot in
fair fight, a warrior called Areithous. Of his two sons, Ankaios and
Epokhos, the latter fell ill and died, while the former joined the
expedition of Jason to Kolkhis; afterwards, while hunting down with
Meleagros the Calydonian boar, he was killed by the brute.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.1">

So Lycurgus (Lykourgos) outlived both his sons, and reached an extreme
old age. On his death, Ekhemos, son of Aeropus, son of Cepheus, son of
Aleus, became king of the Arcadians. In his time the Dorians, in their
attempt to return to the Peloponnesus under the leadership of Hyllos,
the son of Hēraklēs, were defeated by the Achaeans at the Isthmus of
Corinth, and Ekhemos killed Hyllos, who had challenged him to single
combat. I have come to the conclusion that this is a more probable story
than the one I gave before,[^474] that on this occasion Orestes was king
of the Achaeans, and that it was during his reign that Hyllos attempted
to return to the Peloponnesus. If the second account be accepted, it
would appear that Timandra, the daughter of Tyndareus, married Ekhemos,
who killed Hyllos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.2">

Agapenor, the son of Ankaios, the son of Lycurgus (Lykourgos), who was
king after Ekhemos, led the Arcadians to Troy. After the capture of Troy
the storm that overtook the Greeks on their return home carried Agapenor
and the Arcadian fleet to Cyprus, and so Agapenor became the founder of
Paphos, and built the sanctuary of Aphrodite at Palaipaphos (Old
Paphos). Up to that time the goddess had been worshipped by the Cyprians
in the district called Golgi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.3">

Afterwards Laodice, a descendant of Agapenor, sent to Tegea a robe as a
gift for Athena Aléā. The inscription on the offering told as well the
lineage of Laodice :

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“This is the robe of Laodice; she offered it to her Athena,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Sending it to her broad fatherland from divine Cyprus.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.4">

When Agapenor did not return home from Troy, the kingdom devolved upon
Hippothous, the son of Cercyon, the son of Agamedes, the son of
Stymphalos. No remarkable event is recorded of his life, except that he
established as the capital of his kingdom not Tegea but Trapezus.
Aipytos, the son of Hippothous, succeeded his father to the throne, and
Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, in obedience to an oracle of the Delphic
Apollo, moved his home from Mycenae to Arcadia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.5">

Aipytos, the son of Hippothous, dared to enter the sanctuary of Poseidon
at Mantineia, into which no mortal was, just as no mortal today is,
allowed to pass; on entering it he was struck blind, and shortly after
this calamity he died.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.6">

Aipytos was succeeded as king by his son Kypselos, and in his reign the
Dorian expedition returned to the Peloponnesus, not, as three
generations before, across the Corinthian Isthmus, but by sea to the
place called Rhium. Kypselos, learning about the expedition, married his
daughter to the son of Aristomakhos whom he found without a wife, and so
winning over Kresphontes he himself and the Arcadians had nothing at all
to fear.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.7">

Holaeas was the son of Kypselos, who, aided by the Herakleidai from
Lacedaemon and Argos, restored to Messene his sister’s son Aipytos.
Holaeas had a son Bucolion, and he a son Phialus, who robbed Phigalus,
the son of Lykaon, the founder of Phigalia, of the honor of giving his
name to the city; Phialus changed it to Phialia, after his own name, but
the change did not win universal acceptance.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.8">

In the reign of Simus, the son of Phialus, the people of Phigalia lost
by fire the ancient wooden image of Black Demeter. This loss proved to
be a sign that Simus himself also was soon to meet his end. Simus was
succeeded as king by Pompus his son, in whose reign the Aeginetans made
trading voyages as far as Cyllene, from which place they carried their
cargoes up country on pack-animals to the Arcadians. In return for this
Pompus honored the Arcadians greatly, and furthermore gave the name
Aiginetes to his son out of friendship for the Aeginetans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.9">

After Aiginetes his son Polymestor became king of the Arcadians, and it
was then that Kharillos and the Lacedaemonians for the first time
invaded the land of Tegea with an army. They were defeated in battle by
the people of Tegea, who, men and women alike, flew to arms; the whole
army, including Kharillos himself, were taken prisoners. Kharillos and
his army I shall mention at greater length in my account of Tegea.[^475]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.10">

Polymestor had no children, and Aechmis succeeded to the throne, who was
the son of Briacas, and the nephew of Polymestor. For Briacas too was a
son of Aiginetes, but younger than Polymestor. After Aechmis came to the
throne occurred the war between the Lacedaemonians and the Messenians.
The Arcadians had from the first been friendly to the Messenians, and on
this occasion they openly fought against the Lacedaemonians on the side
of Aristodemos, the king of Messenia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.11">

Aristocrates (Aristokrates), the son of Aechmis, may have been guilty of
outrages against the Arcadians of his most impious acts, however,
against the gods I have sure knowledge, and I will proceed to relate
them. There is a sanctuary of Artemis, surnamed Hymnia, standing on the
borders of Orkhomenos, near the territory of Mantineia. Artemis Hymnia
has been worshipped by all the Arcadians from the most remote period. At
that time the office of priestess to the goddess was still always held
by a girl who was a virgin.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.12">

The maiden persisted in resisting the advances of Aristocrates
(Aristokrates), but at last, when she had taken refuge in the sanctuary,
she was outraged by him near the image of Artemis. When the crime came
to be generally known, the Arcadians stoned the culprit, and also
changed the rule for the future; as priestess of Artemis they now
appoint, not a virgin, but a woman who has had enough of intercourse
with men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.5.13">

This man had a son Hicetas, and Hicetas had a son Aristocrates
(Aristokrates) the second, named after his grandfather and also meeting
with a death like his. For he too was stoned by the Arcadians, who
discovered that he had received bribes from Lacedaemon, and that the
Messenian disaster at the Great Ditch was caused by the treachery of
Aristocrates (Aristokrates). This sin explains why the kingship was
taken from the whole house of Kypselos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.6.1">

I spent much care upon the history of the Arcadian kings, and the
genealogy as given above was told me by the Arcadians themselves. Of
their memorable achievements the oldest is the Trojan war; then comes
the help they gave the Messenians in their struggle against Lacedaemon,
and they also took part in the action at Plataea against the
Persians.[^476]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.6.2">

It was compulsion rather than sympathy that made them join the
Lacedaemonians in their war against Athens and in crossing over to Asia
with Agesilaos;[^477] they also followed the Lacedaemonians to Leuktra
in Boeotia.[^478] Their distrust of the Lacedaemonians was shown on many
occasions; in particular, immediately after the Lacedaemonian reverse at
Leuktra they seceded from them and joined the Thebans. Though they did
not fight on the Greek side against Philip and the Macedonians at
Khaironeia,[^479] nor later in Thessaly against Antipatros, yet they did
not actually range themselves against the Greeks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.6.3">

It was because of the Lacedaemonians, they say, that they took no part
in resisting the Gallic threat to Thermopylae; they feared that their
land would be laid waste in the absence of their men of military age. As
members of the Achaean League the Arcadians were more enthusiastic than
any other Greeks. The fortunes of each individual city, as distinct from
those of the Arcadian people as a whole, I shall reserve for their
proper place in my narrative.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.6.4">

There is a pass into Arcadia on the Argive side in the direction of
Hysiaiand over Mount Parthenios into Tegean territory. There are two
others on the side of Mantineia: one through what is called Prinos and
one through the Ladder. The latter is the broader, and its descent had
steps that were once cut into it. Crossing the Ladder you come to a
place called Melangeia, from which the drinking water of the Mantineians
flows down to their city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.6.5">

Farther off from Melangeia, about seven stadium-lengths distant from
Mantineia, there is a well called the Well of the Meliasts. These
Meliasts celebrate the orgies of Dionysus. Near the well is a hall of
Dionysus and a sanctuary of Black Aphrodite. This surname of the goddess
is simply due to the fact that men do not, as the beasts do, have sexual
intercourse always by day, but in most cases by night.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.6.6">

The second road is less broad than the other, and leads over Mount
Artemisios. I have already made mention of this mountain,[^480] noting
that on it are a temple and image of Artemis, and also the springs of
the Inakhos. The river Inakhos, so long as it flows by the road across
the mountain, is the boundary between the territory of Argos and that of
Mantineia. But when it turns away from the road the stream flows through
Argolis from this point on, and for this reason Aeschylus among others
calls the Inakhos an Argive river.

</div>

{8.7.1.} After crossing into Mantineian country over Mount Artemisios
you will come to a plain called the Untilled Plain, whose name well
describes it, for the rainwater coming down into it from the mountains
prevents the plain from being tilled; nothing indeed could prevent it
from being a lake, were it not that the water disappears into a chasm in
the earth.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.7.2">

After disappearing here it rises again at Dine (Whirlpool). Dine is a
stream of fresh water rising out of the sea by what is called Genethlium
in Argolis. In olden times the Argives cast horses adorned with bridles
down into Dine as an offering to Poseidon. Not only here in Argolis, but
also by Kheimerion in Thesprotis, is there unmistakably fresh water
rising up in the sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.7.3">

A greater marvel still is the water that boils in the Maeander, which
comes partly from a rock surrounded by the stream, and partly rises from
the mud of the river. In front of Dicaearchia also, in the land of the
Etruscans, there is water boiling in the sea, and an artificial island
has been made through it, so that this water is not “untilled,”[^481]
but serves for hot baths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.7.4">

In the territory of the Mantineians on the left of the plain called
Untilled is a mountain, on which are the ruins of a camp of Philip, the
son of Amyntas, and of a village called Nestane. For it is said that by
this Nestane Philip made an encampment, and the spring here they still
call Philippium after the king. Philip came to Arcadia to bring over the
Arcadians to his side, and to separate them from the rest of the Greek
people.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.7.5">

Philip may be supposed to have accomplished exploits greater than those
of any Macedonian king who reigned either before or after. But nobody of
sound mind would call him a good general, for no man has so sinned by
continually trampling on oaths made to the gods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\], and by
breaking treaties and dishonoring his word on every occasion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.7.6">

The anger \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mēnima</span>\] that
comes from the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] was not late in
visiting him; never in fact have we known it more speedy. When he was
but forty-six years old, Philip fulfilled the oracle that it is said was
given him when he inquired of Delphi about the Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persēs</span>\]:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

The bull is garlanded; the consummation is at hand; the sacrificer is
ready.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Very soon afterwards events showed that this oracle pointed, not to the
Persians, but to Philip himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.7.7">

On the death of Philip, his infant son by Kleopatra, the niece of
Attalus, was along with his mother dragged by Olympias on to a bronze
vessel and burned to death. Afterwards Olympias killed Aridaios also. It
turned out that the god intended to mow down to destruction the lineage
of Kassandros as well. The sons of Kassandros were born to Thessalonikē,
the daughter of Philip, and both Thessalonikē and Aridaios had
Thessalian women for their mothers. The fate of Alexander is familiar to
everybody alike.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.7.8">

But if Philip had taken to heart the fate of the Spartan Glaukos,[^482]
and at each of his acts had bethought himself of the verse:[^483] “If a
man keeps his oath his family prospers hereafter,” then, I believe, some
god would not have extinguished so relentlessly the life of Alexander
and, at the same time, the Macedonian supremacy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.1">

So much by way of a digression. After the ruins of Nestane is a holy
sanctuary of Demeter, and every year the Mantineians hold a festival in
her honor. By Nestane there lies, on lower ground, about … itself too
forming part of the Untilled Plain, and it is called the Dancing Floor
of Maera. The road across the Untilled Plain is about ten
stadium-lengths. After crossing it you will descend, a little farther
on, into another plain. On it, alongside the highway, is a well called
Lamb.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.2">

The following story is told by the Arcadians. When Rhea had given birth
to Poseidon, she laid him in a flock for him to live there with the
lambs, and the spring too received its name just because the lambs
pastured around it. Rhea, it is said, declared to Kronos that she had
given birth to a horse, and gave him a foal to swallow instead of the
child, just as later she gave him in place of Zeus a stone wrapped up in
swaddling clothes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.3">

When I began my write-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sungraphē</span>\] I was
inclined to consider these stories
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\] of the Greeks
to be a case of simplemindedness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">euētheia</span>\], but on
getting as far as Arcadia I started to have a sense-of foresightfulness
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pronoia</span>\] about them,
which is this. In the days of old those Greeks who were considered wise
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sophoi</span>\] said what they
said not straight out but in riddles
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ainigmata</span>\], and so the
things that had been said about Kronos I started to consider a kind of
Greek wisdom \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sophiā</span>\].
When it comes to whatever is divine
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò theion</span>\], therefore,
I shall make use of the things that have been said.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.4">

The city of the Mantineians is about twelve stadium-lengths farther away
from this spring. Now there are plain indications that it was in another
place that Mantineus the son of Lykaon founded his city, which even
today is called Ptolis (City) by the Arcadians. From here, in obedience
to an oracle, Antinoe, the daughter of Cepheus, the son of Aleus,
removed the inhabitants to the modern site, accepting as a guide for the
pilgrimage a snake; the breed of snake is not recorded. It is for this
reason that the river, which flows by the modern city, has received the
name Ophis (Snake).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.5">

If we may base a conjecture on the verses of Homer, we are led to
believe that this snake was a dragon. When in the list of ships he tells
how the Greeks abandoned Philoctetes in Lemnos suffering from his wound,
he does not style the water-serpent a snake. But the dragon that the
eagle dropped among the Trojans he does call a snake. So it is likely
that Antinoe’s guide also was a dragon.[^484]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.6">

The Mantineians did not fight on the side of the other Arcadians against
the Lacedaemonians at Dipaea, but in the Peloponnesian war they rose
with the Eleians against the Lacedaemonians,[^485] and joined in battle
with them after the arrival of reinforcements from Athens. Their
friendship with the Athenians led them to take part also in the Sicilian
expedition.[^486]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.7">

Later on a Lacedaemonian army under Agesipolis, the son of Pausanias,
invaded their territory. Agesipolis was victorious in the battle and
shut up the Mantineians within their walls, capturing the city shortly
after. He did not take it by storm, but turned the river Ophis against
its fortifications, which were made of unburned brick.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.8">

Now against the blows of engines brick brings greater security than
fortifications built of stone. For stones break and are dislodged from
their fittings; brick, however, does not suffer so much from engines,
but it crumbles under the action of water just as wax is melted by the
sun.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.9">

This method of demolishing the fortifications of the Mantineians was not
discovered by Agesipolis. It was a stratagem invented at an earlier date
by Kimon, the son of Miltiades, when he was besieging Boges, a Mede, and
the other Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] who were
holding Eion on the Strymon.[^487] Agesipolis only copied an established
custom, and one celebrated among the Greeks. After taking Mantineia, he
left a small part of it inhabited, but by far the greater part he razed
to the ground, settling the inhabitants in villages.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.10">

Fate decreed that the Thebans should restore the Mantineians from the
villages to their own country after the engagement at Leuktra,[^488] but
when restored they proved far from grateful. They were caught treating
with the Lacedaemonians and intriguing for a peace with them privately
without reference to the rest of the Arcadian people. So through their
fear of the Thebans they openly changed sides and joined the
Lacedaemonian confederacy, and when the battle took place at Mantineia
between the Lacedaemonians and the Thebans under Epameinondas,[^489] the
Mantineians joined the ranks of the Lacedaemonians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.11">

Subsequently the Mantineians quarrelled with the Lacedaemonians, and
seceded from them to the Achaean League. They defeated Agis, the son of
Eudamidas, king of Sparta, in defence of their own country, with the
help of an Achaean army under the leadership of Aratos. They also joined
the Achaeans in their struggle against Kleomenes and helped to destroy
the Lacedaemonian power. Antigonos of Macedonia, who was guardian of
Philip, the father of Perseus, before he came of age, was an ardent
supporter of the Achaeans, and so the Mantineians, among other honors,
changed the name of their city to Antigoneia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.8.12">

Afterwards, when Augustus was about to fight the naval engagement off
the cape of Actian Apollo, the Mantineians fought on the side of the
Romans, while the rest of Arcadia joined the ranks of Antonius, for no
other reason, so it seems to me, except that the Lacedaemonians favored
the cause of Augustus. Ten generations afterwards, when Hadrian became
‘King’ \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileusai</span>\], he
took away from the Mantineians the name imported from Macedonia, and
gave back to their city its old name of Mantineia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.1">

The Mantineians possess a temple composed of two parts, being divided
almost exactly at the middle by a wall. In one part of the temple is an
image of Asklepios, made by Alkamenes; the other part is a sanctuary of
Leto and her children, and their images were made by Praxiteles two
generations after Alkamenes. On the pedestal of these are figures of
Muses together with Marsyas playing the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\].
Here there is a figure of Polybius, the son of Lykortas, carved in
relief upon a slab, of whom I shall make fuller mention later on.[^490]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.2">

The Mantineians have other sanctuaries also, one of Zeus Savior, and one
of Zeus Giver of Gifts, in that he gives good things to men. There is
also a sanctuary of the Dioskouroi, and in another place one of Demeter
and the Maiden. Here they keep a fire, taking anxious care not to let it
go out. Near the theater I saw a temple of Hērā.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.3">

Praxiteles made the images Hērā is sitting, while Athena and Hērā’s
daughter Hebe are standing by her side. Near the altar of Hērā is the
tomb of Arkas, the son of Kallisto. The bones of Arkas they brought from
Mainalos, in obedience to an oracle delivered to them from Delphi:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.4">

“Maenalia is storm-swept, where lies

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.5">

Not far from the theater are famous tombs, one called Common Hearth,
round in shape, where, they told me, lies Antinoe, the daughter of
Cepheus. On it stands a slab, on which is carved in relief a horseman,
Grylos, the son of Xenophon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.6">

Behind the theater I found the remains, with an image, of a temple of
Aphrodite surnamed Ally. The inscription on the pedestal announced that
the image was dedicated by Nicippe, the daughter of Paseas. This
sanctuary was made by the Mantineians to remind posterity of their
fighting on the side of the Romans at the battle of Actium. They also
worship Athena <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aléā</span>, of
whom they have a sanctuary and an image.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.7">

Antinous too was deified by them; his temple is the newest in Mantineia.
He was a great favorite of ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian. I
never saw him in the flesh, but I have seen images and pictures of him.
He has honors in other places also, and on the Nile is an Egyptian city
named after Antinous. He has won worship in Mantineia for the following
reason. Antinous was by birth from Bithynium beyond the river Sangarios,
and the Bithynians are by descent Arcadians of Mantineia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.8">

For this reason the Emperor established his worship in Mantineia also;
mystic rites are celebrated in his honor each year, and games every four
years. There is a building in the gymnasium of Mantineia containing
statues of Antinous, and remarkable for the stones with which it is
adorned, and especially so for its pictures. Most of them are portraits
of Antinous, who is made to look just like Dionysus. There is also a
copy here of the painting in the Cerameicus which represented the
engagement of the Athenians at Mantineia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.9">

In the marketplace is a bronze portrait-statue of a woman, said by the
Mantineians to be Diomeneia, the daughter of Arkas, and a hero-shrine of
Podares, who was killed, they say, in the battle with the Thebaus under
Epameinondas. Three generations ago they changed the inscription on the
tomb and made it apply to a descendant of this Podares with the same
name, who was born late enough to have Roman citizenship.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.9.10">

In my time the elder Podares was honored by the Mantineians, who said
that he who proved the bravest in the battle, of themselves and of their
allies, was Grylos, the son of Xenophon; next to Grylos was Kephisodoros
of Marathon, who at the time commanded the Athenian horse. The third
place for valor they give to Podares.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.1">

There are roads leading from Mantineia into the rest of Arcadia, and I
will go on to describe the most noteworthy objects on each of them. On
the left of the highway leading to Tegea there is, beside the walls of
Mantineia, a place where horses race, and not far from it is a
race-course, where they celebrate the games in honor of Antinous. Above
the race-course is Mount Alesium, so called from the wandering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ale</span>\] of Rhea, on which
is a grove of Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.2">

By the foot of the mountain is the sanctuary of Horse Poseidon, not more
than six stadium-lengths distant from Mantineia. About this sanctuary I,
like everyone else who has mentioned it, can write only what I have
heard. The modern sanctuary was built by ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian, who
set overseers over the workmen, so that nobody might look into the old
sanctuary, and none of the ruins be removed. He ordered them to build
around the new temple. Originally, they say, this sanctuary was built
for Poseidon by Agamedes and Trophonios,[^491] who worked oak logs and
fitted them together.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.3">

They set up no barrier at the entrance to prevent men going inside; but
they stretched across it a thread of wool. Perhaps they thought that
even this would strike fear into the religious people of that time, and
perhaps there was also some power in the thread. It is notorious that
even Aipytos, the son of Hippothous, entered the sanctuary neither by
jumping over the thread nor by slipping under it, but by cutting it
through. For this sin he was blinded by a wave that dashed on to his
eyes, and forthwith his life left him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.4">

There is an ancient story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] that a wave of
sea-water rises up in the sanctuary. A like story is told by the
Athenians about the wave on the Acropolis, and by the Carians living in
Mylasa about the sanctuary of the god called in the native tongue
Osogoa. But the sea at Phaleron is about twenty stadium-lengths distant
from Athens, and the port of Mylasa is eighty stadium-lengths from the
city. But at Mantineia the sea rises after a very long distance, and
quite plainly through the divine will.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.5">

Beyond the sanctuary of Poseidon is a trophy made of stone commemorating
the victory over the Lacedaemonians under Agis. The course of the battle
was, it is said, after this wise. The right wing was held by the
Mantineians themselves, who put into the field all of military age under
the command of Podares, the grandson of the Podares who fought against
the Thebans. They had with them also the Eleian seer Thrasyboulos, the
son of Aeneas, one of the Iamids. This man foretold a victory for the
Mantineians and took a personal part in the fighting.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.6">

On the left wing was stationed all the rest of the Arcadian army, each
city under its own leader, the contingent of Megalopolis being led by
Lydiades and Leokydes. The center was entrusted to Aratos, with the
Sikyonians and the Achaeans. The Lacedaemonians under Agis, who with the
royal staff officers were in the center, extended their line so as to
make it equal in length to that of their enemies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.7">

Aratos, acting on an arrangement with the Arcadians, fell back with his
command, as though the pressure of the Lacedaemonians was too severe. As
they gave way they gradually[^492] made their formation crescent-shaped.
The Lacedaemonians under Agis, thinking that victory was theirs, pressed
in close order yet harder on Aratos and his men. They were followed by
those on the wings, who thought it a great achievement to put to flight
Aratos and his host.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.8">

But the Arcadians got in their rear unperceived, and the Lacedaemonians
were surrounded, losing the greater part of their army, while King Agis
himself fell, the son of Eudamidas. The Mantineians affirmed that
Poseidon too manifested himself in their defence, and for this reason
they erected a trophy as an offering to Poseidon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.9">

That gods were present at war and slaughter of men has been told by the
poets who have treated of the sufferings of heroes at Troy, and the
Athenians relate in song how gods sided with them at Marathon and at the
battle of Salamis. Very plainly the host of the Gauls was destroyed at
Delphi by the god, and manifestly by demons. So there is precedent for
the story of the Mantineians that they won their victory by the aid of
Poseidon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.10.10">

Arkesilaos, an ancestor, ninth in descent, of Leokydes, who with
Lydiades was general of the Megalopolitans, is said by the Arcadians to
have seen, when dwelling in Lykosoura, the sacred deer, enfeebled with
age, of the goddess called Lady. This deer, they say, had a collar round
its neck, with writing on the collar:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“I was a fawn when captured, at the time when Agapenor went to Troy.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

This story proves that the deer is an animal much longer-lived even than
the elephant.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.1">

After the sanctuary of Poseidon you will come to a place full of oak
trees, called Sea, and the road from Mantineia to Tegea leads through
the oaks. The boundary between Mantineia and Tegea is the round altar on
the highroad. If you will turn aside to the left from the sanctuary of
Poseidon, you will reach, after going just about five stadium-lengths,
the tombs of the daughters of Pelias. These, the Mantineians say, came
to live with them when they were fleeing from the scandal at their
father’s death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.2">

Now when Medea reached Iolkos, she immediately began to plot against
Pelias; she was really conspiring with Jason, while pretending to be at
variance with him. She promised the daughters of Pelias that, if they
wished, she would restore his youth to their father, now a very old man.
Having butchered in some way a ram, she boiled his flesh with drugs in a
pot, by the aid of which she took out of the pot a live lamb.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.3">

So she took Pelias and cut him up to boil him, hut what the daughters
received was not enough to bury. This result forced the women to change
their home to Arcadia, and after their death mounds were made there for
their tombs. No poet, so far as I have read, has given them names, but
the painter Mikon inscribed on their portraits Asteropeia and Antinoe.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.4">

A Place called Phoezon is about twenty stadium-lengths distant from
these tombs. Phoezon is a tomb of stone surrounded with a basement,
raised only a little above the ground. At this point the road becomes
very narrow, and here, they say, is the tomb of Areithous, surnamed
Corynetes (Clubman) because of his weapon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.5">

As you go along the road leading from Mantineia to Pallantion, at a
distance of about thirty stadium-lengths, the highway is skirted by the
grove of what is called the Okeanos, and here the cavalry of the
Athenians and Mantineians fought against the Boeotian horse.
Epameinondas, the Mantineians say, was killed by Makhairion, a man of
Mantineia. The Lacedaemonians on their part say that a Spartan killed
Epameinondas, but they too give Makhairion as the name of the man.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.6">

The Athenian account, with which the Theban agrees, makes out that
Epameinondas was wounded by Grylos. Similar is the story on the picture
portraying the battle of Mantineia. All can see that the Mantineians
gave Grylos a public funeral and dedicated where he fell his likeness on
a slab in honor of the bravest of their allies. The Lacedaemonians also
speak of Makhairion as the slayer, but actually at Sparta there is no
Makhairion, nor is there at Mantineia, who has received honors for
bravery.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.7">

When Epameinondas was wounded, they carried him still living from the
ranks. For a while he kept his hand to the wound in agony, with his gaze
fixed on the combatants, the place from which he looked at them being
called Scope (Look) by posterity. But when the combat came to an
indecisive end, he took his hand away from the wound and died, being
buried on the spot where the armies met.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.8">

On the tomb stands a pillar, and on it is a shield with a dragon in
relief. The dragon means that Epameinondas belonged to the lineage of
those called the Spartoi, while there are slabs on the tomb, one old,
with a Boeotian inscription, the other dedicated by ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\]Hadrian, who
wrote the inscription on it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.9">

Everybody must praise Epameinondas for being the most famous Greek
general, or at least consider him second to none other. For the
Lacedaemonian and the Athenian leaders enjoyed the ancient reputation of
their cities, while their soldiers were men of a spirit, but the
Thebans, whom Epameinondas raised to the highest position, were a
disheartened people, accustomed to obey others.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.10">

Epameinondas had been told before by an oracle from Delphi to beware of
“ocean.” So he was afraid to step on board a man-of-war or to sail in a
merchant-ship, but by “ocean” the god indicated the grove “Okeanos” and
not the sea. Places with the same name misled Hannibal the Carthaginian,
and before him the Athenians also.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.11">

Hannibal received an oracle from Ammon that when he died he would be
buried in Libyan earth. So he hoped to destroy the Roman empire, to
return to his home in Libya, and there to die of old age. But when
Flamininus the Roman was anxious to take him alive, Hannibal came to
Prusias as a suppliant. Repulsed by Prusias he jumped upon his horse,
but was wounded in the finger by his drawn sword. when he had proceeded
only a few stadium-lengths his wound caused a fever, and he died on the
third day. The place where lie died is called Libyssa by the people of
Nikomedeia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.11.12">

The Athenians received an oracle from Dodona ordering them to colonize
Sicily, and Sicily is a small hill not far from Athens. But they, not
understanding the order, were persuaded to undertake expeditions
overseas, especially the Syracusan war. More examples could be found
similar to those I have given.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.1">

Just about a stadium-length from the tomb of Epameinondas is a sanctuary
of Zeus surnamed Kharmon. The oaks in the groves of the Arcadians are of
different sorts; some of them are called “broad-leaved,” others “edible
oaks.” A third kind have a porous bark, which is so light that they
actually make from it floats for anchors and nets. The bark of this oak
is called “cork” by the Ionians, for example by Hermesianax, the elegiac
poet.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.2">

From Mantineia there is a road leading to Methydrium, which today is not
a city, but only a village belonging to Megalopolis. Thirty
stadium-lengths farther is a plain called Alcimedon, and beyond the
plain is Mount Ostracina, in which is a cave where dwelled Alcimedon,
one of those called heroes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.3">

This man’s daughter, Phialo, had connection, say the Phigalians, with
Hēraklēs. When Alcimedon realized that she had a child, he exposed her
to perish on the mountain, and with her the baby boy she had borne, whom
the Arcadians call Aechmagoras. On being exposed the babe began to cry,
and a jay heard him wailing and began to imitate his cries.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.4">

It happened that Hēraklēs, passing along that road, heard the jay, and,
thinking that the crying was that of a baby and not of a bird, turned
straight to the voice. Recognizing Phialo he loosed her from her bonds
and saved the baby. Wherefore the spring hard by is named Cissa (Jay)
after the bird. Forty stadium-lengths distant from the spring is the
place called Petrosaca, which is the boundary between Megalopolis and
Mantineia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.5">

In addition to the roads mentioned there are two others, leading to
Orkhomenos. On one is what is called the stadium of Ladas, where Ladas
practiced his running, and by it a sanctuary of Artemis, and on the
right of the road is a high mound of earth. It is said to be the tomb of
Penelope, but the account of her in the poem called
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Thesprotis</span> is not in agreement
with this saying.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.6">

For in it the poet says that when Odysseus returned from Troy he had a
son Ptoliporthes by Penelope. But the Mantineian story about Penelope
says that Odysseus convicted her of bringing paramours to his home, and
being cast out by him she went away at first to Lacedaemon, but
afterwards she removed from Sparta to Mantineia, where she died.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.7">

Adjoining this tomb is a plain of no great size, and on the plain is a
mountain whereon still stand the ruins of old Mantineia. Today the place
is called Ptolis. Advancing a little way to the north of it you come to
the spring of Alalcomeneia, and thirty stadium-lengths from Ptolis are
the ruins of a village called Maera, with the tomb of Maera, if it be
really the case that Maera was buried here and not in Tegean land. For
probably the Tegeans, and not the Mantineians, are right when they say
that Maera, the daughter of Atlas, was buried in their land. Perhaps,
however, the Maera who came to the land of Mantineia was another, a
descendant of Maera, the daughter of Atlas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.8">

There still remains the road leading to Orkhomenos, on which are Mount
Anchisia and the tomb of Anchises at the foot of the mountain. For when
Aeneas was voyaging to Sicily, he put in with his ships to Laconia,
becoming the founder of the cities Aphrodisias and Etis; his father
Anchises for some reason or other came to this place and died there,
where Aeneas buried him. This mountain they call Anchisia after
Anchises.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.12.9">

The probability of this story is strengthened by the fact that the
Aeolians who today occupy Troy nowhere point out a tomb of Anchises in
their own land. Near the tomb of Anchises are the ruins of a sanctuary
of Aphrodite, and at Anchisiaiis the boundary between Mantineia and
Orkhomenos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.13.1">

In the territory of Orkhomenos, on the left of the road from Anchisiae,
there is on the slope of the mountain the sanctuary of Artemis Hymnia.
The Mantineians, too, share it … a priestess also and a priest. It is
the custom for these to live their whole lives in purity, not only
sexual but in all respects, and they neither wash nor spend their lives
as do ordinary people, nor do they enter the home of a private man. I
know that the “entertainers” of the Ephesian Artemis live in a similar
fashion, but for a year only, the Ephesians calling them Essenes. They
also hold an annual festival in honor of Artemis Hymnia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.13.2">

The former city of Orkhomenos was on the peak of a mountain, and there
still remain ruins of a marketplace and of walls. The modern, inhabited
city lies under the circuit of the old wall. Worth seeing here is a
spring, from which they draw water, and there are sanctuaries of
Poseidon and of Aphrodite, the images being of stone. Near the city is a
wooden image of Artemis. It is set in a large cedar tree, and after the
tree they call the goddess the Lady of the Cedar.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.13.3">

Beneath the city are heaps of stones at intervals, which were piled over
men who fell in war. With what Peloponnesians, whether Arcadians or
other, the war was fought, was set forth neither by inscriptions on the
tombs nor in Orkhomenian tradition.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.13.4">

Opposite the city is Mount Trakhu (Rough). The rain-water, flowing
through a deep gully between the city and Mount Trakhu, descends to
another Orkhomenian plain, which is very considerable in extent, but the
greater part of it is a lake. As you go out of Orkhomenos, after about
three stadium-lengths, the straight road leads you to the city Caphya,
along the side of the gully and afterwards along the water of the lake
on the left. The other road, after you have crossed the water flowing
through the gully, goes under Mount Trakhu.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.13.5">

On this road the first thing is the tomb of Aristocrates (Aristokrates),
who once outraged the virgin priestess of the goddess Hymnia, and after
the tomb of Aristocrates (Aristokrates) are springs called Teneiae, and
about seven stadium-lengths distant from the springs is a place Amilus,
which once, they say, was a city. Here the road forks again, one way
leading to Stymphalos, the other to Pheneus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.13.6">

On the road to Pheneus you will come to a mountain. On this mountain
meet the boundaries of Orkhomenos, Pheneus and Caphya. Over the
boundaries extends a high crag, called the Caphyatic Rock. After the
boundaries of the cities I have mentioned lies a ravine, and the road to
Pheneus leads through it. Just about the middle of the ravine water
rises up from a spring, and at the end of the ravine is a place called
Caryae.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.1">

The plain of Pheneus lies below Caryae, and they say that once the water
rose on it and flooded the ancient city of Pheneus, so that even today
there remain on the mountains marks up to which, it is said, the water
rose. Five stadium-lengths distant from Caryae is a mountain called
Oryxis, and another, Mount Sciathis. Under each mountain is a chasm that
receives the water from the plain.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.2">

These chasms according to the people of Pheneus are artificial, being
made by Hēraklēs when he lived in Pheneus with Laonome, the mother of
Amphitryo, who was, it is said, the son of Alkaios by Laonome, the
daughter of Guneus, a woman of Pheneus, and not by Lysidice, the
daughter of Pelops. Now if Hēraklēs really migrated to Pheneus, one
might believe that when expelled by Eurystheus from Tiryns he did not go
at once to Thebes, but went first to Pheneus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.3">

Hēraklēs dug a channel through the middle of the plain of Pheneus for
the river Olbios, which some Arcadians call, not Olbios but Aroanios.
The length of the cutting is fifty stadium-lengths, its depth, where it
has not fallen in, is as much as thirty feet. The river, however, no
longer flows along it, but it has gone back to its old bed, having left
the work of Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.4">

About fifty stadium-lengths from the chasms made in the mountains I have
mentioned is the city, founded, say the Pheneatians, by Pheneus, an
aboriginal. Their acropolis is precipitous on all sides, mostly so
naturally, but a few parts have been artificially strengthened, to make
it more secure. On the acropolis here is a temple of Athena surnamed
Tritonia, but of it I found ruins only remaining.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.5">

There stands also a bronze Poseidon, surnamed Horse, whose image, it is
said, was dedicated by Odysseus. It was said that Odysseus lost his
mares, traversed Greece in search of them, and on the site in the land
of Pheneus where he found his mares founded a sanctuary of Artemis,
calling the goddess Horse-finder, and also dedicated the image of Horse
Poseidon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.6">

When Odysseus found his mares he was minded, it is said, to keep horses
in the land of Pheneus, just as he reared his cows, they say, on the
mainland opposite Ithaca. On the base of the image the people of Pheneus
pointed out to me writing, purporting to be instructions of Odysseus to
those tending his mares.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.7">

The rest of the account of the people of Pheneus it will be reasonable
to accept, but I cannot believe their statement that Odysseus dedicated
the bronze image. For men had not yet learned how to make bronze images
in one piece, after the manner of those weaving a garment. Their method
of working bronze statues I have already described when speaking of the
image of Zeus Most High in my history of the Spartans.[^493]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.8">

The first men to melt bronze and to cast images were the Samians Rhoecus
the son of Philaios and Theodoros the son of Telekles. Theodoros also
made the emerald signet, which Polykrates, the tyrant of Samos,
constantly wore, being exceedingly proud of it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.9">

As you go down from the acropolis of Pheneus you come to a stadium, and
on a hill stands a tomb of Iphikles, the brother of Hēraklēs and the
father of Iolaos. Iolaos, according to the Greek account, shared most of
the labors of Hēraklēs, but his father Iphikles, in the first battle
fought by Hēraklēs against the Eleians and Augeias, was wounded by the
sons of Aktor, who were called after their mother Moline. In a fainting
condition he was carried by his relatives to Pheneus, where he was
carefully nursed by Bouphagos, a citizen of Pheneus, and by his wife
Promne, who also buried him when he died of his wound.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.10">

They still sacrifice to Iphikles as to a hero, and of the gods the
people of Pheneus worship most Hermes, in whose honor they celebrate the
games called Hermaea; they have also a temple of Hermes, and a stone
image, made by an Athenian, Eucheir the son of Eubulides. Behind the
temple is the tomb of Myrtilos. The Greeks say that he was the son of
Hermes, and that he served as charioteer to Oinomaos. Whenever a man
arrived to woo the daughter of Oinomaos, Myrtilos craftily drove on the
mares, while Oinomaos on the course shot down the wooer when he came
near.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.11">

Myrtilos himself, too, was in love with Hippodameia, but his courage
failing him he shrank from the competition and served Oinomaos as his
charioteer. At last, it is said, he proved a traitor to Oinomaos, being
induced thereto by an oath sworn by Pelops that he would let him be with
Hippodameia for one night. So when reminded of his oath Pelops threw him
out of the ship. The people of Pheneus say that the body of Myrtilos was
cast ashore by the tide, that they took it up and buried it, and that
every year they sacrifice to him by night as to a hero.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.14.12">

It is plain that Pelops did not make a long coasting voyage, but only
sailed from the mouth of the Alpheios to the harbor of Elis. So the Sea
of Myrto is obviously not named after Myrtilos, the son of Hermes, as it
begins at Euboea and reaches the Aegaean by way of the uninhabited
island of Helene. I think that a probable account is given by the
antiquarians of Euboea, who say that the sea is named after a woman
called Myrto.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.1">

The people of Pheneus have also a sanctuary of Demeter, surnamed
Eleusinian, and they perform a ritual to the goddess, saying that the
ceremonies at Eleusis are the same as those established among
themselves. For Naus, they assert, came to them because of an oracle
from Delphi, being a grandson of Eumolpos. Beside the sanctuary of the
Eleusinian has been set up Petroma, as it is called, consisting of two
large stones fitted one to the other.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.2">

When every other year they celebrate what they call the Greater Rites,
they open these stones. They take from out them writings that refer to
the rites, read them in the hearing of the initiated, and return them on
the same night. Most Pheneatians, too, I know, take an oath by the
Petroma in the most important affairs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.3">

On the top is a sphere, with a mask inside of Demeter Cidaria. This mask
is put on by the priest at the Greater Rites, who for some reason or
other beats with rods the Folk Underground. The Pheneatians have a story
that even before Naus arrived the wanderings of Demeter brought her to
their city also. To those Pheneatians who received her with hospitality
into their homes the goddess gave all sorts of pulse save the bean only.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.4">

There is a sacred story to explain why the bean in their eyes is an
impure kind of pulse. Those who, the Pheneatians say, gave the goddess a
welcome, Trisaules and Damithales, had a temple of Demeter Thesmia
(Law-goddess) built under Mount Cyllene, and they established for her
rites also, which they celebrate even to this day. This temple of the
goddess Thesmia is just about fifteen stadium-lengths away from the
city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.5">

As you go from Pheneus to Pellene and Aigeira, an Achaean city, after
about fifteen stadium-lengths you come to a temple of Pythian Apollo. I
found there only its ruins, which include a large altar of white marble.
Here even now the Pheneatians still sacrifice to Apollo and Artemis, and
they say that the sanctuary was made by Hēraklēs after capturing Elis.
Here also are tombs of heroes, those who joined the campaign of Hēraklēs
against Elis and lost their lives in the fighting.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.6">

They are Telamon, buried quite near the river Aroanios, a little farther
away than is the sanctuary of Apollo, and Chalcodon, not far from the
spring called Oinoe. Nobody could admit that there fell in this battle
the Chalcodon who was the father of the Elephenor who led the Euboeans
to Troy, and the Telamon who was the father of Ajax and Teukros. For how
could Hēraklēs have been helped in his task by a Chalcodon who,
according to trustworthy tradition, had before this been killed in
Thebes by Amphitryon?

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.7">

And how would Teukros have founded the city of Salamis in Cyprus if
nobody had expelled him from his native city after his return from Troy?
And who else would have driven him out except Telamon? So it is plain
that those who helped Hēraklēs in his campaign against Elis were not the
Chalcodon of Euboea and the Telamon of Aegina. It is, and always has
been, not unknown that undistinguished persons have had the same names
as distinguished heroes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.8">

The borders of Pheneus and Achaea meet in more places than one; for
towards Pellene the boundary is the river called Porinas, and towards
Aigeira the “road to Artemis.”[^494] Within the territory of the
Pheneatians themselves, shortly after passing the sanctuary of the
Pythian Apollo you will be on the road that leads to Mount Crathis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.15.9">

On this mountain is the source of the river Crathis, which flows into
the sea by the side of Aigai, now a deserted spot, though in earlier
days it was a city of the Achaeans. After this Crathis is named the
river in Bruttium in Italy. On Mount Crathis is a sanctuary of Artemis
Pyronia (Fire-goddess), and in more ancient days the Argives used to
bring from this goddess fire for their Lernaean ceremonies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.16.1">

Going east from Pheneus you come to a mountain peak called Geronteium
and a road by it. This mountain is the boundary between the territories
of Pheneus and Stymphalos. On the left of it, as you travel through the
land of Pheneus, are mountains of the Pheneatians called Trikrena (Three
Springs), and here are three springs. In them, it is said, Hermes was
washed after birth by the nymphs of the mountain, and for this reason
they are considered sacred to Hermes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.16.2">

Not far from Trikrena is another mountain called Sepia, where they say
that Aipytos, the son of Elatos, was killed by the snake, and they also
made his tomb on the spot, for they could not carry the body away. These
snakes are still to be found, the Arcadians say, on the mountain, even
at the present day; not many, however, for they are very scarce. The
reason is that, as for the greater part of the year snow falls on the
mountain, the snakes die that are cut off by the snow from their holes,
while should any make good their escape to the holes, nevertheless some
of them are killed by the snow, as the frost penetrates even into the
very holes themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.16.3">

The tomb of Aipytos I was especially anxious to see, because Homer[^495]
in his verses about the Arcadians makes mention of the tomb of Aipytos.
It is a mound of earth of no great size, surrounded by a circular base
of stone. Homer naturally was bound to admire it, as he had never seen a
more noteworthy tomb, just as he compares the dance worked by Hephaistos
on the shield of Achilles to a dance made by Daidalos, because he had
never seen more clever workmanship.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.16.4">

I know many wonderful tombs, and will mention two of them, the one at
Halicarnassus and one in the land of the Hebrews. The one at
Halicarnassus was made for Mausolus, king of the city, and it is of such
vast size, and so notable for all its ornament, that the Romans in their
great admiration of it call remarkable tombs in their country
“Mausolea.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.16.5">

The Hebrews have a tomb, that of Helen, a native woman, in the city of
Jerusalem, which the Roman Emperor razed to the ground. There is a
contrivance in the tomb whereby the door, which like all the tomb is of
stone, does not open until the year brings back the same day and the
same hour. Then the mechanism, unaided, opens the door, which, after a
short interval, shuts itself. This happens at that time, but should you
at any other try to open the door you cannot do so; force will not open
it, but only break it down.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.17.1">

After the tomb of Aipytos you come to the highest mountain in Arcadia,
Cyllene, on the top of which is a dilapidated temple of Cyllenian
Hermes. It is clear that Cyllen, the son of Elatos, gave the mountain
its name and the god his surname.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.17.2">

In days of old, men made wooden images, so far as I have been able to
discover, from the following trees ebony, cypress, cedar, oak, yew,
lotus. But the image of Cyllenian Hermes is made of none of these, but
of juniper wood. Its height, I conjecture, is about eight feet.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.17.3">

Cyllene can show also the following marvel. On it the blackbirds are
entirely white. The birds so called by the Boeotians are a somewhat
different breed, which does not sing. Eagles called swan-eagles, very
like to swans for whiteness, I am acquainted with, as I have seen them
on Mount Sipylos round the lake called the Lake of Tantalos. White wild
boars and Thracian white bears have been known to be acquired by private
individuals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.17.4">

White hares are bred in Libya, and white deer I have seen in Rome to my
great astonishment, though it never occurred to me to ask from what
continent or island they had been brought. I have made these few remarks
concerning the blackbirds in Cyllene that nobody may disbelieve what has
been said about their color.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.17.5">

Adjoining Cyllene is another mountain, Khelydorea,[^496] where Hermes is
said to have found a tortoise, taken the shell from the beast, and to
have made therefrom a harp. Here is the boundary between Pheneus and
Pellene, and the greater part of Mount Khelydorea is inhabited by the
Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.17.6">

As you go from Pheneus to the west, the left road leads to the city
Kleitor, while on the right is the road to Nonacris and the water of the
Styx. Of old Nonacris was a town of the Arcadians that was named after
the wife of Lykaon. When I visited it, it was in ruins, and most of
these were hidden. Not far from the ruins is a high cliff; I know of
none other that rises to so great a height. A water trickles down the
cliff, called by the Greeks the water of the Styx.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.18.1">

Hesiod in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Theogony</span>[^497]
—for there are some who assign this hexameter poem to Hesiod—speaks of
Styx as the daughter of Okeanos and the wife of Pallas. Men say that
Linos too gives a like account in his verses, though when I read these
they struck me as altogether spurious.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.18.2">

Epimenides of Crete, also, represented Styx as the daughter of Okeanos,
not, however, as the wife of Pallas, but as bearing Echidna to Peiras,
whoever Peiras may be. But it is Homer who introduces most frequently
the name of Styx into his poetry. In the oath of Hērā he says :

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Witness now to this be Earth, and broad Sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] above,

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 15.36–37

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

These verses suggest that the poet had seen the water of the Styx
trickling down. Again in the list of those who came with Guneus[^498] he
makes the river Titaresios receive its water from the Styx.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.18.3">

He also represents the Styx as a river in Hades, and Athena says that
Zeus does not remember that because of her he kept Hēraklēs safe
throughout the labors imposed by Eurystheus.

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The water trickling down the cliff by the side of Nonacris falls first
to a high rock, through which it passes and then descends into the river
Crathis. Its water brings death to all, man and beast alike. It is said
too that it once brought death even upon goats, which drank of the water
first; later on all the wonderful properties of the water were learned.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.18.5">

For glass, crystal, murrhine vessels, other articles men make of stone,
and pottery, are all broken by the water of the Styx, while things of
horn or of bone, with iron, bronze, lead, tin, silver and electrum, are
all corroded by this water. Gold too suffers just like all the other
metals, and yet gold is immune to rust, as the Lesbian poetess bears
witness and is shown by the metal itself.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.18.6">

So the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] has
assigned to the most lowly things the mastery over things far more
esteemed than they. For pearls are dissolved by vinegar, while diamonds,
the hardest of stones, are melted by the blood of the he-goat. The only
thing that can resist the water of the Styx is a horse’s hoof. When
poured into it the water is retained, and does not break up the hoof.
Whether Alexander, the son of Philip, met his end by this poison I do
not know for certain, but I do know that there is a story to this
effect.

Above Nonacris are the Aroanian Mountains, in which is a cave. To this
cave, it is said, the daughters of Proitos fled when struck with
madness; Melampos by secret sacrifices and purifications brought them
down to a place called Lusi. Most of the Aroanian mountain belongs to
Pheneus, but Lusi is on the borders of Kleitor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.18.8">

They say that Lusi was once a city, and Agesilas was proclaimed as a man
of Lusi when victor in the horse-race at the eleventh Pythian festival
held by the Amphiktyones;[^499] but when I was there not even ruins of
Lusi remained. Well, the daughters of Proitos were brought down by
Melampos to Lusi, and healed of their madness in a sanctuary of Artemis.
Wherefore[^500] this Artemis is called Hemerasia (She who soothes) by
the Clitorians \[people of Kleitor\].

There is a clan of the Arcadians, called the Cynaetheans, the same folk

up from a herd of cattle a bull, whichever one the god suggest to them,

Here there is a spring of cold water, about two stadium-lengths away
from the city, and above it grows a plane tree.

If a rabid dog turn a man mad, or wound or otherwise endanger him, to

man, while the spring among the Cynaetheans is a boon to make up for the
bane in the other place.

One of the roads from Pheneus, which go westward, remains, the one on
the left. This road leads to Kleitor, and extends by the side of the
work of Hēraklēs, which made a course for the river Aroanios. By it the

Pheneus and Kleitor.

Advancing about fifty stadium-lengths from Lykouria, you will come to
the source of the Ladon. I heard that the water making a lake in the
territory of Pheneus, descending into the chasms in the mountains, rises
here and forms the source of the Ladon, but I cannot say for certain
whether this is true or not. The Ladon is the most lovely river in
Greece, and is also famous for the tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] of Daphne, as
sung \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">āidomena</span>\] in

I pass over the story current among the Syrians who live on the river
Orontes, and give the account of the Arcadians and Eleians. Oinomaos,
prince of Pisa, had a son Leukippos. Leukippos fell in love with Daphne,
but despaired of winning her to be his wife by an open courtship, as she
avoided all the male sex. The following trick occurred to him by which
to get her. Leukippos was growing his hair long for the river Alpheios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.20.3">

Braiding his hair as though he were a girl, and putting on woman’s
clothes, he came to Daphne and said that he was a daughter of Oinomaos,
and would like to share her hunting. As he was thought to be a girl,
surpassed the other girls in nobility of birth and skill in hunting, and
was besides most assiduous in his attentions, he drew Daphne into a deep
friendship.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.20.4">

The poets who sing of Apollo’s love for Daphne make an addition to the
tale; that Apollo became jealous of Leukippos because of his success in
his love. Forthwith Daphne and the other girl conceived a longing to
swim in the Ladon, and stripped Leukippos in spite of his reluctance.
Then, seeing that he was not a girl, they killed him with their javelins
and daggers.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.21.1">

Such is the tale. From the source of the Ladon, Kleitor is sixty
stadium-lengths away, and the road from the source of the Ladon is a
narrow gorge alongside the river Aroanios. Near the city you will cross
the river called the Kleitor. The Kleitor flows into the Aroanios, at a
point not more than seven stadium-lengths from the city.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.21.2">

Among the fish in the Aroanios is one called the dappled fish. These
dappled fish, it is said, utter a cry like that of the thrush. I have

to cry most.

Kleitor got its name from the son of Azan, and is situated on a level
spot surrounded by low hills. The most celebrated sanctuaries of the
Clitorians \[people of Kleitor\] are those of Demeter, Asklepios and,
thirdly, Eileithuia … to be, and gave no number for them. The Lycian
Olen, an earlier poet, who composed for the Delians, among other hymns,
one to Eileithuia, styles her “the clever spinner,” clearly identifying
her with fate, and makes her older than Kronos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.21.4">

Kleitor has also, at a distance of about four stadium-lengths from the
city, a sanctuary of the Dioskouroi, under the name of the Great Gods.
There are also images of them in bronze. There is also built upon a

My narrative returns to Stymphalos and to Geronteium, as it is called,
the boundary between Stymphalos and Pheneus. The Stymphalians are no
longer included among the Arcadians, but are numbered with the Argive
League, which they joined of their own accord. That they are by lineage
Arcadians is testified by the verses of Homer,[^501] and Stymphalos
their founder was a grandson of Arkas, the son of Kallisto. It is said
that it was originally founded on another site, and not on that of the
modern city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.22.2">

The story has it that in the old Stymphalos dwelled Tēmenos, the son of
Pelasgos, and that Hērā was reared by this Tēmenos, who himself
established three sanctuaries for the goddess, and gave her three
surnames: when she was still a virgin
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">parthénos</span>\], Girl
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Pais</span>\]; when married to
Zeus he called her Adult
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Teleia</span>\] ; when for
some cause or other she quarrelled with Zeus and came back to
Stymphalos, Tēmenos named her Widow
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Khēra</span>\]. This is the
account which, to my own knowledge, the Stymphalians give of the
goddess.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.22.3">

The modern city contains none of these sanctuaries, but I found the
following notable things. In the Stymphalian territory is a spring, from
which ‘King’ \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\]
Hadrian brought water to Corinth. In winter the spring makes a small
lake in Stymphalos, and the river Stymphalos issues from the lake; in
summer there is no lake, but the river comes straight from the spring.
This river descends into a chasm in the earth, and reappearing once more
in Argolis it changes its name, and is called Erasinos instead of
Stymphalos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.22.4">

There is a story current about the water of the Stymphalos, that at one
time man-eating birds bred on it, which Hēraklēs is said to have shot
down. Peisandros of Camira, however, says that Hēraklēs did not kill the
birds, but drove them away with the noise of rattles. The Arabian desert
breeds among other wild creatures birds called Stymphalian, which are
quite as savage against men as lions or leopards.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.22.5">

These fly against those who come to hunt them, wounding and killing them
with their beaks. All armor of bronze or iron that men wear is pierced
by the birds; but if they weave a garment of thick cork, the beaks of
the Stymphalian birds are caught in the cork garment, just as the wings
of small birds stick in bird-lime. These birds are of the size of a
crane, and are like the ibis, but their beaks are more powerful, and not
crooked like that of the ibis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.22.6">

Whether the modern Arabian birds with the same name as the old Arcadian
birds are also of the same breed, I do not know. But if there have been
from all time Stymphalian birds, just as there have been hawks and
eagles, I should call these birds of Arabian origin, and a section of
them might have flown on some occasion to Arcadia and reached
Stymphalos. Originally they would be called by the Arabians, not
Stymphalian, but by another name. But the fame of Hēraklēs, and the
superiority of the Greek over the barbarian, has resulted in the birds
of the Arabian desert being called Stymphalian even in modern times.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.22.7">

In Stymphalos there is also an old sanctuary of Stymphalian Artemis, the
image being of wood, for the most part gilded. Near the roof of the
temple have been carved, among other things, the Stymphalian birds. Now
it was difficult to discern clearly whether the carving was in wood or
in gypsum, but such evidence as I had led me to conclude that it was not
of gypsum but of wood. There are here also maidens of white marble, with

Even in our own day the following miracle is said to have occurred. The
festival of Stymphalian Artemis at Stymphalos was carelessly celebrated,
and its established ritual in great part transgressed. Now a log fell
into the mouth of the chasm into which the river descends, and so
prevented the water from draining away, and (so it is said) the plain
became a lake for a distance of four hundred stadium-lengths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.22.9">

They also say that a hunter chased a deer, which fled and plunged into
the marsh, followed by the hunter, who, in the excitement of the hunt,
swam after the deer. So the chasm swallowed up both the deer and her
pursuer. They are said to have been followed by the water of the river,
so that by the next day the whole of the water was dried up that flooded
the Stymphalian plain. Hereafter they put greater zeal into the festival
in honor of Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.1">

After Stymphalos comes Aléā, which too belongs to the Argive federation,
and its citizens point to Aleus, the son of Apheidas, as their founder.
The sanctuaries of the gods here are those of Ephesian Artemis and
Athena Aléā, and there is a temple of Dionysus with an image. In honor
of Dionysus they celebrate every other year a festival called Sciereia,
and at this festival, in obedience to a response from Delphi, women are
flogged, just as the Spartan boys are flogged at the image of the
Orthian goddess.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.2">

In my account of Orkhomenos, I explained how the straight road runs at
first beside the gully, and afterwards to the left of the flood water.
On the plain of Caphyae has been made a dyke of earth, which prevents
the water from the Orkhomenian territory from doing harm to the tilled
land of Caphyae. Inside the dyke flows along another stream, in size big
enough to be called a river, and descending into a chasm of the earth it
rises again at Nasi, as it is called. The place where it reappears is
called Rheunus; the stream having risen here, hereafter the water forms
an ever-flowing river, the Tagus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.3">

The name of the city is clearly derived from Cepheus, the son of Aleus,
but its form in the Arcadian dialect, Caphyae, is the one that has
survived. The inhabitants say that originally they were from Attica, but
on being expelled from Athens by Aigeus they fled to Arcadia, threw
themselves on the mercy of Cepheus, and found a home in the country. The
town is on the border of the plain at the foot of some inconsiderable
mountains. The Caphyatans have a sanctuary of the god Poseidon, and one
of the goddess Artemis, surnamed Cnacalesia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.4">

They have also a mountain called Cnacalus, where every year they
celebrate mysteries in honor of their Artemis. A little beyond the city
is a spring, and by the spring grows a large and beautiful plane tree.
They call it Menelais, saying that the plane was planted by the spring
by Menelaos, who came to the spot when he was collecting his army
against Troy. Today they give the name Menelais to the spring as well as
to the plane.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.5">

If I am to base my calculations on the accounts of the Greeks in fixing
the relative ages of such trees as are still preserved and flourish, the
oldest of them is the withy growing in the Samian sanctuary of Hērā,
after which come the oak in Dodona, the olive on the Acropolis and the
olive in Delos. The third place in respect of age the Syrians would
assign to the bay tree they have in their country. Of the others this
plane tree is the oldest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.6">

About a stadium-length distant from Caphyae is a place called Condylea,
where there are a grove and a temple of Artemis called of old
Condyleatis. They say that the name of the goddess was changed for the
following reason. Some children, the number of whom is not recorded,
while playing about the sanctuary found a rope, and tying it round the
neck of the image said that Artemis was being strangled.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.7">

The Caphyans, detecting what the children had done, stoned them to
death. When they had done this, a malady befell their women, whose
babies were stillborn, until the Pythian priestess ordered them to bury
the children, and sacrifice to them every year as sacrifice is made to
heroes, because they had been wrongly put to death. The Caphyans still
obey this oracle, and call the goddess at Condyleae, as they say the
oracle also ordered them, the Strangled Lady from that day to this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.8">

Going up about seven stadium-lengths from Caphyae you will go down to
what is called Nasi. Fifty stadium-lengths farther on is the Ladon. You
will then cross the river and reach a grove called Soron, passing
through Argeathae, Lycuntes, as it is called, and Scotane. Now the road
to Psophis passes by way of Soron,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.23.9">

which, like other Arcadian groves, breeds the following beasts wild
boars, bears, and tortoises of vast size. One could of the last make
harps not inferior to those made from the Indian tortoise. At the end of
Soron are the ruins of the village Paus, and a little farther what is
called Seirai; this Seiraiforms a boundary between Kleitor and Psophis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.1">

The founder of Psophis, according to some, was Psophis, the son of
Arrhon, the son of Erymanthos, the son of Aristas, the son of Parthaon,
the son of Periphetes, the son of Nyktimos. Others say that Psophis was
the daughter of Xanthos, the son of Erymanthos, the son of Arkas. Such
are the Arcadian traditions concerning their kings,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.2">

but the most accurate version is that Eryx, the despot of Sicania, had a
daughter named Psophis, whom Hēraklēs, though he had intercourse with
her, refused to take to his home, but left with child in the care of his
friend Lykortas, who lived at Phegia, a city called Erymanthos before
the reign of Phegeus. Having been brought up here, Ekhephron and
Promakhos, the sons of Hēraklēs and the Sicanian woman, changed the name
of Phegia to Psophis, the name of their mother.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.3">

Psophis is also the name of the Zacynthian acropolis, because the first
man to sail across to the island was Zacynthus, the son of Dardanus, a
Psophidian who became its founder. From Seiraiit is thirty
stadium-lengths to Psophis, by the side of which runs the river
Aroanios, and a little farther away the river Erymanthos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.4">

The Erymanthos has its source in Mount Lampeia, which is said to be
sacred to Pan. One might regard Lampeia as a part of Mount Erymanthos.
Homer says[^502] that in Taygetos and Erymanthos … hunter … so … of
Lampeia, Erymanthos, and passing through Arcadia, with Mount Pholoe on
the right and the district of Thelpusa on the left, flows into the
Alpheios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.5">

It is also said that Hēraklēs at the command of Eurystheus hunted by the
side of the Erymanthos a boar that surpassed all others in size and in
strength. The people of Cumae among the Opici say that the boar’s tusks
dedicated in their sanctuary of Apollo are those of the Erymanthian
boar, but the saying is altogether improbable.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.6">

In Psophis there is a sanctuary of Aphrodite surnamed Erycine; I found
only ruins of it remaining, but the people said that it was established
by the sons of Psophis. Their account is probable, for in Sicily too, in
the territory of Eryx, is a sanctuary of Erycine, which from the
remotest times has been very holy, and quite as rich as the sanctuary in
Paphos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.7">

The hero-shrines, however, of Promakhos and Ekhephron, the sons of
Psophis, were no longer distinguished when I saw them. In Psophis is
buried Alkmaion also, the son of Amphiaraos, and his tomb is a building
remarkable for neither its size nor its ornament. About it grow
cypresses, reaching to such a height that even the mountain by Psophis
was overshadowed by them. These the inhabitants will not cut down,
holding them to be sacred to Alkmaion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.8">

They are called ‘Virgins’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Parthenoi</span>\] by the
natives. Alkmaion, after killing his mother, fled from Argos and came to
Psophis, which was still called Phegia after Phegeus, and married
Alphesiboea, the daughter of Phegeus. Among the presents that he
naturally gave her was the necklace. While he lived among the Arcadians
his disease did not grow any better, so he had recourse to the oracle at
Delphi. The Pythian priestess informed him that the only land into which
the avenging spirit of Eriphyle would not follow him was the newest
land, one brought up to light by the sea after the pollution of his
mother’s death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.9">

On discovering the alluvial deposit of the Akhelōos he settled there,
and took to wife Kallirhoe, said by the Acarnanians to have been the
daughter of Akhelōos. He had two sons, Acarnan and Amphoterus; after
this Acarnan were called by their present name (so the story runs) the
dwellers in this part of the mainland, who previously were called
Kouretes. Senseless passions shipwreck many men, and even more women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.10">

Kallirhoe conceived a passion for the necklace of Eriphyle, and for this
reason sent Alkmaion against his will to Phegia. Temenus and Axion, the
sons of Phegeus, murdered him by treachery. The sons of Phegeus are said
to have dedicated the necklace to the god in Delphi, and it is said that
the expedition of the Greeks to Troy took place when they were kings in
the city that was still called Phegia. The people of Psophis assert that
the reason why they took no part in the expedition was because their
princes had incurred the enmity of the leaders of the Argives, who were
in most cases related by blood to Alkmaion, and had joined him in his
campaign against Thebes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.11">

That the Echinades islands have not been made mainland as yet by the
Akhelōos is due to the Aetolian people, who have been driven from their
homes and all their land has been laid waste. Accordingly, as Aetolia
remains untilled, the Akhelōos does not bring as much mud upon the
Echinades as it otherwise would do. My reasoning is confirmed by the
fact that the Maeander, flowing through the land of the Phrygians and
Carians, which is ploughed up each year, has turned to mainland in a
short time the sea that once was between Priene and Miletus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.24.12">

The people of Psophis have also by the side of the Erymanthos a temple
and image of Erymanthos. The images of all rivers except the Nile in
Egypt are made of white marble; but the images of the Nile, became it
descends to the sea through Aethiopia, they are accustomed to make of
black stone.

The truth is that one man may receive fewer ills than his
contemporaries, just as one ship may be less tossed by storms than
another ship. But we shall not be able to find a man never touched by
misfortune or a ship never met by an unfavorable breeze. For Homer[^503]
too says in his poetry that by the side of Zeus is set a jar of good
things, and another jar of evil things, taught by the god at Delphi, who
once declared that Homer himself was both unhappy and blessed, being
destined by birth to both states alike.

(8.25.1} As you go from Psophis to Thelpusa you first reach on the left
of the Ladon a place called Tropaea, adjoining which is a grove,
Aphrodisium. Thirdly, there is ancient writing on a slab:

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

“The boundary between Psophis and Thelpusa.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

In the Thelpusian territory is a river called Arsen (Male). Cross this
and go on for about twenty-five stadium-lengths, when you will arrive at
the ruins of the village Caus, with a sanctuary of Causian Asklepios,
built on the road.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.2">

Thelpusa is some forty stadium-lengths distant from this sanctuary. It
is said that it was named after Thelpusa, a nymph, and that she was a
daughter of Ladon. The Ladon rises in springs within the territory of
Kleitor, as my account has already set forth. It flows first beside a
place Leucasium and Mesoboa, through Nasi to Oryx, also called Halus,
and from Halus it descends to Thaliades and a sanctuary of Eleusinian
Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.3">

This sanctuary is on the borders of Thelpusa. In it are images, each no
less than seven feet high, of Demeter, her daughter, and Dionysus, all
alike of stone. After the sanctuary of the Eleusinian goddess the Ladon
flows by the city Thelpusa on the left, situated on a high hill, in
modern times so deserted that the marketplace, which is at the extremity
of it, was originally, they say, right in the very middle of it.
Thelpusa has a temple of Asklepios and a sanctuary of the twelve gods;
the greater part of this, I found, lay level with the ground.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.4">

After Thelpusa the Ladon descends to the sanctuary of Demeter in
Onceium. The Thelpusians call the goddess Fury, and with them agrees
Antimakhos also, who wrote a poem about the expedition of the Argives
against Thebes. His verse runs thus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“There, they say, is the seat of Demeter Fury.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Antimakhos, unknown location

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Now Onkios was, according to tradition, a son of Apollo, and held sway
in Thelpusian territory around the place Oncium; the goddess has the
surname Fury for the following reason.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.5">

When Demeter was wandering in search of her daughter, she was followed,
it is said, by Poseidon, who lusted after her. So she turned, the story
runs, into a mare, and grazed with the mares of Onkios; realizing that
he was outwitted, Poseidon too changed into a stallion and enjoyed
Demeter.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.6">

At first, they say, Demeter was angry at what had happened, but later on
she laid aside her wrath and wished to bathe in the Ladon. So the
goddess has obtained two surnames, Fury because of her avenging anger,
because the Arcadians call being wrathful “being furious,” and Bather
(Lusia) because she bathed in the Ladon. The images in the temple are of
wood, but their faces, hands and feet are of Parian marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.7">

The image of Fury holds what is called the chest, and in her right hand
a torch; her height I conjecture to be nine feet. Lusia seemed to be six
feet high. Those who think the image to be Themis and not Demeter Lusia
are, I would have them know, mistaken in their opinion. Demeter, they
say, had by Poseidon a daughter, whose name they are not accustomed to
divulge to the uninitiated, and a horse called Areion. For this reason
they say that they were the first Arcadians to call Poseidon Horse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.8">

They quote verses from the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and from the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Thebaid</span> in confirmation of
their story. In the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>

Boy Asklepios, where is the tomb of Trygon, who is said to have been the

exposed in Thelpusa, but was found by Autolaos, the illegitimate son of
Arkas, who reared the baby, and for this reason Boy Asklepios … I

There is a river Tuthoa, and it falls into the Ladon at the boundary
between Thelpusa and Heraia, called Plain by the Arcadians. Where the
Ladon itself falls into the Alpheios is an island called the Island of
Crows. Those who have thought that Enispe, Stratia and Rhipe, mentioned
by Homer,[^505] were once inhabited islands in the Ladon, cherish, I
would tell them, a false belief.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.25.13">

For the Ladon could never show islands even as large as a ferry-boat. As
far as beauty is concerned, it is second to no river, either in Greece
or in barbarian lands, but it is not big enough to carry islands on its
waters, as do the Danube and the Eridanos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.26.1">

The founder of Heraia was Heraeeus the son of Lykaon, and the city lies
on the right of the Alpheios, mostly upon a gentle slope, though a part
descends right to the Alpheios. Walks have been made along the river,
separated by myrtles and other cultivated trees; the baths are there, as
are also two temples to Dionysus. One is to the god named Citizen, the
other to the Giver of Increase, and they have a building there where
they celebrate their mysteries in honor of Dionysus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.26.2">

There is also in Heraia a temple of Pan, as he is native to Arcadia, and
of the temple of Hērā I found remaining various ruins, including the
pillars. Of Arcadian athletes the most renowned has been Damaretos of
Heraia, who was the first to win the race in armor at Olympia.

As you go down to the land of Elis from Heraia, at a distance of about
fifteen stadium-lengths from Heraia you will cross the Ladon, and from
it to the Erymanthos is a journey of roughly twenty stadium-lengths. The
boundary between Heraia and the land of Elis is according to the
Arcadians the Erymanthos, but the people of Elis say that the tomb of
Coroebus bounds their territory.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.26.4">

But when the Olympic games, after not being held for a long period, were

his tomb was made at the end of Eleian territory.

There is a town, Aliphera, of no great size, for it was abandoned by
many of its inhabitants at the union of the Arcadians into Megalopolis.
As you go to this town from Heraia you will cross the Alpheios, and
after going over a plain of just about ten stadium-lengths you will
reach a mountain, and ascending across the mountain for some thirty
stadium-lengths more you will come to the town.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.26.6">

The city of Aliphera has received its name from Alipherus, the son of
Lykaon, and there are sanctuaries here of Asklepios and Athena; the
latter they worship more than any other god, saying that she was born
and bred among them. They also set up an altar of Zeus Lekheates (In
child-bed), because here he gave birth to Athena. There is a stream they
call Tritonis, adopting the story about the river Triton.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.26.7">

The image of Athena is made of bronze, the work of Hypatodoros, worth
seeing for its size and workmanship. They keep a general festival in
honor of some god or other; I think in honor of Athena. At this festival
they sacrifice first to Fly-catcher, praying to the hero over the
victims and calling upon the Fly-catcher. When they have done this the
flies trouble them no longer.

On the road from Heraia to Megalopolis is Melainai. It was founded by
Melaineus, the son of Lykaon; in my time it was uninhabited, but there
is plenty of water flowing over it. Forty stadium-lengths above Melainai
is Bouphagion,and here is the source of the Bouphagos, which flows down
into the Alpheios. Near the source of the Bouphagos is the boundary
between Megalopolis and Heraia.

Megalopolis is the youngest city, not of Arcadia only, but of Greece,
with the exception of those whose inhabitants have been removed by the
accident of the Roman domination. The Arcadians united into it to gain
strength, realizing that the Argives also were in earlier times in
almost daily danger of being subjected by war to the Lacedaemonians, but
when they had increased the population of Argos by reducing Tiryns,
Hysiae, Orneae, Mycenae, Mideia, along with other towns of little
importance in Argolis, the Argives had less to fear from the
Lacedaemonians, while they were in a stronger position to deal with
their vassal neighbors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.2">

It was with this policy in view that the Arcadians united, and the
founder of the city might fairly be considered Epameinondas of Thebes.
For lie it was who gathered the Arcadians together for the union and
despatched a thousand picked Thebans under Pammenes to defend the
Arcadians, if the Lacedaemonians should try to prevent the union. There
were chosen as founders by the Arcadians, Lykomedes and Hopoleas of
Mantineia, Timon and Proxenos of Tegea, Kleolaos and Akriphios of
Kleitor, Eucampidas and Hieronymos of Mainalos, Possikrates and
Theoxenos of the Parrhasians.

The following were the cities which the Arcadians were persuaded to

Lacedaemonians, in spite of the fact that these cities were their homes:
Aléā, Pallantion, Eutaea, Sumateium, Asea, Peraethenses, Helisson,
Oresthasium, Dipaea, Lykaia; these were cities of Mainalos. Of the
Eutresian cities Tricoloni, Zoetium, Kharisia, Ptolederma, Cnausum,
Paroreia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.4">

From the Aigytai: Aigys, Scirtonium, Malea, Cromi, Blenina, Leuctrum. Of
the Parrhasians Lykosoura, Thocnia, Trapezus, Prosenses, Acacesium,
Acontium, Makaria, Dasea. Of the Cynurians in Arcadia: Gortys, Theisoa
by Mount Lykaios, Lykaia, Aliphera. Of those belonging to Orkhomenos:
Theisoa, Methydrium, Teuthis. These were joined by Tripolis, as it is
called, Kallia, Dipoena, Nonacris.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.5">

The Arcadians for the most part obeyed the general resolution and
assembled promptly at Megalopolis. But the people of Lykaia, Tricoloni,
Lykosoura and Trapezus, but no other Arcadians, repented and, being no
longer ready to abandon their ancient cities, were, with the exception
of the last, taken to Megalopolis by force against their will,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.6">

while the inhabitants of Trapezus departed altogether from the
Peloponnesus, such of them as were left and were not immediately
massacred by the exasperated Arcadians. Those who escaped with their
lives sailed away to Pontos and were welcomed by the citizens of
Trapezus on the Euxine as their kindred, as they bore their name and
came from their mother-city. The people of Lykosoura, although they had
disobeyed, were nevertheless spared by the Arcadians because of Demeter
and the Mistress, in whose sanctuary they had taken refuge.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.7">

Of the other cities I have mentioned, some are altogether deserted in
our time, some are held by the people of Megalopolis as villages, namely
Gortys, Dipoenae, Theisoa near Orkhomenos, Methydrium, Teuthis, Kalliai,
Helisson. Only one of them, Pallantion, was destined to meet with a
kindlier fate even then. Aliphera has continued to be regarded as a city
from the beginning to the present day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.8">

Megalopolis was united into one city in the same year, but a few months
later, as occurred the defeat of the Lacedaemonians at Leuktra, when
Phrasikleides was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the second year of the hundred and second Olympiad,[^506] when Damon of
Thourioi was victor in the foot-race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.9">

When the citizens of Megalopolis had been enrolled in the Theban
alliance they had nothing to fear from the Lacedaemonians. But when the
Thebans became involved in what was called the Sacred War, and they were
hard pressed by the men of Phokis, who were neighbors of the Boeotians,
and wealthy because they had seized the sanctuary at Delphi,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.10">

then the Lacedaemonians, if eagerness would have done it, would have
removed bodily the Megalopolitans and the other Arcadians besides; but
as the Arcadians of the day put up a vigorous defence, while their
vassal neighbors gave them wholehearted assistance, no achievement of
note was accomplished by either side. But the hatred felt by the
Arcadians for the Lacedaemonians was not a little responsible for the
rise of Philip, the son of Amyntas, and of the Macedonian empire, and
the Arcadians did not help the Greeks at Khaironeia or again in the
struggle in Thessaly.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.11">

After a short time a tyrant arose at Megalopolis in the person of
Aristodemos, a Phigalian by birth and a son of Artylas, who had been
adopted by Tritaios, an influential citizen of Megalopolis. This
Aristodemos, in spite of his being a tyrant, nevertheless won the
surname of “the Good.” During his tyranny the territory of Megalopolis
was invaded by the Lacedaemonians under Akrotatos, the eldest of the
sons of King Kleomenes, whose lineage I have already traced with that of
all the other Spartan kings.[^507] A fierce battle took place, and after
many had fallen on both sides the army of Megalopolis had the better of
the encounter. Among the Spartan killed was Akrotatos, who never
succeeded to the throne of his fathers.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.12">

Some two generations after the death of Aristodemos, Lydiades became
tyrant, a man of distinguished family, by nature ambitious and, as he
proved later, a devoted patriot. For he came to power while still young,
but on reaching years of discretion he was minded to resign voluntarily
the tyranny, although by this time his power was securely established.
At this time Megalopolis was already a member of the Achaean League, and
Lydiades became so famous among not only the people of Megalopolis but
also all the Achaeans that he rivalled the fame of Aratos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.13">

The Lacedaemonians with all their forces under Agis, the son of
Eudamidas, the king of the other house, attacked Megalopolis with larger
and stronger forces than those collected by Akrotatos. They overcame in
battle the men of Megalopolis, who came out against them, and bringing
up a powerful engine against the wall they shook by it the tower in this
place, and hoped on the morrow to knock it down by the engine.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.14">

But the north wind was not only to prove a help to the whole Greek
nation, when it dashed the greater part of the Persian fleet on the
Sepiad rocks, but it also saved Megalopolis from being captured. For it
blew violently and continuously, and broke up the engine of Agis,
scattering it to utter destruction. The Agis whom the north wind
prevented from taking Megalopolis is the man from whom was taken Pellene
in Achaea by the Sikyonians under Aratos, and later he met his end at
Mantineia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.15">

Shortly afterwards Kleomenes the son of Leonidas seized Megalopolis
during a truce. Of the Megalopolitans some fell at once on the night of
the capture in the defence of their country, when Lydiades too met his
death in he battle,[^508] fighting nobly; others, about two-thirds of
those of military age along with the women and children, escaped to
Messenia with Philopoimen the son of Kraugis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.16">

But those who were caught in the city were massacred by Kleomenes, who
razed it to the ground and burned it. How the Megalopolitans restored
their city, and their achievements on their return, will be set forth in
my account of Philopoimen. The Lacedaemonian people were in no way
responsible for the disaster to Megalopolis, because Kleomenes had
changed their constitution from a kingship to a tyranny.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.27.17">

As I have already related, the boundary between Megalopolis and Heraia
is at the source of the river Bouphagos. The river got its name, they
say, from a hero called Bouphagos, the son of Iapetos and Thornax. This
is what they call her in Laconia also. They also say that Artemis shot
Bouphagos on Mount Pholoe because he attempted an unholy sin against her
godhead.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.28.1">

As you go from the source of the river, you will reach first a place
called Maratha, and after it Gortys, which today is a village, but of
old was a city. Here there is a temple of Asklepios, made of Pentelic
marble, with the god, as a beardless youth, and an image of Hygieia.
Scopas was the artist. The natives also say that Alexander the son of
Philip dedicated to Asklepios his breastplate and spear. The breastplate
and the head of the spear are still there today.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.28.2">

Through Gortys flows a river called by those who live around its source
the Lusios (Bathing Riuer), because Zeus after his birth was bathed in
it; those farther from the source call it the Gortynios after the
village. The water of this Gortynios is colder than that of any other
river. The Danube, Rhine, Hypanis, Borysthenes, and all rivers the
streams of which freeze in winter, as they flow through land on which
there is snow the greater part of the time, while the air about them is
full of frost, might in my opinion rightly be called wintry;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.28.3">

I call the water cold of those which flow through a land with a good
climate and in summer have water refreshing to drink and to bathe in,
without being painful in winter. Cold in this sense is the water of the
Cydnus which passes through Tarsus, and of the Melas which flows past
Side in Pamphylia. The coldness of the Ales in Kolophon has even been
celebrated in the verse of elegiac poets. But the Gortynios surpasses
them all in coldness, especially in the season of summer. It has its
source in Theisoa, which borders on Methydrium. The place where its
stream joins the Alpheios is called Rhaeteae.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.28.4">

Adjoining the land of Theisoa is a village called Teuthis, which in old
days was a town. In the Trojan war the inhabitants supplied a general of
their own. His name according to some was Teuthis, according to others
Ornytos. When the Greeks failed to secure favorable winds to take them
from Aulis, but were shut in for a long time by a violent gale, Teuthis
quarrelled with Agamemnon and was about to lead the Arcadians under his
command back home again.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.28.5">

Whereupon, they say, Athena in the guise of Melas, the son of Ops, tried
to turn Teuthis aside from his journey home. But Teuthis, his wrath
swelling within him, struck with his spear the thigh of the goddess, and
actually did lead his army back from Aulis. On his return to his native
land the goddess appeared to him in a vision with a wound in her thigh.
After this a wasting disease fell on Teuthis, and its people, alone of
the Arcadians, suffered from famine.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.28.6">

Later, oracles were delivered to them from Dodona, telling them what to
do to appease the goddess, and in particular they had an image of Athena
made with a wound in the thigh. This image I have myself seen, with its
thigh swathed in a purple bandage. There are also at Teuthis sanctuaries
of Aphrodite and Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.28.7">

These are the notable things at Teuthis. On the road from Gortys to
Megalopolis stands the tomb of those who were killed in the fight with
Kleomenes. This tomb the Megalopolitans call Paraebasium (Transgression)
because Kleomenes broke his truce with them. Adjoining Paraebasium is a
plain about sixty stadium-lengths across. On the right of the road are
ruins of a city Brenthe, and here rises a river Brentheates, which some
five stadium-lengths farther on falls into the Alpheios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.29.1">

After crossing the Alpheios you come to what is called Trapezuntian
territory and to the ruins of a city Trapezus. On the left, as you go
down again from Trapezus to the Alpheios, there is, not far from the
river, a place called Bathos (Depth), where they celebrate mysteries
every other year to the Great Goddesses. Here there is a spring called
Olympias which, during every other year, does not flow, and near the
spring rises up fire. The Arcadians say that the fabled battle between
giants and gods took place here and not at Pellene in Thrace, and at
this spot sacrifices are offered to lightnings, hurricanes and thunders.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.29.2">

Homer does not mention giants at all in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>, but in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> he relates how the
Laestrygones attacked the ships of Odysseus in the likeness not of men
but of giants,[^509] and he makes also the king of the Phaeacians say
that the Phaeacians are near to the gods like the Cyclopes and the
lineage of giants.[^510] In these places then he indicates that the
giants are mortal, and not of divine lineage, and his words in the
following passage are plainer still:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Who once was king among the haughty giants;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

But he destroyed the infatuate folk, and was destroyed himself.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 7.59–60

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

“Folk” in the poetry of Homer means the common people.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.29.3">

That the giants had serpents for feet is an absurd tale, as many pieces
of evidence show, especially the following incident. The Syrian river
Orontes does not flow its whole course to the sea on a level, but meets
a precipitous ridge with a slope away from it. The Roman emperor[^511]
wished ships to sail up the river from the sea to Antioch. So with much
labor and expense he dug a channel suitable for ships to sail up, and
turned the course of the river into this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.29.4">

But when the old bed had dried up, an earthenware coffin more than
eleven cubits long was found in it, and the corpse was proportionately
large, and human in all parts of its body. This corpse the god in
Klaros, when the Syrians came to his oracle there, declared to be
Orontes, and that he was of Indian lineage. If it was by warming the
earth of old when it was still wet and saturated with moisture that the
sun made the first men, what other land is likely to have raised men
either before India or of greater size, seeing that even today it still
breeds beasts monstrous in their weird appearance and monstrous in size?

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.29.5">

Some ten stadium-lengths distant from the place named Depth is what is
called Basilis. The founder of it was Kypselos, who gave his daughter in
marriage to Kresphontes, the son of Aristomakhos. Today Basilis is in
ruins, among which remains a sanctuary of Eleusinian Demeter. Going on
from here you will cross the Alpheios again and reach Thocnia, which is
named after Thocnus, the son of Lykaon, and today is altogether
uninhabited. Thocnus was said to have built the city on the hill. The
river Aminios, flowing by the hill, falls into the Helisson, and not far
away the Helisson falls into the Alpheios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.1">

This Helisson, beginning at a village of the same name—for the name of
the village also is Helisson—passes through the lands of Dipaea and
Iycaea, and then through Megalopolis itself, descending into the
Alpheios twenty stadium-lengths away from the city of Megalopolis. Near
the city is a temple of Poseidon Overseer. I found the head of the image
still remaining.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.2">

The river Helisson divides Megalopolis just as Knidos and Mitylene are
cut in two by their straits, and in the north section, on the right as
one looks down the river, the townsfolk have made their marketplace. In
it is an enclosure of stones and a sanctuary of Zeus Lykaios, with no
entrance into it. The things inside, however, can be seen —altars of the
god, two tables, two eagles, and an image of Pan made of stone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.3">

His surname is Sinoeis, and they say that Pan was so surnamed after a
nymph Sinoe, who with others of the nymphs nursed him on her own
account. There is before this enclosure a bronze image of Apollo worth
seeing, in height twelve feet, brought from Phigalia as a contribution
to the adornment of Megalopolis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.4">

The place where the image was originally set up by the Phigalians is
named Bassae. The surname of the god has followed him from Phigalia, but
why he received the name of Helper will be set forth in my account of
Phigalia. On the right of the Apollo is a small image of the Mother of
the Gods, but of the temple there remains nothing save the pillars.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.5">

Before the temple of the Mother is no statue, but I found still to be
seen the pedestals on which statues once stood. An inscription in
elegiacs on one of the pedestals says that the statue was that of
Diophanes, the son of Diaios, the man who first united the whole
Peloponnesus into what was named the Achaean League.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.6">

The portico of the marketplace, called the Philippeium, was not made by
Philip, the son of Amyntas, but as a compliment to him the
Megalopolitans gave his name to the building. Near it I found a temple
of Hermes Akakesios in ruins, with nothing remaining except a tortoise
of stone. Adjoining this Philippeium is another portico, smaller in
size, where stand the government offices of Megalopolis, six rooms in
number. In one of them is an image of Ephesian Artemis, and in another a
bronze Pan, surnamed Scoleitas, one cubit high.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.7">

It was brought from the hill Scoleitas, which is within the walls, and
from a spring on it a stream descends to the Helisson. Behind the
government offices is a temple of Fortune with a stone image not less
than five feet high. The portico called Myropolis, situated in the
marketplace, was built from the spoils taken when the Lacedaemonians
fighting under Akrotatos, the son of Kleomenes, suffered the reverse
sustained at the hands of Aristodemos, then tyrant of Megalopolis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.8">

In the marketplace of that city, behind the enclosure sacred to Zeus
Lykaios, is the figure of a man carved in relief on a slab, Polybius,
the son of Lykortas. Elegiac verses are inscribed upon it saying that he
roamed over every land and every sea, and that he became the ally of the
Itomans and stayed their wrath against the Greek nation. This Polybius
wrote also a history of the Romans, including how they went to war with
Carthage, what the cause of the war was, and how at last, not before
great dangers had been run, Scipio … whom they name Carthaginian,
because he put an end to the war and razed Carthage to the ground.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.9">

Whenever the Romans obeyed the advice of Polybius, things went well with
them, but they say that whenever they would not listen to his
instructions they made mistakes. All the Greek cities that were members
of the Achaean League got permission from the Itomans that Polybius
should draw up constitutions for them and frame laws. On the left of the
portrait-statue of Polybius is the Council Chamber.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.30.10">

Here then is the Chamber, but the portico named after Aristandros in the
marketplace was built, they say, by Aristandros, one of their townsfolk.
Quite near to this portico, on the east, is a sanctuary of Zeus,
surnamed Savior. It is adorned with pillars round it. Zeus is seated on
a throne, and by his side stand Megalopolis on the right and an image of
Artemis Savior on the left. These are of Pentelic marble and were made
by the Athenians Kephisodotos and Xenophon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.1">

At the other end, the western, of the portico is an enclosure sacred to
the Great Goddesses. The Great Goddesses are Demeter and the Maiden, as
I have already explained in my account of Messenia,[^512] and the Maiden
is called Savior by the Arcadians. Carved in relief before the entrance
are, on one side Artemis, on the other Asklepios and Hygieia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.2">

Of the Great Goddesses, Demeter is of stone throughout, but the Savior
has drapery of wood. The height of each is about fifteen feet. The
images … and before them he made small maids in tunics reaching to the
ankles, each of whom carries on her head a basket full of flowers. They
are said to be daughters of Damophon, but those inclining to a more
religious interpretation hold that they are Athena and Artemis gathering
the flowers with Persephone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.3">

By the side of Demeter there is also a Hēraklēs about a cubit high. This
Hēraklēs, says Onomacritus in his poem, is one of those called Idaean
Dactyls. Before it stands a table, on which are carved in relief two
seasons, Pan with pipes, and Apollo playing the harp. There is also an
inscription by them saying that they are among the first gods.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.4">

Nymphs too are carved on the table: Neda carrying an infant Zeus,
Anthracia, another Arcadian nymph, holding a torch, and Hagno with a
water-pot in one hand and a bowl in the other. Ankhirhoe and Myrtoessa
carry water-pots, with what is meant to be water coming down from them.
Within the precinct is a temple of Zeus Friendly. Polycleitus of Argos
made the image; it is like Dionysus in having buskins as footwear and in
holding a beaker in one hand and a thyrsus in the other, but an eagle
sitting on the thyrsus does not fit in with the received accounts of
Dionysus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.5">

Behind this temple is a small grove of trees surrounded by a wall;
nobody may go inside, and before it are images of Demeter and the Maiden
some three feet high. Within the enclosure of the Great Goddesses is
also a sanctuary of Aphrodite. Before the entrance are old wooden images
of Hērā, Apollo and the Muses, brought, it is said, from Trapezus,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.6">

and in the temple are images made by Damophon, a wooden Hermes and a
wooden Aphrodite with hands, face and feet of stone. The surname Deviser
given to the goddess is, in my opinion, a most apt one; for very many
are the devices, and most varied are the forms of speech invented by men
because of Aphrodite and her works.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.7">

In a building stand statues also, those of Kallignotos, Mentas,
Sosigenes and Polus. These men are said to have been the first to
establish at Megalopolis the mysteries of the Great Goddesses, and the
ritual acts are a copy of those at Eleusis. Within the enclosure of the
goddesses are the following images, which all have a square shape:
Hermes, surnamed Agetor, Apollo, Athena, Poseidon, Sun too, surnamed
Savior, and Hēraklēs. There has also been built for them a \<sanctuary\>
of vast size, and here they celebrate the mysteries in honor of the
goddesses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.8">

To the right of the temple of the Great Goddesses there is also a
sanctuary of the Maiden. The image is of stone, about eight feet high;
ribbons cover the pedestal all over. Women may enter this sanctuary at
all times, but men enter it only once every year. Adjoining the
marketplace on the west there is built a gymnasium.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.31.9">

Behind the portico called after Philip of Macedon are two hills, rising
to no great height. Ruins of a sanctuary of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Poliás</span> (‘of the Polis’)
are on one, while on the other[^513] a temple of Hērā Full-grown, this
too being in ruins. Under this hill is a spring called Bathyllos, which
is one of the tributaries that swell the Helisson.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.32.1">

Such are the notable things on this site. The southern portion, on the
other side of the river, can boast of the largest theater in all Greece,
and in it is a spring which never fails. Not far from the theater are
left foundations of the council house built for the Ten Thousand
Arcadians, and called Thersilium after the man who dedicated it. Hard by
is a house, belonging today to a private person, which originally was
built for Alexander, the son of Philip. By the house is an image of
Ammon, like the square images of Hermes, with a ram’s horns on his head.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.32.2">

The sanctuary built in common for the Muses, Apollo and Hermes had for
me to record only a few foundations, but there was still one of the
Muses, with an image of Apollo after the style of the square Hermae. The
sanctuary of Aphrodite too was in ruins, save that there were left the
fore-temple mid three images, one surnamed the celestial one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ourania</span>\], the second
surnamed the one who is common to the whole district
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Pan-dēmos</span>\], and the
third without a surname.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.32.3">

At no great distance is an altar of Ares, and it was said that
originally a sanctuary too was built for the god. Beyond the Aphrodite
is built also a race-course, extending on one side to the theater (and
here they have a spring, held sacred to Dionysus), while at the other
end of the race-course a temple of Dionysus was said to have been struck
by lightning two generations before my time, and a few ruins of it were
still there when I saw it. The temple near the race-course shared by
Hēraklēs and Hermes was no longer there, only their altar was left.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.32.4">

There is also in this district a hill to the east, and on it a temple of
Artemis Huntress this too was dedicated by Aristodemos. To the right of
the Huntress is a precinct. Here there is a sanctuary of Asklepios, with
images of the god and of Hygieia, and a little lower down there are
gods, also of square shape, surnamed Workers, Athena Worker and Apollo,
God of Streets. To Hermes, Hēraklēs and Eileithuia are attached
traditions from the poems of Homer: that Hermes is the minister of Zeus
and leads the souls of the departed down to Hades,[^514] and that
Hēraklēs accomplished many difficult tasks;[^515] Eileithuia, he says in
the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>, cares for the pangs
of women.[^516]

Under this hill there is another sanctuary of Boy Asklepios. His image
is upright and about a cubit in height, that of Apollo is seated on a
throne and is not less than six feet high. Here are also kept bones, too
big for those of a human being, about which the story ran that they were
those of one of the giants mustered by Hopladamos to fight for Rhea, as
my story will relate hereafter. Near this sanctuary is a spring, the
water flowing down from which is received by the Helisson.

Megalopolis was founded by the Arcadians with the utmost enthusiasm
amidst the highest hopes of the Greeks, but it has lost all its beauty
and its old prosperity, being today for the most part in ruins. I am not
in the least surprised, as I know that the supernatural force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò daimonion</span>\] is
always willing something new, and likewise that all things, strong or
weak, increasing or decreasing, are being changed by Fortune, who drives
them with imperious necessity according to her whim.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.33.2">

For Mycenae, the leader of the Greeks in the Trojan war, and Nineveh,
where was the royal palace of the Assyrians, are utterly ruined and
desolate; while Boeotian Thebes, once deemed worthy to be the head of
the Greek people, why, its name includes only the acropolis and its few
inhabitants. Of the opulent places in the ancient world, Egyptian Thebes
and Minyan Orkhomenos are now less prosperous than a private individual
of moderate means, while Delos, once the common market of Greece, has no
Delian inhabitant, but only the men sent by the Athenians to guard the
sanctuary.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.33.3">

At Babylon the sanctuary of Belus still is left, but of the Babylon that
was the greatest city of its time under the sun nothing remains but the
wall. The case of Tiryns in the Argolid is the same. These places have
been reduced by the superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] to nothing.
But the city of Alexander in Egypt, and that of Seleukos on the Orontes,
that were founded but yesterday, have reached their present size and
prosperity because fortune favors them.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.33.4">

The following incident proves the might of fortune to be greater and
more marvelous than is shown by the disasters and prosperity of cities.
No long sail from Lemnos was once an island Khryse, where, it is said,
Philoctetes met with his accident from the water-snake. But the waves
utterly overwhelmed it, and Khryse sank and disappeared in the depths.
Another island called Hiera (Sacred) … was not during this time. So
temporary and utterly weak are the fortunes of men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.34.1">

As you go from Megalopolis to Messene, after advancing about seven
stadium-lengths, there stands on the left of the highway a sanctuary of
goddesses. They call the goddesses themselves, as well as the district
around the sanctuary, Maniai (Madnesses). In my view this is a surname
of the Eumenides; in fact they say that it was here that madness
overtook Orestes as punishment for shedding his mother’s blood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.34.2">

Not far from the sanctuary is a mound of earth, of no great size,
surmounted by a finger made of stone; the name, indeed, of the mound is
the Tomb of the Finger. Here, it is said, Orestes on losing his wits bit
off one finger of one of his hands. Adjoining this place is another,
called Ace (Remedies) because in it Orestes was cured of his malady.
Here too there is a sanctuary for the Eumenides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.34.3">

The story is that, when these goddesses were about to put Orestes out of
his mind, they appeared to him black; but when he had bitten off his
finger they seemed to him again to be white and he recovered his senses
at the sight. So he offered a sin-offering to the black goddesses to
avert their wrath, while to the white deities he sacrificed a
thank-offering. It is customary to sacrifice to the Graces also along
with the Eumenides. Near to the place called Ace is another … a
sanctuary called … because here Orestes cut off his hair on coming to
his senses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.34.4">

Historians of Peloponnesian antiquities say that what Clytaemnestra’s
Furies did to Orestes in Arcadia took place before the trial at the
Areiopagos; that his accuser was not Tyndareus, who no longer lived, but
Perilaos, who asked for vengeance for the mother’s murder in that he was
a cousin of Clytaemnestra. For Perilaos, they say, was a son of Ikarios,
to whom afterwards daughters also were born.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.34.5">

The road from Maniaito the Alpheios is roughly fifteen stadium-lengths
long. At this point the river Gatheatas falls into the Alpheios, and
before this the Carnion flows into the Gatheatas. The source of the
Carnion is in the territory of Aigytia beneath the sanctuary of Apollo
Cereatas; that of the Gatheatas is at Gatheaiin Cromitian territory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.34.6">

The Cromitian territory is about forty stadium-lengths up from the
Alpheios, and in it the ruins of the city Cromi have not entirely
disappeared. From Cromi it is about twenty stadium-lengths to Nymphas,
which is well supplied with water and covered with trees. From Nymphas
it is twenty stadium-lengths to the Hermaeum, where is the boundary
between Messenia and Megalopolis. Here they have made a Hermes also on a
slab.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.1">

This road leads to Messene, and there is another leading from
Megalopolis to Carnasium in Messenia. The first thing you come to on the
latter road is the Alpheios at the place where it is joined by the Malus
and the Scyrus, whose waters have already united. From this point
keeping the Malus on the right after about thirty stadium-lengths you
will cross it and ascend along a rather steep road to a place called
Phaedrias.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.2">

About fifteen stadium-lengths distant from Phaedrias is an Hermaeum
called ‘by the Mistress’; it too forms a boundary between Messenia and
Megalopolis. There are small images of the Mistress and Demeter;
likewise of Hermes and Hēraklēs. I am of opinion that the wooden image
also, made for Hēraklēs by Daidalos, stood here on the borders of
Messenia and Arcadia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.3">

The road from Megalopolis to Lacedaemon is thirty stadium-lengths long
at the Alpheios. After this you will travel beside a river Theios, which
is a tributary of the Alpheios, and some forty stadium-lengths from the
Alpheios leaving the Theios on the left you will come to Phalaesiae.
This place is twenty stadium-lengths away from the Hermaeum at Belemina.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.4">

The Arcadians say that Belemina belonged of old to Arcadia but was
severed from it by the Lacedaemonians. This account struck me as
improbable on various grounds, chiefly because the Thebans, I think,
would never have allowed the Arcadians to suffer even this loss, if they
could have brought about restitution with justice.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.5">

There are also roads from Megalopolis leading to the interior of
Arcadia; to Methydrium it is one hundred and seventy stadium-lengths,
and thirteen stadium-lengths from Megalopolis is a place called Scias,
where are ruins of a sanctuary of Artemis Sciatis, said to have been
built by Aristodemos the tyrant. About ten stadium-lengths from here are
a few memorials of the city Kharisiai, and the journey from Kharisiai to
Trikolōnoi is another ten stadium-lengths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.6">

Once Trikolōnoi also was a city, and even today there still remains on a
hill a sanctuary of Poseidon with a square image, and around the
sanctuary stands a grove of trees. These cities had as founders the sons
of Lykaon; but Zoetia, some fifteen stadium-lengths from Tricoloni, not
lying on the straight road but to the left of Tricoloni, was founded,
they say, by Zoeteus, the son of Tricolonus. Paroreus, the younger of
the sons of Tricolonus, also founded a city, in this case Paroria, ten
stadium-lengths distant from Zoetia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.7">

Today both towns are without inhabitants. In Zoetia, however, there
still remains a temple of Demeter and Artemis. There are also other
ruins of cities: of Thyraeum, fifteen stadium-lengths from Paroria, and
of Hypsus, lying above the plain on a mountain which is also called
Hypsus. The district between Thyraeum and Hypsus is all mountainous and
full of wild beasts. My narrative has already pointed out that Thyraios
and Hypsus were sons of Lykaon.[^520]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.8">

To the right of Tricoloni there is first a steep road ascending to a
spring called Cruni. Descending from Cruni for about thirty
stadium-lengths you come to the tomb of Kallisto, a high mound of earth,
whereon grow many trees, both cultivated and also those that bear no
fruit. On the top of the mound is a sanctuary of Artemis, surnamed
Kalliste (Most Beautiful). I believe it was because he had learned it
from the Arcadians that Pamphos was the first in his poems to call
Artemis by the name of Kalliste.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.9">

Twenty-five stadium-lengths from here, a hundred stadium-lengths in all
from Tricoloni, there is on the Helisson, on the straight road to
Methydrium, the only city left to be described on the road from
Tricoloni, a place called Anemosa, and also Mount Phalanthus, on which
are the ruins of a city Phalanthus. It is said that Phalanthus was a son
of Agelaos, a son of Stymphalos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.35.10">

Beyond this is a plain called the Plain of Polus, and after it Schoenus,
so named from a Boeotian, Schoeneus. If this Schoeneus emigrated to
Arcadia, the race-courses of Atalanta, which are near Schoenus, probably
got their name from his daughter. Adjoining is … in my opinion called,
and they say that the land here is Arcadia to all.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.1">

From this point nothing remains to be recorded except Methydrium itself,
which is distant from Tricoloni one hundred and thirty-seven
stadium-lengths. It received the name Methydrium (Between the Waters)
because there is a high knoll between the river Maloitas and the Mylaon,
and on it Orkhomenos built his city. Methydrium too had citizens
victorious at Olympia before it belonged to Megalopolis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.2">

There is in Methydrium a temple of Horse Poseidon, standing by the
Mylaon. But Mount Thaumasios (Wonderful) lies beyond the river Maloitas,
and the Methydrians hold that when Rhea was pregnant with Zeus, she came
to this mountain and enlisted as her allies, in case Kronos should
attack her, Hopladamos and his few giants:

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.3">

They allow that she gave birth to her son on some part of Mount Lykaios,
but they claim that here Kronos was deceived, and here is where they say
that the storied substitution of a stone for the child happened. On the
summit of the mountain is Rhea’s Cave, into which no human beings may
enter save only the women who are sacred to the goddess.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.4">

About thirty stadium-lengths from Methydrium is a spring Nymphasia, and
it is also thirty stadium-lengths from Nymphasia to the common
boundaries of Megalopolis, Orkhomenos and Caphyae.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.5">

Passing through the gate at Megalopolis named the Gate to the Marsh, and
proceeding by the side of the river Helisson towards Mainalos, there
stands on the left of the road a temple of the Good God. If the gods are
givers of good things to men, and if Zeus is supreme among gods, it
would be consistent to infer that this surname is that of Zeus. A short
distance farther on is a mound of earth which is the tomb of
Aristodemos, whom in spite of his being a tyrant they could not help
calling the Good and there is also a sanctuary of Athena surnamed
Contriver, because the goddess is the inventor of plans and devices of
all sorts.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.6">

On the right of the road there has been made a precinct to the North
Wind, and the Megalopolitans offer sacrifices every year, holding none
of the gods in greater honor than the North Wind, because he proved
their saviour from the Lacedaemonians under Agis. Next is the tomb of
Oikles, the father of Amphiaraos, if indeed he met his end in Arcadia,
and not after he had joined Hēraklēs in his campaign against Laomedon.
After it comes a temple of Demeter styled in the Marsh and her grove,
which is five stadium-lengths away from the city, and women only may
enter it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.7">

Thirty stadium-lengths away is a place named Paliskios. Going on from
Paliskios and leaving on the left the Elaphus, an intermittent stream,
after an advance of some twenty stadium-lengths you reach ruins of
Peraethenses, among which is a sanctuary of Pan. If you cross the
torrent and go straight on for fifteen stadium-lengths you come to a
plain, and after crossing it to the mountain called, like the plain,
Maenalian. Under the fringe of the mountain are traces of a city Lykoa,
a sanctuary of Artemis Lykoan, and a bronze image of her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.8">

On the southern slope of the mountain once stood Sumetia. On this
mountain is what is called the Meeting of the Three Ways, whence the
Mantineians fetched the bones of Arkas, the son of Kallisto, at the
bidding of the Delphic oracle. There are still left ruins of Mainalos
itself: traces of a temple of Athena, one race-course for athletes and
one for horses. Mount Mainalos is held to be especially sacred to Pan,
so that those who dwell around it say that they can actually hear him
playing on his pipes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.9">

From the sanctuary of the Mistress to the city of Megalopolis it is
forty stadium-lengths. From Megalopolis to the stream of the Alpheios is
half this distance. After crossing the river it is two stadium-lengths
from the Alpheios to the ruins of Macareae, from these to the ruins of
Daseaiseven stadium-lengths, and seven again from Daseaito the hill
called Acacesian Hill.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.36.10">

At the foot of this hill used to be a city Acacesium, and even today
there is on the hill a stone image of Acacesian Hermes, the story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] of the
Arcadians about it being that here the child Hermes was reared, and that
Acacus the son of Lykaon became his foster-father. The Theban tell it
differently, and the people of Tanagra, again, tell their tale at
variance with the Theban.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.1">

From Acacesium it is four stadium-lengths to the sanctuary of the
Mistress. First in this place is a temple of Artemis Leader, with a
bronze image, holding torches, which I conjecture to be about six feet
high. From this place there is an entrance into the sacred enclosure of
the Mistress. As you go to the temple there is a portico on the right,
with reliefs of white marble on the wall. On the first relief are
crafted Fates and Zeus surnamed Guide of Fate, and on the second
Hēraklēs wresting a tripod from Apollo. What I learned about the story
of the two latter I will tell if I get as far as an account of Delphi in
my history of Phokis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.2">

In the portico by the Mistress there is, between the reliefs I have
mentioned, a tablet with descriptions[^521] of the mysteries. On the
third relief are nymphs and Pans; on the fourth is Polybius, the son of
Lykortas. On the latter is also an inscription, declaring that Greece
would never have fallen at all, if she had obeyed Polybius in
everything, and when she met disaster her only help came from him. In
front of the temple is an altar to Demeter and another to the Mistress,
after which is one of the Great Mother.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.3">

The actual images of the goddesses, Mistress and Demeter, the throne on
which they sit, along with the footstool under their feet, are all made
out of one piece of stone. No part of the drapery, and no part of the
carvings about the throne, is fastened to another stone by iron or
cement, but the whole is from one block. This stone was not brought in
by them, but they say that in obedience to a dream they dug up the earth
within the enclosure and so found it. The size of both images just about
corresponds to the image of the Mother in Athens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.4">

These too are works of Damophon. Demeter carries a torch in her right
hand; her other hand she has laid upon the Mistress. The Mistress has on
her knees a staff and what is called the box, which she holds in her
right hand. On both sides of the throne are images. By the side of
Demeter stands Artemis wrapped in the skin of a deer, and carrying a
quiver on her shoulders, while in one hand she holds a torch, in the
other two serpents; by her side a bitch, of a breed suitable for
hunting, is lying down.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.5">

By the image of the Mistress stands Anytos, represented as a man in
armor. Those about the sanctuary say that the Mistress was brought up by
Anytos, who was one of the Titans, as they are called. The first to
introduce Titans into poetry was Homer,[^522] representing them as gods
down in what is called Tartarus; the lines are in the passage about
Hērā’s oath. From Homer the name of the Titans was taken by Onomacritus,
who in the orgies he composed for Dionysus made the Titans the authors
of the god’s sufferings.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.6">

This is the story of Anytos told by the Arcadians. That Artemis was the
daughter, not of Leto but of Demeter, which is the Egyptian account, the
Greeks learned from Aeschylus the son of Euphorion. The story of the
Kouretes, who are represented under the images, and that of the
Corybantes (a lineage different from that of the Kouretes), carved in
relief upon the base, I know, but pass them by.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.7">

The Arcadians bring into the sanctuary the fruit of all cultivated trees
except the pomegranate. On the right as you go out of the temple there
is a mirror fitted into the wall. If anyone looks into this mirror, he
will see himself very dimly indeed or not at all, but the actual images
of the gods and the throne can be seen quite clearly.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.8">

When you have gone up a little, beside the temple of the Mistress on the
right is what is called the Hall, where the Arcadians celebrate
mysteries, and sacrifice to the Mistress many victims in generous
fashion. Every man of them sacrifices what he possesses. But he does not
cut the throats of the victims, as is done in other sacrifices; each man
chops off a limb of the sacrifice, just that which happens to come to
hand.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.9">

This Mistress the Arcadians worship more than any other god, declaring
that she is a daughter of Poseidon and Demeter. Mistress is her surname
among the many, just as they surname Demeter’s daughter by Zeus the
Maiden. But whereas the real name of the Maiden is Persephone, as
Homer[^523] and Pamphos before him say in their poems, the real name of
the Mistress I am afraid to write to the uninitiated.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.10">

Beyond what is called the Hall is a grove, sacred to the Mistress and
surrounded by a wall of stones, and within it are trees, including an
olive and an evergreen oak growing out of one root, and that not the
result of a clever piece of gardening. Beyond the grove are altars of
Horse Poseidon, as being the father of the Mistress, and of other gods
as well. On the last of them is an inscription saying that it is common
to all the gods.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.11">

Thence you will ascend by stairs to a sanctuary of Pan. Within the
sanctuary has been made a portico, and a small image; and this Pan too,
equally with the most powerful gods, can bring men’s prayers to
accomplishment and repay the wicked as they deserve. Beside this Pan a
fire is kept burning which is never allowed to go out. It is said that
in days of old this god also gave oracles, and that the nymph Erato
became his prophetess, she who wedded Arkas, the son of Kallisto.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.37.12">

They also remember verses of Erato, which I too myself have read. Here
is an altar of Ares, and there are two images of Aphrodite in a temple,
one of white marble, and the other, the older, of wood. There are also
wooden images of Apollo and of Athena. Of Athena a sanctuary also has
been made.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.1">

A little farther up is the circuit of the wall of Lykosoura, in which
there are a few inhabitants. Of all the cities that earth has ever
shown, whether on mainland or on islands, Lykosoura is the oldest, and
was the first that the sun beheld; from it the rest of mankind have
learned how to make them cities.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.2">

On the left of the sanctuary of the Mistress is Mount Lykaios. Some
Arcadians call it Olympus, and others Sacred Peak. On it, they say, Zeus
was reared. There is a place on Mount Lykaioscalled Cretea, on the left
of the grove of Apollo surnamed Parrhasian. The Arcadians claim that the
Crete, where the Cretan story has it that Zeus was reared, was this
place and not the island.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.3">

The nymphs, by whom they say that Zeus was reared, they call Theisoa,
Neda and Hagno. After Theisoa was named a city in Parrhasia; Theisoa
today is a village in the district of Megalopolis. From Neda the river
Neda takes its name; from Hagno a spring on Mount Lykaios, which like
the Danube flows with an equal volume of water in winter just as in the
season of summer.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.4">

Should a drought persist for a long time, and the seeds in the earth and
the trees wither, then the priest of Zeus Lykaios, after praying towards
the water and making the usual sacrifices, lowers an oak branch to the
surface of the spring, not letting it sink deep. When the water has been
stirred up there rises a vapor, like mist; after a time the mist becomes
cloud, gathers to itself other clouds, and makes rain fall on the land
of the Arcadians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.5">

There is on Mount Lykaios a sanctuary of Pan, and a grove of trees
around it, with a race-course in front of which is a running-track. Of
old they used to hold here the games called Lykaia. Here there are also
bases of statues, with now no statues on them. On one of the bases an
elegiac inscription declares that the statue was a portrait of Astyanax,
and that Astyanax was of the lineage of Arceas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.6">

Among the marvels of Mount Lykaios the most wondrous is this. On it is a
precinct of Zeus Lykaios, into which people are not allowed to enter. If
anyone takes no notice of the rule and enters, he must inevitably live
no longer than a year. And it was said, moreover, that everything alike
within the precinct, whether beast or man, cast no shadow. For this
reason when a beast takes refuge in the precinct, the hunter will not

behold no shadow. In Syene also just on this side of Aethiopia neither
tree nor creature casts a shadow so long as the sun is in the
constellation of the Crab, but the precinct on Mount Lykaios affects
shadows in the same way always and at every season.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.7">

On the highest point of the mountain is a mound of earth, forming an
altar of Zeus Lykaios, and from it most of the Peloponnesus can be seen.
Before the altar on the east stand two pillars, on which there were of
old gilded eagles. On this altar they sacrifice in secret to Zeus
Lykaios. I was reluctant to pry into the details of the sacrifice; let
them be as they are and were from the beginning.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.8">

On the east side of the mountain there is a sanctuary of Apollo surnamed
Parrhasian. They also give him the name Pythian. They hold every year a
festival in honor of the god and sacrifice in the marketplace a boar to
Apollo Helper, and after the sacrifice here they at once carry the
victim to the sanctuary of Parrhasian Apollo in procession to the tune
of the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>
\[‘double-reed’\]; cutting out the thigh-bones they burn them, and also
consume the meat of the victim on the spot.

This it is their custom to do. To the north of Mount Lykaiosis the
Theisoan territory. The inhabitants of it worship most the nymph
Theisoa. There flow through the land of Theisoa the following
tributaries of the Alpheios, the Mylaon, Nus, Akhelōos, Celadus, and
Naliphus. There are two other rivers of the same name as the Akhelōos in
Arcadia, and more famous than it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.38.10">

One, falling into the sea by the Echinadian islands, flows through
Acarnania and Aetolia, and is said by Homer in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>[^524] to be the prince
of all rivers. Another Akhelōos, flowing from Mount Sipylos, along with
the mountain also, he takes occasion to mention in connection with his
account of Niobe.[^525] The third river called the Akhelōos is the one
by Mount Lykaios.

On the right of Lykosoura are the mountains called Nomian, and on them
is a sanctuary of Nomian Pan; the place they name Melpeia, saying that
here Pan discovered the music of the pipes. It is a very obvious
conjecture that the name of the Nomian Mountains is derived from the
pasturings \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomai</span>\] of
Pan, but the Arcadians themselves derive the name from a nymph.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.39.1">

By Lykosoura to the west passes the river Plataniston. No traveller can
possibly avoid crossing the Plataniston who is going to Phigalia.
Afterwards there is an ascent for some thirty stadium-lengths or so.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.39.2">

The story of Phigalus, the son of Lykaon, who was the original founder
of the city, how in course of time the city made a change and called
itself after Phialus, the son of Bucolion, and again restored its old
name, I have already set forth.[^526] Another account, but not worthy of
credit, is current, that Phigalus was not a son of Lykaon but an
aboriginal. Others have said that Phigalia was one of the nymphs called
Dryads.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.39.3">

When the Lacedaemonians attacked the Arcadians and invaded Phigalia,
they overcame the inhabitants in battle and sat down to besiege the
city. When the walls were in danger of capture the Phigalians ran away,
or perhaps the Lacedaemonians let them come out under a truce. The
taking of Phigalia and the flight of the Phigalians from it took place
when Miltiades was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the second year of the thirtieth Olympiad,[^527] when Khionis the
Laconian was victorious for the third time.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.39.4">

The Phigalians who escaped resolved to go to Delphi and ask the god
about their return. The Pythian priestess said that if they made the
attempt by themselves she saw no return for them; but if they took with
them one hundred picked men from Oresthasium, these would die in the
battle, but through them the Phigalians would be restored to their city.
When the Oresthasians heard of the oracle delivered to the Phigalians,
all vied with one another in their eagerness to be one of the picked
hundred and take part in the expedition to Phigalia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.39.5">

They advanced against the Lacedaemonian garrison and fulfilled the
oracle in all respects. For they fought and met their end gloriously;
expelling the Spartans they enabled the Phigalians to recover their
native land.Phigalia lies on high land that is for the most part
precipitous, and the walls are built on the cliffs. But on the top the
hill is level and flat. Here there is a sanctuary of Artemis Savior with
a standing image of stone. From this sanctuary it is their custom to
start their processions.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.39.6">

The image of Hermes in the gymnasium is like to one dressed in a cloak;
but the statue does not end in feet, but in the square shape. A temple
also of Dionysus is here, who by the inhabitants is surnamed
Acratophorus, but the lower part of the image cannot be seen for
laurel-leaves and ivy. As much of it as can be seen is painted … with
cinnabar to shine. It is said to be found by the Iberians along with the
gold.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.40.1">

The Phigalians have on their marketplace a statue of a competitor at the
pankration, Arrhachion; it is archaic, especially in its posture. The
feet are close together, and the arms hang down by the side as far as
the hips. The statue is made of stone, and it is said that an
inscription was written upon it. This has disappeared with time, but
Arrhachion won two Olympic victories at Festivals before the
fifty-fourth, while at this Festival[^528] he won one due partly to the
fairness of the Umpires and partly to his own manhood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.40.2">

For when he was contending for the wild olive with the last remaining
competitor, whoever he was, the latter got a grip first, and held
Arrhachion, hugging him with his legs, and at the same time he squeezed
his neck with his hands. Arrhachion dislocated his opponent’s toe, but
expired owing to suffocation; but he who suffocated Arrhachion was
forced to give in at the same time because of the pain in his toe. The
Eleians garlanded and proclaimed victor the corpse of Arrhachion.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.40.3">

I know that the Argives acted similarly in the case of Creugas, a boxer
of Epidamnus. For the Argives too gave to Creugas after his death the
garland in the Nemean games, because his opponent Damoxenos of Syracuse
broke their mutual agreement. For evening drew near as they were boxing,
and they agreed within the hearing of witnesses, that each should in
turn allow the other to deal him a blow. At that time boxers did not yet
wear a sharp thong on the wrist of each hand, but still boxed with the
soft gloves, binding them in the hollow of the hand, so that their
fingers might be left bare. These soft gloves were thin thongs of raw
ox-hide plaited together after an ancient manner.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.40.4">

On the occasion to which I refer Creugas aimed his blow at the head of
Damoxenos, and the latter ordered Creugas to lift up his arm. On his
doing so, Damoxenos with straight fingers struck his opponent under the
ribs; and what with the sharpness of his nails and the force of the blow
he drove his hand into the other’s inside, caught his bowels, and tore
them as he pulled them out.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.40.5">

Creugas expired on the spot, and the Argives expelled Damoxenos for
breaking his agreement by dealing his opponent many blows instead of
one. They gave the victory to the dead Creugas, and had a statue of him
made in Argos. It still stood in my time in the sanctuary of Lycian
Apollo.

In the marketplace of Phigalia there is also a common tomb of the picked
men of Oresthasium, and every year they sacrifice to them as to heroes.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.2">

A river called the Lymax flowing just beside Phigalia falls into the
Neda, and the river, they say, got its name from the purifying of Rhea.
For when she had given birth to Zeus, the nymphs who purified her after
her travail threw the refuse into this river. Now the ancients called
refuse “lymata.” Homer,[^529] for example, says that the Greeks were
purified, after the pestilence was stayed, and threw the lymata into the
sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.3">

The source of the Neda is on Mount Kerausias, which is a part of Mount
Lykaios. At the place where the Neda approaches nearest to Phigalia the
boys of the Phigalians cut off their hair in honor of the river. Near
the sea the Neda is navigable for small ships. Of all known rivers the
Maeander descends with the most winding course, which very often turns
back and then bends round once more; but the second place for its
twistings should be given to the Neda.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.4">

Some twelve stadium-lengths above Phigalia are hot baths, and not far
from these the Lymax falls into the Neda. Where the streams meet is the
sanctuary of Eurynome, a holy spot from of old and difficult of approach
because of the roughness of the ground. Around it are many cypress
trees, growing close together.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.5">

Eurynome is believed by the people of Phigalia to be a surname of
Artemis. Those of them, however, to whom have descended ancient
traditions, declare that Eurynome was a daughter of Okeanos, whom Homer
mentions in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>,[^530]
saying that along with Thetis she received Hephaistos. On the same day
in each year they open the sanctuary of Eurynome, but at any other time
it is a transgression for them to open it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.6">

On this occasion sacrifices also are offered by the state and by
individuals. I did not arrive at the season of the festival, and I did
not see the image of Eurynome; but the Phigalians told me that golden
chains bind the wooden image, which represents a woman as far as the
hips, but below this a fish. If she is a daughter of Okeanos, and lives
with Thetis in the depth of the sea, the fish may be regarded as a kind
of emblem of her. But there could be no probable connection between such
a shape and Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.7">

Phigalia is surrounded by mountains, on the left by the mountain called
Kotilios, while on the right is another, Mount Elaious, which acts as a
shield to the city. The distance from the city to Mount Kotilios is
about forty stadium-lengths. On the mountain is a place called Bassae,
and the temple of Apollo the Helper, which, including the roof, is of
stone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.8">

Of the temples in the Peloponnesus, this might be placed first after the
one at Tegea for the beauty of its stone and for its symmetry. Apollo
received his name from the help he gave in time of plague, just as the
Athenians gave him the name of Averter of Evil for turning the plague
away from them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.9">

It was at the time of the war between the Peloponnesians and the
Athenians that he also saved the Phigalians, and at no other time; the
evidence is that of the two surnames of Apollo, which have practically
the same meaning, and also the fact that Ictinos, the architect of the
temple at Phigalia, was a contemporary of Pericles, and built for the
Athenians what is called the Parthenon. My narrative has already said
that the tile image of Apollo is in the marketplace of Megalopolis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.41.10">

On Mount Kotilios is a spring of water, but the author who related that
this spring is the source of the stream of the river Lymax neither saw
it himself nor spoke to a man who had done so. But I did both. We saw
the river actually flowing, and the water of the spring on Mount
Kotilios running no long way, and within a short distance disappearing
altogether. It did not, however, occur to me to take pains to discover
where in Arcadia the source of the Lymax is. Beyond the sanctuary of
Apollo the Helper is a place named Cotilum, and in Cotilum is an
Aphrodite. She also has a temple, the roof of which is now gone, and an
image of the goddess.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.1">

The second mountain, Mount Elaious, is some thirty stadium-lengths away
from Phigalia, and has a cave sacred to Demeter surnamed Black. The
Phigalians accept the account of the people of Thelpusa about the mating
of Poseidon and Demeter, but they assert that Demeter gave birth, not to
a horse, but to the Mistress, as the Arcadians call her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.2">

Afterwards, they say, angry with Poseidon and grieved at the abduction
of Persephone, she put on black apparel and shut herself up in this
cavern for a long time. But when all the fruits of the earth were
perishing, and humankind was dying yet more through famine, no god, it
seemed, knew where Demeter was in hiding,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.3">

until Pan, they say, visited Arcadia. Roaming from mountain to mountain
as he hunted, he came at last to Mount Elaious and spied Demeter, the
state she was in and the clothes she wore. So Zeus learned this from
Pan, and sent the Fates to Demeter, who listened to the Fates and laid
aside her wrath, moderating her grief as well. For these reasons, the
Phigalians say, they concluded that this cavern was sacred to Demeter
and set up in it a wooden image.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.4">

The image, they say, was made after this fashion. It was seated on a
rock, like to a woman in all respects save the head. She had the head
and hair of a horse, and there grew out of her head images of serpents
and other beasts. Her tunic reached right to her feet; on one of her
hands was a dolphin, on the other a dove. Now why they had the image
made after this fashion is plain to any intelligent man who is learned
in traditions.They say that they named her Black because the goddess had
black apparel.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.5">

They cannot relate either who made this wooden image or how it caught
fire. But the old image was destroyed, and the Phigalians gave the
goddess no fresh image, while they neglected for the most part her
festivals and sacrifices, until the barrenness fell on the land. Then
they went as suppliants to the Pythian priestess and received this
response:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When the Phigalians heard the oracle that was brought back, they held
Demeter in greater honor than before, and particularly they persuaded
Onatas of Aegina, son of Mikon, to make them an image of Demeter at a
price. The Pergamenes have a bronze Apollo made by this Onatas, a most
wonderful marvel both for its size and workmanship. This man then, about
two generations after the Persian invasion of Greece, made the
Phigalians an image of bronze, guided partly by a picture or copy of the
ancient wooden image which he discovered, but mostly (so goes the story)
by a vision that he saw in dreams. As to the date, I have the following
evidence to produce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.8">

At the time when Xerxes crossed over into Europe, Gelon the son of
Deinomenes was despot of Syracuse and of the rest of Sicily besides.
When Gelon died, the kingdom devolved on his brother Hieron. Hieron died
before he could dedicate to Olympian Zeus the offerings he had vowed for
his victories in the chariot-race, and so Deinomenes his son paid the
debt for his father.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.9">

These too are works of Onatas, and there are two inscriptions at
Olympia. The one over the offering is this:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Having won victories in thy grand games, Olympian Zeus,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Once with the four-horse chariot, twice with the race-horse,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Hieron bestowed on thee these gifts: his son dedicated them,

Deinomenes, as a memorial to his Syracusan father.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.10">

The other inscription is:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Onatas, son of Mikon, fashioned me,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Who had his home in the island of Aegina.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Onatas was contemporary with Hegias of Athens and Ageladas of Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.11">

It was mainly to see this Demeter that I came to Phigalia. I offered no
burned sacrifice to the goddess, that being a custom of the natives. But
the rule for sacrifice by private persons, and at the annual sacrifice
by the community of Phigalia, is to offer grapes and other cultivated
fruits, with honeycombs and raw wool still full of its grease. These
they place on the altar built before the cave, afterwards pouring oil
over them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.12">

They have a priestess who performs the rites, and with her is the
youngest of their “sacrificers,” as they are called, who are citizens,
three in number. There is a grove of oaks around the cave, and a cold
spring rises from the earth. The image made by Onatas no longer existed
in my time, and most of the Phigalians were ignorant that it had ever
existed at all.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.42.13">

The oldest, however, of the inhabitants I met said that three
generations before his time some stones had fallen on the image out of
the roof; these crushed the image, destroying it utterly. Indeed, in the
roof I could still discern plainly where the stones had broken away.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.43.1">

My story next requires me to describe whatever is notable at Pallantion,
and the reason why the emperor Antoninus the first turned it from a
village to a city, giving its inhabitants liberty and freedom from
taxation.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.43.2">

Well, the story is that the wisest man and the best soldier among the
Arcadians was one Evander (Euandros), whose mother was a nymph, a
daughter of the Ladon, while his father was Hermes. Sent out to
establish a colony at the head of a company of Arcadians from
Pallantion, he founded a city on the banks of the river Tiber. That part
of modern Rome, which once was the home of Evander (Euandros) and the
Arcadians who accompanied him, got the name of Pallantion in memory of
the city in Arcadia. Afterwards the name was changed by omitting the
letters <span custom-style="chs_emphasis">L</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_emphasis">N</span>.[^532] These are the reasons
why the emperor bestowed boons upon Pallantion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.43.3">

Antoninus, the benefactor of Pallantion, never willingly involved the
Romans in war; but when the Moors (who form the greatest part of the
independent Libyans, being nomads, and more formidable enemies than even
the Scythians in that they wandered, not on wagons, but on horseback
with their womenfolk), when these, I say, began an unprovoked war, he
drove them from all their country, forcing them to flee to the extreme
parts of Libya, right up to Mount Atlas and to the people living on it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.43.4">

He also took away from the Brigantes in Britain the greater part of
their territory, because they too had begun an unprovoked war on the
province of Genunia, a Roman dependency. The cities of Lycia and of
Caria, along with Kos and Rhodes, were overthrown by a violent
earthquake that smote them. These cities also were restored by the
emperor Antoninus, who was keenly anxious to rebuild them, and devoted
vast sums to this task. As to his gifts of money to Greeks, and to such
barbarians as needed it, and his buildings in Greece, Ionia, Carthage,
and Syria, others have written of them most exactly.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.43.5">

But there is also another memorial of himself left by this emperor.
There was a certain law whereby provincials who were themselves of Roman
citizenship, while their children were considered of Greek nationality,
were forced either to leave their property to strangers or let it
increase the wealth of the emperor. Antoninus permitted all such to give
to the children their heritage, choosing rather to show himself
benevolent than to retain a law that swelled his riches. This emperor
the Romans called Pius, because he showed himself to be a most religious
man.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.43.6">

In my opinion he might also be justly called by the same title as the
elder Cyrus, who was styled Father of Men. He left to succeed him a son
of the same name. This Antoninus the second brought retribution both on
the Germans, the most numerous and warlike barbarians in Europe, and
also on the Sarmatian nation, both of whom had been guilty of beginning
a war of aggression.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.1">

To complete my account of Arcadia I have only to describe the road from
Megalopolis to Pallantion and Tegea, which also takes us as far as what
is called the Dyke. On this road is a suburb named Ladoceia after
Ladocus, the son of Ekhemos, and after it is the site of what was in old
times the city of Haimoniai. Its founder was Haimon the son of Lykaon,
and the name of the place has remained Haimoniai to this day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.2">

After Haimoniai on the right of the road are some noteworthy remains of
the city of Oresthasium, especially the pillars of a sanctuary of
Artemis, which still are there. The surname of Artemis is Priestess. On
the straight road from Haimoniai is a place called Aphrodisium, and
after it another, called Athenaeum. On the left of it is a temple of
Athena with a stone image in it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.3">

About twenty stadium-lengths away from Athenaeum are ruins of Asea, and
the hill that once was the citadel has traces of fortifications to this
day. Some five stadium-lengths from Asea are the sources of the Alpheios
and of the Eurotas, the former a little distance from the road, the
latter just by the road itself. Near the source of the Alpheios is a
temple of the Mother of the Gods without a roof, and two lions made of
stone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.4">

The waters of the Eurotas mingle with the Alpheios, and the united
streams flow on for some twenty stadium-lengths. Then they fall into a
chasm, and the Eurotas comes again to the surface in the Lacedaemonian
territory, the Alpheios at Pegai (Sources) in the land of Megalopolis.
From Asea is an ascent up Mount Boreios, and on the top of the mountain
are traces of a sanctuary. It is said that the sanctuary was built in
honor of Athena Savior and Poseidon by Odysseus after his return from
Troy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.5">

What is called the Dyke is the boundary between Megalopolis on the one
hand and Tegea and Pallantion on the other. The plain of Pallantion you
reach by turning aside to the left from the Dyke. In Pallantion is a
temple with two stone images, one of Pallas, the other of Evander
(Euadros). There is also a sanctuary of the Maiden, the daughter of
Demeter, and not far away is a statue of Polybius. The hill above the
city was of old used as a citadel. On the crest of the hill there still
remains a sanctuary of certain gods.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.6">

Their surname is the Pure, and here it is customary to take the most
solemn oaths. The names of the gods either they do not know, or knowing
will not divulge; but it might be inferred that they were called Pure
because Pallas did not sacrifice to them after the same fashion as his
father sacrificed to Zeus Lykaios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.7">

On the right of the so-called Dyke lies the Manthuric plain. The plain
is on the borders of Tegea, stretching just about fifty stadium-lengths
to that city. On the right of the road is a small mountain called Mount
Kresios, on which stands the sanctuary of Aphneios. For Ares, the
Tegeans say, mated with Aerope, daughter of Cepheus, the son of Aleus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.44.8">

She died in giving birth to a child, who clung to his mother even when
she was dead, and sucked great abundance of milk from her breasts. Now
this took place by the will of Ares, and because of it they name the god
Aphneios (Abundant); but the name given to the hill was, it is said,
Aeropus. There is on the way to Tegea a fountain called Leuconian. They
say that Apheidas was the father of Leucone, and not far from Tegea is
her tomb.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.45.1">

The Tegeans say that in the time of Tegeates, son of Lykaon, only the
district got its name from him, and that the inhabitants dwelled in
parishes, Gareatae, Phylacenses, Caryatae, Corythenses, Potakhidai,
Oiatai, Manthyrenses, Ekheuethenses. But in the reign of Apheidas a
ninth parish was added to them, namely Apheidantes. Of the modern city
Aleus was founder.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.45.2">

Besides the exploits shared by the Tegeans with the Arcadians, which
include the Trojan war, the Persian wars and the battle at Dipaea with
the Lacedaemonians, the Tegeans have, besides the deeds already
mentioned, the following claims of their own to fame. Ankaios, the son
of Lycurgus (Lykourgos), though wounded, stood up to the Calydonian
boar, which Atalanta shot at, being the first to hit the beast. For this
feat she received, as a prize for valor, the head and hide of the boar.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.45.3">

When the Herakleidai returned to the Peloponnesus, Ekhemos, son of
Aeropus, a Tegean, fought a duel with Hyllos, and overcame him in the
fight. The Tegeans again were the first Arcadians to overcome
Lacedaemonians; when invaded they defeated their enemies and took most
of them prisoners.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.45.4">

The ancient sanctuary of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aléā</span> was made for the
Tegeans by Aleus. Later on the Tegeans set up for the goddess a large
temple, worth seeing. The sanctuary was utterly destroyed by a fire
which suddenly broke out when Diophantos was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the second year of the ninety-sixth Olympiad, at which Eupolemos of Elis
won the foot-race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.45.5">

The modern temple is far superior to all other temples in the
Peloponnesus on many grounds, especially for its size. Its first row of
pillars is Doric, and the next to it Corinthian; also, outside the
temple, stand pillars of the Ionic order. I discovered that its
architect was Scopas the Parian, who made images in many places of
ancient Greece, and some besides in Ionia and Caria.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.45.6">

On the front gable is the hunting of the Calydonian boar. The boar
stands right in the center. On one side are Atalanta, Meleagros,
Theseus, Telamon, Peleus, Polydeukes, Iolaos, the partner in most of the
labors of Hēraklēs, and also the sons of Thestios, the brothers of
Althaea, Prothous and Cometes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.45.7">

On the other side of the boar is Epochus supporting Ankaios who is now
wounded and has dropped his axe; by his side is Castor (Kastor), with
Amphiaraos, the son of Oikles, next to whom is Hippothous, the son of
Cercyon, son of Agamedes, son of Stymphalos. The last figure is
Peirithoös. On the gable at the back is a representation of Telephus
fighting Achilles on the plain of the Kaïkos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.46.1">

The ancient image of Athena
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Aléā</span>, and with it the
tusks of the Calydonian boar, were carried away by the Roman emperor
Augustus after his defeat of Antonius and his allies, among whom were
all the Arcadians except the Mantineians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.46.2">

It is clear that Augustus was not the first to carry away from the
vanquished votive offerings and images of gods, but was only following
an old precedent. For when Troy was taken and the Greeks were dividing
up the spoils, Sthenelus the son of Capaneus was given the wooden image
of Zeus Herkeios (Of the Courtyard); and many years later, when Dorians
were migrating to Sicily, Antiphemus the founder of Gela, after the sack
of Omphace, a town of the Sicanians, removed to Gela an image made by
Daidalos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.46.3">

Xerxes, too, the son of Dareios, the king of Persias
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\], apart from
the spoil he carried away from the city of Athens, took besides, as we
know, from Brauron the image of Brauronian Artemis, and furthermore,
accusing the Milesians of cowardice in a naval engagement against the
Athenians in Greek waters, carried away from them the bronze Apollo at
Brankhidai. This it was to be the lot of Seleukos afterwards to restore
to the Milesians, but the Argives down to the present still retain the
images they took from Tiryns; one, a wooden image, is by the Hērā, the
other is kept in the sanctuary of Lycian Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.46.4">

Again, the people of Kyzikos, compelling the people of Prokonnesos by
war to live at Kyzikos, took away from Prokonnesos an image of Mother
Dindymene. The image is of gold, and its face is made of hippopotamus
teeth instead of ivory. So the emperor Augustus only followed a custom
in vogue among the Greeks and barbarians from of old. The image of
Athena Aléā at Rome is as you enter the Forum made by Augustus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.46.5">

Here then it has been set up, made throughout of ivory, the work of
Endoeus. Those in charge of the curiosities say that one of the boar’s
tusks has broken off; the remaining one is kept in the gardens of the
emperor, in a sanctuary of Dionysus, and is about half a fathom long.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.47.1">

The statue \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\]

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizein</span>\] from the

in Pentelic marble.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.47.2">

Of the votive offerings in the temple these are the most notable. There
is the hide of the Calydonian boar, rotted by age and by now altogether
without bristles. Hanging up are the fetters, except such as have been
destroyed by rust, worn by the Lacedaemonian prisoners when they dug the
plain of Tegea. There have been dedicated a sacred couch of Athena, a
portrait painting of Auge, and the shield of Marpessa, surnamed Choera,
a woman of Tegea;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.47.3">

of Marpessa I shall make mention later.[^533] The priest of Athena is a
boy; I do not know how long his priesthood lasts, but it must be before,
and not after, puberty. The altar for the goddess was made, they say, by
Melampos, the son of Amythaon. Represented on the altar are Rhea and the
nymph Oinoe holding the baby Zeus. On either side are four figures: on
one, Glauke, Neda, Theisoa and Anthracia; on the other Ide, Hagno,
Alcinoe and Phrixa. There are also images of the Muses and of Memory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.47.4">

Not far from the temple is a stadium formed by a mound of earth, where
they celebrate games, one festival called Aleaea after Athena, the other
Halotia (Capture Festival) because they captured the greater part of the
Lacedaemonians alive in the battle. To the north of the temple is a
fountain, and at this fountain they say that Auge was outraged by
Hēraklēs, therein differing from the account of Auge in Hecataeus. Some
three stadium-lengths away from the fountain is a temple of Hermes
Aipytos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.47.5">

There is at Tegea another sanctuary of Athena, namely of Athena Poliatis
(Keeper of the City) into which a priest enters once in each year. This
sanctuary they name Eryma (Defence) saying that Cepheus, the son of
Aleus, received from Athena a boon, that Tegea should never be captured
while time shall endure, adding that the goddess cut off some of the
hair of Medusa and gave it to him as a guard to the city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.47.6">

Their story about Artemis, the same as is called Leader, is as follows.
Aristomelidas, despot of Orkhomenos in Arcadia, fell in love with a
Tegean girl, and, getting her somehow or other into his power, entrusted
her to the keeping of Khronios. The girl, before she was delivered up to
the despot, killed herself for fear and shame, and Artemis in a vision
stirred up Khronios against Aristomelidas. He slew the despot, fled to
Tegea, and made a sanctuary for Artemis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.1">

The marketplace is in shape very like a brick, and in it is a temple of
Aphrodite called “in brick,” with a stone image. There are two slabs; on
one are represented in relief Antiphanes, Crisus, Tyronidas and
Pyrrhias, who made laws for the Tegeans, and down to this day receive
honors for it from them. On the other slab is represented Iasios,
holding a horse, and carrying in his right hand a branch of palm. It is
said that Iasios won a horse-race at Olympia, at the time when Hēraklēs
the Theban celebrated the Olympian festival.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.2">

The reason why at Olympia the victor receives a garland of wild-olive I
have already explained in my account of Elis;[^534] why at Delphi the
garland is of bay I shall make plain later.[^535] At the Isthmus the
pine, and at Nemeā celery became the prize to commemorate the sufferings
of Palaimon and Arkhemoros. At most games, however, is given a garland
of palm, and at all a palm is placed in the right hand of the victor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.3">

The origin of the custom is said to be that Theseus, on his return from
Crete, held games in Delos in honor of Apollo, and garlanded the victors
with palm. Such, it is said, was the origin of the custom. The palm in
Delos is mentioned by Homer in the passage[^536] where Odysseus
supplicates the daughter of Alkinoos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.4">

There is also an image of Ares in the marketplace of Tegea. Carved in
relief on a slab it is called Gynaecothoenas (He who entertains women).
At the time of the Laconian war, when Kharillos king of Lacedaemon made
the first invasion, the women armed themselves and lay in ambush under
the hill they call today Phylactris (Sentry Hill). When the armies met
and the men on either side were performing many remarkable exploits,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.5">

the women, they say, came on the scene and put the Lacedaemonians to
flight. Marpessa, surnamed Choera, surpassed, they say, the other women
in daring, while Kharillos himself was one of the Spartan prisoners. The
story goes on to say that he was set free without ransom, swore to the
Tegeans that the Lacedaemonians would never again attack Tegea, and then
broke his oath; that the women offered to Ares a sacrifice of victory on
their own account without the men, and gave to the men no share in the
meat of the victim. For this reason Ares got his surname.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.6">

There is also an altar of Zeus Teleios (Full-grown), with a square
image, a shape of which the Arcadians seem to me to be exceedingly fond.
There are also here tombs of Tegeates, the son of Lykaon, and of Maera,
the wife of Tegeates. They say that Maera was a daughter of Atlas, and
Homer makes mention of her in the passage[^537] where Odysseus tells to
Alkinoos his journey to Hades, and of those whose ghosts he beheld
there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.7">

The Tegeans surname Eileithuia, a temple of whom, with art image, they
have in their marketplace, Auge on her knees, saying that Aleus handed
over his daughter to Nauplios with the order to take and drown her in
the sea. As she was being carried along, they say, she fell on her knees
and so gave birth to her son, at the place where is the sanctuary of
Eileithuia. This story is different from another, that Auge was brought
to bed without her father’s knowing it, and that Telephus was exposed on
Mount Parthenios, the abandoned child being suckled by a deer. This
account is equally current among the people of Tegea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.48.8">

Close to the sanctuary of Eileithuia is an altar of Earth, next to which
is a slab of white marble. On this is carved Polybius, the son of
Lykortas, while on another slab is Elatos, one of the sons of Arkas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.49.1">

Not far from the marketplace is a theater, and near it are pedestals of
bronze statues, but the statues themselves no longer exist. On one
pedestal is an elegiac inscription that the statue is that of
Philopoimen. The memory of this Philopoimen is most carefully cherished
by the Greeks, both for the wisdom he showed and for his many brave
achievements.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.49.2">

His father Kraugis was as nobly born as any Arcadian of Megalopolis, but
he died while Philopoimen was still a baby, and Kleandros of Mantineia
became his guardian. This man was an exile from Mantineia, resident in
Megalopolis because of his misfortunes at home, and his house and that
of Kraugis had ties of guest-friendship. Among the teachers of
Philopoimen, they say, were Megalophanes and Ecdelus, pupils, it is
said, of Arkesilaos of Pitane.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.49.3">

In size and strength of body no Peloponnesian was his superior, but he
was ugly of countenance. He scorned training for the prizes of the
games, but he worked the land he owned and did not neglect to clear it
of wild beasts. They say that he read books of scholars of repute among
the Greeks, stories of wars, and all that taught him anything of
strategy. He wished to model his whole life on Epameinondas, his wisdom
and his achievements, but could not rise to his height in every respect.
For the temper of Epameinondas was calm and, in particular, free from
anger, but the Arcadian was somewhat passionate.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.49.4">

When Megalopolis was captured by Kleomenes, Philopoimen was not dismayed
by the unexpected disaster, but led safely to Messene about two-thirds
of the men of military age, along with the women and children, the
Messenians being at that time friendly allies. To some of those who made
good their escape Kleomenes offered terms, saying that he was beginning
to repent his crime, and would treat with the Megalopolitans if they
returned home; but Philopoimen induced the citizens at a meeting to win
a return home by force of arms, and to refuse to negotiate or make a
truce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.49.5">

When the battle had joined with the Lacedaemonians under Kleomenes at
Sellasia,[^538] in which Achaeans and Arcadians from all the cities took
part, along with Antigonos at the head of a Macedonian army, Philopoimen
served with the cavalry. But when he saw that the infantry would be the
decisive factor in the engagement, he voluntarily fought on foot, showed
conspicuous daring, and was pierced through both thighs by one of the
enemy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.49.6">

Although so seriously impeded, he bent in his knees and forced himself
forward, so that he actually broke the spear by the movement of his
legs. After the defeat of the Lacedaemonians under Kleomenes,
Philopoimen returned to the camp, where the surgeons pulled out from one
thigh the spike, from the other the blade. When Antigonos learned of his
valor and saw it, he was anxious to take Philepoimen to Macedonia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.49.7">

But Philopoimen was not likely to care much about Antigonos. Sailing
across to Crete, where a civil war was raging, he put himself at the
head of a band of mercenaries. Going back to Megalopolis, he was at once
chosen by the Achaeans to command the cavalry, and he turned them into
the finest cavalry in Greece. In the battle at the river Larisus between
the Achaeans with their allies and the Eleians with the Aetolians,[^539]
who were helping the Eleians on grounds of kinship, Philopoimen first
killed with his own hand Demophantos, the leader of the opposing
cavalry, and then turned to flight all the mounted troops of Aetolia and
Elis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.1">

As the Achaeans now turned their gaze on Philopoimen and placed in him
all their hopes, he succeeded in changing the equipment of those serving
in their infantry. They had been carrying short javelins and oblong
shields after the fashion of the Celtic “door” or the “wicker” of the
Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\].[^540]
Philopoimen, however, persuaded them to put on breast-plates and
greaves, and also to use Argolic shields[^541] and long spears.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.2">

When Makhanidas the upstart became despot of Lacedaemon, and war began
once again between that city under Makhanidas and the Achaeans,
Philopoimen commanded the Achaean forces. A battle took place at
Mantineia. The light troops of the Lacedaemonians overcame the
light-armed of the Achaeans, and Makhanidas pressed hard on the
fugitives. Philopoimen, however, with the phalanx of infantry put to
flight the Lacedaemonian men-at-arms, met Makhanidas returning from the
pursuit and killed him. The Lacedaemonians were unfortunate in the
battle, but their good fortune more than compensated for their defeat,
for they were delivered from their despot.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.3">

Not long afterwards the Argives celebrated the Nemean games, and
Philopoimen chanced to be present at the competition of the harpists.
Pylades, a man of Megalopolis, the most famous harpist of his time, who
had won a Pythian victory, was then singing the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Persians</span>, an ode of Timotheus
the Milesian. When he had begun the song:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Who to Greece gives the great and glorious jewel of freedom,”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Timotheus, unknown location

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

the audience of Greeks looked at Philopoimen and by their clapping
signified that the song applied to him. I am told that a similar thing
happened to Themistocles at Olympia, for the audience there rose to do
him honor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.4">

But Philip, the son of Demetrios, king of Macedonia, who poisoned Aratos
of Sikyon, sent men to Megalopolis with orders to murder Philopoimen.
The attempt failed, and Philip incurred the hatred of all Greece.The
Thebans had defeated the Megarians in battle, and were already climbing
the wall of Megara, when the Megarians deceived them into thinking that
Philopoimen had come to Megara. This made the Thebans so cautious that
they went away home, and abandoned their military operation.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.5">

In Lacedaemon another despot arose, Nabis, and the first of the
Peloponnesians to be attacked by him were the Messenians. Coming upon
them by night, when they by no means were expecting an assault, he took
the city except the citadel; but when on the morrow Philopoimen arrived
with an army, he evacuated Messene under a truce.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.6">

When Philopoimen’s term of office as general expired, and others were
chosen to be generals of the Achaeans, he again crossed to Crete and
sided with the Gortynians, who were hard pressed in war. The Arcadians
were angry with him for his absence; so he returned from Crete and found
that the Romans had begun a war against Nabis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.7">

The Romans had equipped a fleet against Nabis, and Philopoimen was too
enthusiastic to keep out of the quarrel. But being entirely ignorant of
nautical affairs he unwittingly embarked on a leaky trireme, so that the
Romans and their allies were reminded of the verses of Homer, where in
the Catalogue[^542] he remarks on the ignorance of the Arcadians of
nautical matters.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.8">

A few days after the sea-fight, Philopoimen and his band, waiting for a
moonless night, burned down the camp of the Lacedaemonians at Gythium.
Thereupon Nabis caught Philopoimen himself and the Arcadians with him in
a disadvantageous position. The Arcadians, though few in number, were
good soldiers,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.9">

and Philopoimen, by changing the order of his line of retreat, caused
the strongest positions to be to his advantage and not to that of his
enemy. He overcame Nabis in the battle and massacred during the night
many of the Lacedaemonians, so raising yet higher his reputation among
the Greeks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.50.10">

After this Nabis secured from the Romans a truce for a fixed period, but
died before this period came to an end, being assassinated by a man of
Calydon, who pretended that he had come about an alliance,[^543] but was
in reality an enemy who had been sent for this very purpose of
assassination by the Aetolians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.1">

At this time Philopoimen flung himself into Sparta and forced her to
join the Achaean League. Shortly afterwards Titus, the Roman commander
in Greece, and Diophanes, the son of Diaios, a Megalopolitan who had
been elected general of the Achaeans, attacked Lacedaemon, accusing the
Lacedaemonians of rebellion against the Romans. But Philopoimen, though
at the time holding no office, shut the gates against them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.2">

For this reason, and because of his courage shown against both the
despots, the Lacedaemonians offered him the house[^544] of Nabis, worth
more than a hundred talents. But he scorned the wealth, and ordered the
Lacedaemonians to court with gifts, not himself, but those who could
persuade the many in the meeting of the Achaeans—a suggestion, it is
said, directed against Timolaos. He was again appointed general of the
Achaeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.3">

At this time the Lacedaemonians were involved in civil war, and
Philopoimen expelled from the Peloponnesus three hundred who were
chiefly responsible for the civil war, sold some three thousand Helots,
razed the walls of Sparta, and forbade the youths to train in the manner
laid down by the laws of Lycurgus (Lykourgos), ordering them to follow
the training of the Achaean youths. The Romans, in course of time,[^545]
were to restore to the Lacedaemonians the discipline of their native
land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.4">

When the Romans under Manius defeated at Thermopylae Antiokhos the
descendant of Seleukos, named Nicator, and the Syrian army with him,
Aristainos of Megalopolis advised the Achaeans to approve the wishes of
the Romans in all respects, and to oppose them in nothing. Philopoimen
looked angrily at Aristainos, and said that he was hastening on the doom
of Greece. Manius wished the Lacedaemonian exiles to return, but
Philopoimen opposed his plan, and only when Manius had gone away did he
allow the exiles to be restored.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.5">

But, nevertheless, Philopoimen too was to be punished for his pride.
After being appointed commander of the Achaeans for the eighth time, he
reproached a man of no little distinction for having been captured alive
by the enemy. Now at this time the Achaeans had a grievance against the
Messenians, and Philopoimen, despatching Lykortas with the army to lay
waste the land of the Messenians, was very anxious two or three days
later, in spite of his seventy years and a severe attack of fever, to
take his share in the expedition of Lykortas. He led about sixty
horsemen and targeteers.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.6">

Lykortas, however, and his army were already on their way back to their
country, having neither suffered great harm nor inflicted it on the
Messenians. Philopoimen, wounded in the head during the battle, fell
from his horse and was taken alive to Messene. A meeting of the assembly
was immediately held, at which the most widely divergent opinions were
expressed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.7">

Deinokrates, and all the Messenians whose wealth made them influential,
urged that Philopoimen should be put to death; but the popular party
were keen on saving his life, calling him Father, and more than
Father,[^546] of all the Greek people. But Deinokrates, after all, and
in spite of Messenian opposition, was to bring about the death of
Philopoimen, for he sent poison in to him.[^547]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.51.8">

Shortly afterwards Lykortas gathered a force from Arcadia and Achaea and
marched against Messene. The Messenian populace at once went over to the
side of the Arcadians, and those responsible for the death of
Philopoimen were caught and punished, all except Deinokrates, who
perished by his own hand. The Arcadians also brought back to Megalopolis
the bones of Philopoimen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.52.1">

After this Greece ceased to bear good men. For Miltiades, the son of
Kimon, overcame in battle the barbarian invaders who had landed at
Marathon, stayed the advance of the Persian army,[^548] and so became
the first benefactor of all Greece, just as Philopoimen, the son of
Kraugis, was the last. Those who before Miltiades accomplished brilliant
deeds, Kodros, the son of Melanthos, Polydoros the Spartan, Aristomenes
the Messenian, and all the rest, will be seen to have helped each his
own country and not Greece as a whole.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.52.2">

Later than Miltiades, Leonidas, the son of Anaxandrides, and
Themistocles, the son of Neokles, repulsed Xerxes from Greece,[^549]
Themistocles by the two sea-fights, Leonidas by the action at
Thermopylae. But Aristeides the son of Lysimakhos, and Pausanias, the
son of Kleombrotos,[^550] commanders at Plataea, were debarred from
being called benefactors of Greece, Pausanias by his subsequent sins,
Aristeides by his imposition of tribute on the island Greeks; for before
Aristeides all the Greeks were immune from tribute.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.52.3">

Xanthippos, the son of Ariphron, with Leotykhides the king of Sparta
destroyed the Persian fleet at Mykale,[^551] and with Kimon accomplished
many enviable achievements on behalf of the Greeks. But those who took
part in the Peloponnesian war against Athens, especially the most
distinguished of them, might be said to be murderers, almost wreckers,
of Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.52.4">

When the Greek nation was reduced to a miserable condition, it recovered
under the efforts of Konon,[^552] the son of Timotheus, and of
Epameinondas, the son of Polymnis, who drove out the Lacedaemonian
garrisons and governors, and put down the boards of ten,[^553] Konon
from the islands and coasts, Epameinondas from the cities of the
interior. By founding cities too, of no small fame, Messene and Arcadian
Megalopolis, Epameinondas made Greece more famous.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.52.5">

I reckon Leosthenes also and Aratos benefactors of all the Greeks.
Leosthenes, in spite of Alexander’s opposition, brought back safe by sea
to Greece the force of Greek mercenaries in Persia
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en Persais</span>\], about
fifty thousand in number, who had descended to the coast. As for Aratos,
I have related his exploits in my history of Sikyon.[^554]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.52.6">

The inscription on the statue of Philopoimen at Tegea runs thus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“The valor and glory of this man are famed throughout Greece, who worked

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Many achievements by might and many by his counsels,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Philopoimen, the Arcadian spearman, whom great renown attended,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When he commanded the lances in war.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Witness are two trophies, won from the despots

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Of Sparta; the swelling flood of slavery he stayed.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Wherefore did Tegea set up in stone the great-hearted son of Kraugis,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Author of blameless freedom.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.1">

Such is the inscription at Tegea on Philopoimen. The images of Apollo,
Lord of Streets, the Tegeans say they set up for the following reason.
Apollo and Artemis, they say, throughout every land visited with
punishment all the men of that time who, when Leto was with child and in
the course of her wanderings, took no heed of her when she came to their
land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.2">

So when the divinities came to the land of Tegea, Scephrus, they say,
the son of Tegeates, came to Apollo and had a private conversation with
him. And Leimon, who also was a son of Tegeates, suspecting that the
conversation of Scephrus contained a charge against him, rushed on his
brother and killed him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.3">

Immediate punishment for the murder overtook Leimon, for he was shot by
Artemis. At the time Tegeates and Maera sacrificed to Apollo and
Artemis, but afterwards a severe famine fell on the land, and an oracle
of Delphi ordered a mourning for Scephrus. At the feast of the Lord of
Streets rites are performed in honor of Scephrus, and in particular the
priestess of Artemis pursues a man, pretending she is Artemis herself
pursuing Leimon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.4">

It is also said that all the surviving sons of Tegeates, namely, Cydon,
Arkhedios and Gortys, migrated of their own free will to Crete, and that
after them were named the cities Kydonia, Gortyna and Catreus. The
Cretans dissent from the account of the Tegeans, saying that Cydon was a
son of Hermes and of Acacallis, daughter of Minos, that Catreus was a
son of Minos, and Gortys a son of Rhadamanthys.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.5">

As to Rhadamanthys himself, Homer says, in the talk of Proteus with
Menelaos,[^555] that Menelaos would go to the Elysian plain, but that
Rhadamanthys was already arrived there. Cinaethon too in his poem
represents Rhadamanthys as the son of Hephaistos, Hephaistos as a son of
Talos, and Talos as a son of Kres. The stories
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logoi</span>\] of the Greeks
generally have different forms, and this is particularly true of
genealogy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.6">

At Tegea the images of the Lord of Streets are four in number, one set
up by each of the tribes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulai</span>\]. The names
given to the tribes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phulai</span>\] are Clareotis,
Hippothoetis, Apolloniatis, and Athaneatis; they are called after the
lots cast by Arkas to divide the land among his sons, and after
Hippothous, the son of Cercyon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.7">

There is also at Tegea a temple of Demeter and the Maiden, whom they
surname the Fruit-bringers, and hard by is one of Aphrodite called
Paphian. The latter was built by Laodice, who was descended, as I have
already said,[^556] from Agapenor, who led the Arcadians to Troy, and it
was in Paphos that she dwelled. Not far from it are two sanctuaries of
Dionysus, an altar of the Maiden, and a temple of Apollo with a gilded
image.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.8">

The artist was Kheirisophos; he was a Cretan by lineage, but his date
and teacher we do not know. The residence of Daidalos with Minos at
Knossos secured for the Cretans a reputation for the making of wooden
images also, which lasted for a long period. By the Apollo stands
Kheirisophos in stone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.9">

The Tegeans also have what they call a Common Hearth of the Arcadians.
Here there is an image of Hēraklēs, and on his thigh is represented a
wound received in the first fight with the sons of Hippocoön. The lofty
place, on which are most of the altars of the Tegeans, is called the
place of Zeus Klarios (Of Lots), and it is plain that the god got his
surname from the lots cast for the sons of Arkas. Here the Tegeans
celebrate a feast every year.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.10">

It is said that once at the time of the feast they were invaded by the
Lacedaemonians. As it was snowing, these were chilled, and thus
distressed by their armor, but the Tegeans, without their enemies
knowing it, lighted a fire. So untroubled by the cold they donned, they
say, their armor, went out against the Lacedaemonians, and had the
better of the engagement. I also saw in Tegea the house of Aleus, the
tomb of Ekhemos, and the fight between Ekhemos and Hyllos carved in
relief upon a slab.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.53.11">

On the left of the road as you go from Tegea to Laconia there is an
altar of Pan, and likewise one of Zeus Lykaios. The foundations, too, of
sanctuaries are still there. These altars are two stadium-lengths from
the wall; and about seven stadium-lengths farther on is a sanctuary of
Artemis, surnamed Lady of the Lake, with an image of ebony. The fashion
of the workmanship is what the Greeks call Aeginetan. Some ten
stadium-lengths farther on are the ruins of a temple of Artemis
Cnaceatis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.54.1">

The boundary between the territories of Lacedaemon and Tegea is the
river Alpheios. Its water begins in Phylace, and not far from its source
there flows down into it another water from springs that are not large,
but many in number, whence the place has received the name Symbola
(Meetings).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.54.2">

It is known that the Alpheios differs from other rivers in exhibiting
this natural peculiarity; it often disappears beneath the earth to
reappear again. So flowing on from Phylace and the place called Symbola
it sinks into the Tegean plain; rising at Asea, and mingling its stream
with the Eurotas, it sinks again into the earth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.54.3">

Coming up at the place called by the Arcadians Pegai (Springs), and
flowing past the land of Pisa and past Olympia, it falls into the sea
above Cyllene, the port of Elis. Not even the Adriatic could check its
flowing onwards, but passing through it, so large and stormy a sea, it
shows in Ortygia, before Syracuse, that it is the Alpheios, and unites
its water with Arethousa.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.54.4">

The

straight road from Tegea to Thyrea and to the villages its territory
contains can show a notable sight in the tomb of Orestes, the son of
Agamemnon; from here, say the Tegeans, a Spartan stole his bones. In our
time the tomb is no longer within the gates. By the road flows also the
river Garates. Crossing the Garates and advancing ten stadium-lengths
you come to a sanctuary of Pan, by which is an oak, like the sanctuary
sacred to Pan.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.54.5">

The road from Tegea to Argos is very well suited for carriages, in fact
a first-rate highway. On the road come first a temple and image of
Asklepios. Next, turning aside to the left for about a stadium-length,
you see a dilapidated sanctuary of Apollo surnamed Pythian which is
utterly in ruins. Along the straight road there are many oaks, and in
the grove of oaks is a temple of Demeter called “in Corythenses.” Hard
by is another sanctuary, that of Mystic Dionysus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.54.6">

At this point begins Mount Parthenios. On it is shown a sacred enclosure
of Telephus, where it is said that he was exposed when a child and was
suckled by a deer. A little farther on is a sanctuary of Pan, where
Athenians and Tegeans agree that he appeared to Philippides and
conversed with him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:8.54.7">

Mount Parthenios rears also tortoises most suitable for the making of
harps; but the men on the mountain are always afraid to capture them,
and will not allow strangers to do so either, thinking them to be sacred
to Pan. Crossing the peak of the mountain you are within the cultivated
area, and reach the boundary between Tegea and Argos; it is near
Hysiaiin Argolis.These are the divisions of the Peloponnesus, the cities
in the divisions, and the most noteworthy things in each city.

</div>

## Scroll IX. Boeotia

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.1">

Boeotia borders on Attica at several places, one of which is where
Plataea touches Eleutherai. The Boeotians as a lineage got their name
from Boiotos, who, they say, was the son of Itonos and the nymph
Melanippe, and Itonos was the son of Amphiktyon. The cities are called
in some cases after men, but in most after women. The Plataeans were
originally, in my opinion, sprung from the soil; their name comes from
Plataea, whom they consider to be a daughter of the river Asopos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.2">

It is clear that the Plataeans too were of old ruled by kings; for
everywhere in Greece in ancient times, kingship and not democracy was
the established form of government. But the Plataeans know of no king
except Asopos and Cithaeron before him, holding that the latter gave his
name to the mountain, the former to the river. I think that Plataea
also, after whom the city is named, was a daughter of King Asopos, and
not of the river.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.3">

Before the battle that the Athenians fought at Marathon, the Plataeans
had no claim to renown. But they were present at the battle of Marathon,
and later, when Xerxes came down to the sea, they bravely manned the
fleet with the Athenians, and defended themselves in their own country
against the general of Xerxes, Mardonios, the son of Gobryas. Twice it
was their fate to be driven from their homes and to be taken back to
Boeotia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.4">

For in the war between the Peloponnesians and Athens, the Lacedaemonians
reduced Plataea by siege, but it was restored[^557] during the peace
made by the Spartan Antalkidas between the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] and the
Greeks, and the Plataeans returned from Athens. But a second disaster
was destined to befall them. There was no open war between Plataea and
Thebes; in fact the Plataeans declared that the peace with them still
held, because when the Lacedaemonians seized the Kadmeia they had no
part either in the plan or in the performance.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.5">

But the Thebans maintained that as the Lacedaemonians had themselves
made the peace and then broken it, all alike, in their view, were freed
from its terms. The Plataeans, therefore, looked upon the attitude of
the Thebans with suspicion, and maintained strict watch over their city.
They did not go either daily to the fields at some distance from the
city, but, knowing that the Thebans were accustomed to conduct their
assemblies with every voter present, and at the same time to prolong
their discussions, they waited for their assemblies to be called, and
then, even those whose farms lay farthest away, looked after their lands
at their leisure.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.6">

But Neokles, who was at the time Boeotarch at Thebes, not being unaware
of the Plataean trick, proclaimed that every Theban should attend the
assembly armed, and at once proceeded to lead them, not by the direct
way from Thebes across the plain, but along the road to Hysiaiin the
direction of Eleutherai and Attica, where not even a scout had been
placed by the Plataeans, being due to reach the walls about noon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.7">

The Plataeans, thinking that the Thebans were holding an assembly, were
afield and cut off from their gates. With those caught within the city
the Thebans came to terms, allowing them to depart before sundown, the
men with one garment each, the women with two. What happened to the
Plataeans on this occasion was the reverse of what happened to them
formerly when they were taken by the Lacedaemonians under Arkhidamos.
For the Lacedaemonians reduced them by preventing them from getting out
of the city, building a double line of circumvallation; the Thebans on
this occasion by preventing them from getting within their walls.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.1.8">

The second capture of Plataea occurred two years before the battle of
Leuktra,[^558] when Asteios was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens. The
Thebans destroyed all the city except the sanctuaries, but the method of
its capture saved the lives of all the Plataeans alike, and on their
expulsion they were again received by the Athenians. When Philip after
his victory at Khaironeia introduced a garrison into Thebes, one of the
means he employed to bring the Thebans low was to restore the Plataeans
to their homes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.2.1">

On Mount Cithaeron, within the territory of Plataea, if you turn off to
the right for a little way from the straight road, you reach the ruins
of Hysiaiand Erythrai. Once they were cities of Boeotia, and even at the
present day among the ruins of Hysiaiare a half-finished temple of
Apollo and a sacred well. According to the Boeotian story oracles were
obtained of old from the well by drinking of it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.2.2">

Returning to the highway you again see on the right a tomb, said to be
that of Mardonios. It is agreed that the body of Mardonios was not seen
again after the battle, but there is not a similar agreement as to the
person who gave it burial. It is admitted that Artontes, son of
Mardonios, gave many gifts to Dionysophanes the Ephesian, but also that
he gave them to others of the Ionians, in recognition that they too had
spent some pains on the burial of Mardonios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.2.3">

This road leads to Plataea from Eleutherai. On the road from Megara
there is a spring on the right, and a little farther on a rock. It is
called the bed of Actaeon, for it is said that he slept thereon when
weary with hunting, and that into this spring he looked while Artemis
was bathing in it. Stesichorus of Himera says that the goddess cast a
deer-skin round Actaeon to make sure that his hounds would kill him, so
as to prevent his taking Semele to wife.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.2.4">

My own view is that without divine interference the hounds of Actaeon
were smitten with madness, and so they were sure to tear to pieces
without distinction everybody they chanced to meet. Whereabouts on
Cithaeron the disaster befell Pentheus, the son of Echion, or where
Oedipus was exposed at birth, nobody knows with the assurance with which
we know the Cleft Road to Phokis, where Oedipus killed his father (Mount
Cithaeron is sacred to Cithaeronian Zeus), as I shall tell of[^559] at
greater length when this place in my story has been reached.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.2.5">

Roughly at the entrance into Plataea are the tombs of those who fought
against the Persians. Of the Greeks generally there is a common tomb,
but the Lacedaemonians and Athenians who fell have separate tombs, on
which are written elegiac verses by Simonides. Not far from the common
tomb of the Greeks is an altar of Zeus, God of Freedom.This then is of
bronze, but the altar and the image he made of white marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.2.6">

Even at the present day they hold every four years games called
Eleutheria (Of Freedom), in which great prizes are offered for running.
The competitors run in armor before the altar. The trophy which the
Greeks set up for the battle at Plataea stands about fifteen
stadium-lengths from the city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.2.7">

Advancing in the city itself from the altar and the image which have
been made to Zeus of Freedom, you come to a hero-shrine of Plataea. The
things-that-are-said
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legomena</span>\] about her,
and what I think is likely
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikós</span>\], I have
already[^560] said. There is at Plataea a temple of Hērā, worth seeing
for its size and for the beauty of its images. On entering you see Rhea
carrying to Kronos the stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, as though it
were the babe to which she had given birth. The Hērā they call
Full-grown; it is an upright image of huge size. Both figures are of
Pentelic marble, and the artist was Praxiteles. Here too is another
image of Hērā; it is seated, and was made by Kallimakhos. The goddess
they call the Bride for the following reason.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.1">

Hērā, they say, was for some reason or other angry with Zeus, and had
retreated to Euboea. Zeus, failing to make her change her mind, visited
Cithaeron, at that time despot in Plataea, who surpassed all men for his
cleverness. So he ordered Zeus to make an image of wood, and to carry
it, wrapped up, in a bullock wagon, and to say that he was celebrating
his marriage with Plataea, the daughter of Asopos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.2">

So Zeus followed the advice of Cithaeron. Hērā heard the news at once,
and at once appeared on the scene. But when she came near the wagon and
tore away the dress from the image, she was pleased at the deceit, on
finding it a wooden image and not a bride, and was reconciled to Zeus.
To commemorate this reconciliation they celebrate a festival called
Daidala, because the men of old time gave the name of daedala to wooden
images. My own view is that this name was given to wooden images before
Daidalos, the son of Palamaon, was born in Athens, and that he did not
receive this name at birth, but that it was a surname afterwards given
him from the daedala.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.3">

So the Plataeans hold the festival of the Daidala every six years,
according to the local guide, but really at a shorter interval. I wanted
very much to calculate exactly the interval between one Daidala and the
next, but I was unable to do so. In this way they celebrate the feast.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.4">

Not far from Alalcomenae is a grove of oaks. Here the trunks of the oaks
are the largest in Boeotia. To this grove come the Plataeans, and lay
out portions of boiled flesh. They keep a strict watch on the crows
which flock to them, but they are not troubled at all about the other
birds. They mark carefully the tree on which a crow settles with the
meat he has seized. They cut down the trunk of the tree on which the
crow has settled, and make of it the daedalum; for this is the name that
they give to the wooden image also.

This feast the Plataeans celebrate by themselves, calling it the Little
Daidala, but the Great Daidala, which is shared with them by the
Boeotians, is a festival held at intervals of fifty-nine years, for that
is the period during which, they say, the festival could not be held, as
the Plataeans were in exile. There are fourteen wooden images ready,
having been provided each year at the Little Daidala.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.6">

Lots are cast for them by the people of Plataea, Korōnē, Thespiai,
Tanagra, Khairōneia, Orkhomenos, Lebadeia, and Thebes; for at the time
when Kassandros, the son of Antipatros, rebuilt Thebes, the Thebans
wished to be reconciled with the people of Plataea, to share in the
common assembly, and to send a sacrifice to the Daidala. The towns of
less account pool their funds for images.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.7">

Bringing the image to the Asopos, and setting it upon a wagon, they
place a bridesmaid also on the wagon. They again cast lots for the
position they are to hold in the procession. After this they drive the
wagons from the river to the summit of Cithaeron. On the peak of the
mountain an altar has been prepared, which they make after the following
way. They fit together quadrangular pieces of wood, putting them
together just as if they were making a stone building, and having raised
it to a height they place brushwood upon the altar.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.8">

The cities with their magistrates sacrifice severally a cow to Hērā and
a bull to Zeus, burning on the altar the victims, full of wine and
incense, along with the daedala. Rich people, as individuals, sacrifice
what they wish; but the less wealthy sacrifice the smaller cattle; all
the victims alike are burned. The fire seizes the altar and the victims
as well, and consumes them all together. I know of no blaze that is so
high, or seen so far as this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.3.9">

About fifteen stadium-lengths below the peak, on which they make the
altar, is a cave of the Cithaeronian nymphs. It is named Sphragidium,
and the story is that of old the nymphs gave oracles in this place.

</div>

{9.4.1.} The Plataeans have also a sanctuary of Athena surnamed Warlike;
it was built from the spoils given them by the Athenians as their share
from the battle of Marathon. It is a wooden image gilded, but the face,
hands and feet are of Pentelic marble. In size it is but little smaller
than the bronze Athena on the Acropolis, the one which the Athenians
also erected as first-fruits of the battle at Marathon; the Plataeans
too had Pheidias for the maker of their image of Athena.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.4.2">

In the temple are paintings: one of them, by Polygnotus, represents
Odysseus after he has killed the wooers; the other, painted by Onasias,
is the former expedition of the Argives, under Adrastos, against Thebes.
These paintings are on the walls of the fore-temple, while at the feet
of the image is a portrait of Arimnestos, who commanded the Plataeans at
the battle against Mardonios, and yet before that at Marathon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.4.3">

There is also at Plataea a sanctuary of Demeter, surnamed Eleusinian,
and a tomb of Leitos, who was the only one to return home of the chiefs
who led Boeotians to Troy. The spring Gargaphia was filled in by the
Persian cavalry under Mardonios, because the Greek army encamped against
them got therefrom their drinking-water. Afterwards, however, the
Plataeans recovered the water.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.4.4">

On the road from Plataea to Thebes is the river Oiroe, said to have been
a daughter of the Asopos. Before crossing the Asopos, if you turn aside
to lower ground in a direction parallel to the river, after about forty
stadium-lengths you come to the ruins of Scolus. The temple of Demeter
and the Maiden among the ruins is not finished, and only half-finished
are the images of the goddesses. Even today the Asopos is the boundary
between Thebes and Plataea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.1">

The first to occupy the land of Thebes are said to have been the
Ectenes, whose king was Ogygus, an aboriginal. From his name is derived
Ogygian, which is an epithet of Thebes used by most of the poets. The
Ectenes perished, they say, by pestilence, and after them there settled
in the land the Hyantes and the Aones, who I think were Boeotian tribes
and not foreigners.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.2">

When the Phoenician army under Kadmos invaded the land these tribes were
defeated; the Hyantes fled from the land when night came, but the Aones
begged for mercy, and were allowed by Kadmos to remain and unite with
the Phoenicians. The Aones still lived in village communities, but
Kadmos built the city which even at the present day is called Kadmeia.
Afterwards the city grew, and so the Kadmeia became the citadel of the
lower city of Thebes. Kadmos made a brilliant marriage, if, as the Greek
story \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] has it,
he indeed took to wife a daughter of Aphrodite and Ares. His daughters
too have made him a name; Semele was famed for having a child by Zeus,
Ino for being a divinity of the sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.3">

In the time of Kadmos, the greatest power, next after his, was in the
hands of the Spartoi, namely, Khthonios, Hyperenor, Pelorus and Oudaios;
but it was Ekhion who, for his great valor, was preferred by Kadmos to
be his son-in-law. As I was unable to discover anything new about these
men, I adopt the story that makes their name result from the way in
which they came into being. When Kadnios migrated to the Illyrian tribe
of the Encheleans, Polydoros his son got the kingdom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.4">

Now Pentheus the son of Echion was also powerful by reason of his noble
birth and friendship with the king. Being a man of insolent character
who had shown impiety to Dionysus, he was punished by the god. Polydoros
had a son, Labdacus. When Polydoros was about to die, Labdacus was still
a child, and so he was entrusted, along with the government, to the care
of Nycteus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.5">

The sequel of this story, how Nycteus died, and how the care of the boy
with the sovereignty of Thebes devolved on Lykos, the brother of
Nycteus, I have already set forth in my account of Sikyon.[^561] When
Labdacus grew up, Lykos handed over to him the reins of government; but
Labdacus too died shortly afterwards, and Lykos again became guardian,
this time to Laios, the son of Labdacus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.6">

While Lykos was regent for the second time, Amphion and Zethus gathered
a force and came back to Thebes. Laios was secretly removed by such as
were anxious that the lineage of Kadmos should not be forgotten by
posterity, and Lykos was overcome in the fighting by the sons of
Antiope. When they succeeded to the throne they added the lower city to
the Cadmeia, giving it, because of their kinship to Thebe, the name of
Thebes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.7">

What I have said is confirmed by what Homer says in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Who first laid the foundation of seven-gated Thebe,

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 11.263

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Homer, however, makes no mention in his poetry of Amphion’s singing, and
how he built the wall to the music of his harp. Amphion won fame for his
music, learning from the Lydians themselves the Lydian mode, because of
his relationship to Tantalos, and adding three strings to the four old
ones.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.8">

The writer of the poem on Europa says that Amphion was the first
harpist, and that Hermes was his teacher. He also says that Amphion’s
songs drew even stones and beasts after him. Myro of Byzantium, a
poetess who wrote epic and elegiac poetry, states that Amphion was the
first to set up an altar to Hermes, and for this reason was presented by
him with a harp. It is also said that Amphion is punished in Hades for
being among those who made a mock of Leto and her children.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.9">

The punishment of Amphion is dealt with in the epic poem
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Minyad</span>, which treats both of
Amphion and also of Thamyris of Thrace. The houses of both Amphion and
Zethus were visited by bereavement; Amphion’s was left desolate by
plague, and the son of Zethus was killed through some mistake or other
of his mother. Zethus himself died of a broken heart, and so Laios was
restored by the Thebans to the kingdom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.10">

When Laios was king and married to Iocasta, an oracle came from Delphi
that, if Iocasta bore a child, Laios would meet his death at his son’s
hands. Whereupon Oedipus was exposed, who was fated when he grew up to
kill his father; he also married his mother. But I do not think that he
had children by her; my witness is Homer, who says in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.11">

“And I saw the mother of Oedipodes, fair Epicaste,

How could they “have made it known forthwith,” if Epicaste had borne
four children to Oedipus? But the mother of these children was
Euryganeia, daughter of Hyperphas. Among the proofs of this are the
words of the author of the poem called the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Oedipodia</span>; and moreover,
Onasias painted a picture at Plataea of Euryganeia bowed with grief
because of the fight between her children.

Polyneikes retired from Thebes while Oedipus was still alive and
reigning, in fear lest the curses of the father should be brought to
pass upon the sons. He went to Argos and married a daughter of Adrastos,
but returned to Thebes, being fetched by Eteokles after the death of
Oedipus. On his return he quarrelled with Eteokles, and so went into
exile a second time. He begged Adrastos to give him a force to effect
his return, but lost his army and fought a duel with Eteokles as the
result of a challenge.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.13">

Both fell in the duel, and the kingdom devolved on Laodamas, son of
Eteokles; Creon, the son of Menoeceus, was in power as regent and
guardian of Laodamas. When the latter had grown up and held the
kingship, the Argives led their army for the second time against Thebes.
The Thebans encamped over against them at Glisas. When they joined in
battle, Aigialeus, the son of Adrastos, was killed by Laodamas but the
Argives were victorious in the fight, and Laodamas, with any Theban
willing to accompany him, withdrew when night came to Illyria.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.14">

The Argives captured Thebes and handed it over to Thersandros, son of
Polyneikes. When the expedition under Agamemnon against Troy mistook its
course and the reverse in Mysia occurred, Thersandros too met his death
at the hands of Telephus. He had shown himself the bravest Greek at the
battle; his tomb, the stone in the open part of the marketplace, is in
the city Elaea on the way to the plain of the Kaïkos, and the natives
say that they sacrifice to him as to a hero.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.15">

On the death of Thersandros, when a second expedition was being mustered
to fight Alexander at Troy, Peneleos was chosen to command it, because
Tisamenus, the son of Thersandros, was not yet old enough. When Peneleos
was killed by Eurypylos, the son of Telephus, Tisamenus was chosen king,
who was the son of Thersandros and of Demonassa, the daughter of
Amphiaraos. The Furies of Laios and Oedipus did not vent their wrath on
Tisamenus, but they did on his son Autesion, so that, at the bidding of
the oracle, he migrated to the Dorians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.5.16">

On the departure of Autesion, Damasichthon was chosen to be king, who
was a son of Opheltes, the son of Peneleos. This Damasichthon had a son
Ptolemy, who was the father of Xanthos. Xanthos fought a duel with
Andropompus, who killed him by craft and not in fair fight. Hereafter
the Thebans thought it better to entrust the government to several
people, rather than to let everything depend on one man.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.6.1">

Of the successes and failures of the Thebans in battle I found the most
famous to be the following. They were overcome in battle by the
Athenians, who had come to the aid of the Plataeans, when a war had
arisen about the boundaries of their territory. They met with a second
disaster when arrayed against the Athenians at Plataea,[^562] at the
time when they are considered to have chosen the cause of King Xerxes
rather than that of Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.6.2">

The Theban people are in no way responsible for this choice, as at that
time an oligarchy was in power at Thebes and not their ancestral form of
government. In the same way, if it had been while Peisistratos or his
sons still held Athens under a despotism that the barbarian had invaded
Greece, the Athenians too would certainly have been accused of favoring
Persia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.6.3">

Afterwards, however, the Thebans won a victory over the Athenians at
Delium in the territory of Tanagra,[^563] where the Athenian general
Hippokrates, son of Ariphron, perished with the greater part of the
army. During the period that began with the departure of the Persians
and ended with the war between Athens and the Peloponnesus, the
relations between Thebes and the Lacedaemonians were friendly. But when
the war was fought out and the Athenian navy destroyed, after a brief
interval Thebes along with Corinth was involved in the war with
Lacedaemon.[^564]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.6.4">

Overcome in battle at Corinth and Coroncia, they won on the other hand
at Leuktra the most famous victory we know of gained by Greeks over
Greeks. They put down the boards of ten, which the Lacedaemonians had
set up in the cities, and drove out the Spartan governors. Afterwards
they also waged for ten years consecutively the war at Phokis, called by
the Greeks the Sacred War.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.6.5">

I have already said in my history of Attica[^565] that the defeat at
Khairōneia was a disaster for all the Greeks; but it was even more so
for the Thebans, as a garrison was brought into their city. When Philip
died, and the kingship of Macedonia devolved on Alexander, the Thebans
succeeded in destroying the garrison. But as soon as they had done so,
the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\] warned
them of the destruction that was coming on them, and the signs that
occurred in the sanctuary of Demeter Lawgiver were the opposite of those
that occurred before the action at Leuktra.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.6.6">

For then spiders spun a white web over the door of the sanctuary, but on
the approach of Alexander with his Macedonians the web was black. It is
also said that there was a shower of ashes in Athens the year before the
war waged against them by Sulla, which brought on them such great
sufferings.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.7.1">

On this occasion the Thebans were removed from their homes by Alexander,
and straggled to Athens; afterwards they were restored by Kassandros,
son of Antipatros. Heartiest in their support of the restoration of
Thebes were the Athenians, and they were helped by Messenians and the
Arcadians of Megalopolis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.7.2">

My own view is that in building Thebes Kassandros was mainly influenced
by hatred of Alexander. He destroyed the whole house of Alexander to the
bitter end. Olympias he threw to the exasperated Macedonians to be
stoned to death; and the sons of Alexander, Hēraklēs by Barsina and
Alexander by Rōxanē, he killed by poison. But he himself was not to come
to a good end. He was filled with dropsy, and from the dropsy came worms
while he was yet alive.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.7.3">

Philip, the eldest of his sons, shortly after coming to the throne was
seized by a wasting disease which proved fatal. Antipatros, the next
son, murdered his mother Thessalonikē, the daughter of Philip, son of
Amyntas, and of Nicasipolis, charging her with being too fond of
Alexander, who was the youngest of the sons of Kassandros. Getting the
support of Demetrios, the son of Antigonos, he deposed with his help and
punished his brother Antipatros. However, it appeared that in Demetrios
he found a murderer and not an ally.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.7.4">

So some god was to exact from Kassandros a just requital. In the time of
Kassandros all the ancient circuit of the Theban walls was rebuilt, but
fate after all willed that afterwards the Thebans were again to taste
the cup of great misfortune. For when Mithridates had begun the war with
the Romans, he was joined by the Thebans, for no other reason, in my
opinion, except their friendship for the Athenian people. But when Sulla
invaded Boeotia, terror seized the Thebans; they at once changed sides,
and sought the friendship of the Romans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.7.5">

Sulla nevertheless was angry with them, and among his plans to humble
them was to cut away one half of their territory. His pretext was as
follows. When he began the war against Mithridates, he was short of
funds. So he collected offerings from Olympia, those at Epidaurus, and
all those at Delphi that had been left by the men of Phokis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.7.6">

These he divided among his soldiery, and repaid the gods with half of
the Theban territory. Although by favor of the Romans the Thebans
afterwards recovered the land of which they had been deprived, yet from
this point they sank into the greatest depths of weakness. The lower
city of Thebes is all deserted today, except the sanctuaries, and the
people live on the citadel, which they call Thebes and not Cadmeia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.8.1">

Across the Asopos, about ten stadium-lengths distant from the city, are
the ruins of Potniae, in which is a grove of Demeter and the Maiden. The
images at the river that flows past Potniae… they name the goddesses. At
an appointed time they perform their accustomed ritual, one part of
which is to let loose young pigs into what are called “the halls.” At
the same time next year these pigs appear, they say, in Dodona. This
story others can believe if they wish.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.8.2">

Here there is also a temple of Dionysus Goat-shooter. For once, when
they were sacrificing to the god, they grew so violent with wine that
they actually killed the priest of Dionysus. Immediately after the
murder they were visited by a pestilence, and the Delphic oracle said
that to cure it they must sacrifice a boy in the bloom of youth. A few
years afterwards, so they say, the god substituted a goat as a victim in
place of their boy. In Potniaiis also shown a well. The mares of the
country are said on drinking this water to become mad.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.8.3">

On the way from Potniaito Thebes there is on the right of the road a
small enclosure with pillars in it. Here they think the earth opened to
receive Amphiaraos, and they add further that neither do birds sit upon
these pillars, nor will a beast, tame or wild, graze on the grass that
grows here.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.8.4">

In the circuit of the ancient wall of Thebes were gates seven in number,
and these remain today. One got its name, I learned, from Electra, the
sister of Kadmos, and another, the Proetidian, from a native of Thebes.
He was Proitos, but I found it difficult to discover his date and
lineage. The Neistan gate, they say, got its name for the following
reason. The last of the lyre’s strings they call nete, and Amphion
invented it, they say, at this gate. I have also heard that the son of
Zethus, the brother of Amphion, was named Neis, and that after him was
this gate called.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.8.5">

The Crenaean gate and the Hypsistan they so name for the following
reason … and by the Hypsistan is a sanctuary of Zeus surnamed Hypsistos
(Most High). Next after these gates is the one called Ogygian, and
lastly the Homoloid gate. It appeared to me too that the name of the
last was the most recent, and that of the Ogygian the most ancient.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.8.6">

The name Homoloid is derived, they say, from the following circumstance.
When the Thebans were beaten in battle by the Argives near Glisas, most
of them withdrew along with Laodamas, the son of Eteokles. A portion of
them shrank from the journey to Illyria, and turning aside to Thessaly
they seized Homole, the most fertile and best-watered of the Thessalian
mountains.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.8.7">

When they were recalled to their homes by Thersandros, the son of
Polyneikes, they called the gate, through which they passed on their
return, the Homoloid gate after Homole. The entry into Thebes from
Plataea is by the Electran gate. At this, so they say, Capaneus, the son
of Hipponous, was struck by lightning as he was making a more furious
attack upon the fortifications.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.9.1">

This war between Argos and Thebes was, in my opinion, the most memorable
of all those waged by Greeks against Greeks in what is called the heroic
age. In the case of the war between the Eleusinians and the rest of the
Athenians, and likewise in that between the Thebans and the Minyans, the
attackers had but a short distance through which to pass to the fight,
and one battle decided the war, immediately after which hostilities
ceased and peace was made.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.9.2">

But the Argive army marched from mid-Peloponnesus to mid-Boeotia, while
Adrastos collected his allied forces out of Arcadia and from the
Messenians, and likewise mercenaries came to the help of the Thebans
from Phokis, and the Phlegyans from the Minyan country. When the battle
took place at the Ismenian sanctuary, the Thebans were worsted in the
encounter, and after the rout took refuge within their fortifications.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.9.3">

As the Peloponnesians did not know how to assail the walls, and attacked
with greater spirit than knowledge, many of them were killed by missiles
hurled from the walls by the Thebans, who afterwards sallied forth and
overcame the rest while they were in disorder, so that the whole army
was destroyed with the exception of Adrastos. But the action was
attended by severe losses to the Thebans, and from that time they term a
Cadmean victory one that brings destruction to the victors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.9.4">

A few years afterwards Thebes was attacked by Thersandros and those whom
the Greeks call Epigonoi (Born later). It is clear that they too were
accompanied not only by the Argives, Messenians and Arcadians, but also
by allies from Corinth and Megara invited to help them. Thebes too was
defended by their neighbors, and a battle at Glisas was fiercely
contested on both sides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.9.5">

Some of the Thebans escaped with Laodamas immediately after their
defeat; those who remained behind were besieged and taken. About this
war an epic poem also was written called the Thebaid. This poem is
mentioned by Callinus, who says that the author was Homer, and many good
authorities agree with his judgment. With the exception of the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> I rate the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Thebaid</span> more highly than any
other poem. So much for the war waged by the Argives against the Thebans
on account of the sons of Oedipus.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.10.1">

Not far from the gate is a common tomb, where lie all those who met
their death when fighting against Alexander and the Macedonians. Hard by
they show a place where, it is said, Kadmos (he may believe the story
who likes) sowed the teeth of the dragon, which he slew at the fountain,
from which teeth men came up out of the earth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.10.2">

On the right of the gate is a hill sacred to Apollo. Both the hill and
the god are called Ismenian, as the river Ismenus Rows by the place.
First at the entrance are Athena and Hermes, stone figures and named
Pronai (Of the fore-temple). The Hermes is said to have been made by
Pheidias, the Athena by Scopas. The temple is built behind. The image is
in size equal to that at Brankhidai; and does not differ from it at all
in shape. Whoever has seen one of these two images, and learned who was
the artist, does not need much skill to discern, when he looks at the
other, that it is a work of Kanakhos. The only difference is that the
image at Brankhidai is of bronze, while the Ismenian is of cedar-wood.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.10.3">

Here there is a stone, on which, they say, used to sit Manto, the
daughter of Teiresias. This stone lies before the entrance, and they
still call it the chair of Manto. On the right of the temple are statues
of women made of stone, said to be portraits of Henioche and Pyrrha,
daughters of Creon, who reigned as guardian of Laodamas, the son of
Eteokles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.10.4">

The following custom is, to my knowledge, still carried out in Thebes. A
boy of noble family, who is himself both handsome and strong, is chosen
priest of Ismenian Apollo for a year. He is called Laurel-bearer, for
the boys wear wreaths of laurel leaves. I cannot say for certain whether
all alike who have worn the laurel dedicate by custom a bronze tripod to
the god; but I do not think that it is the rule for all, because I did
not see many votive tripods there. But the wealthier of the boys do
certainly dedicate them. Most remarkable both for its age and for the
fame of him who dedicated it is a tripod dedicated by Amphitryon for
Hēraklēs after he had worn the laurel.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.10.5">

Higher up than the Ismenian sanctuary you may see the fountain which
they say is sacred to Ares, and they add that a dragon was posted by
Ares as a sentry over the spring. By this fountain is the tomb of
Caanthus. They say that he was brother to Melia and son to Okeanos, and
that he was commissioned by his father to seek his sister, who had been
carried away. Finding that Apollo had Melia, and being unable to get her
from him, he dared to set fire to the precinct of Apollo that is now
called the Ismenian sanctuary. The god, according to the Thebans, shot
him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.10.6">

Here then is the tomb of Caanthus. They say that Apollo had sons by
Melia, to wit, Tenerus and Ismenus. To Tenerus Apollo gave the art of
divination, and from Ismenus the river got its name. Not that the river
was nameless before, if indeed it was called Ladon before Ismenus was
born to Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.11.1">

On the left of the gate named Electran are the ruins of a house where
they say Amphitryon came to live when exiled from Tiryns because of the
death of Electryon; and the chamber of Alkmene is still plainly to be
seen among the ruins. They say that it was built for Amphitryon by
Trophonios and Agamedes, and that on it was written the following
inscription:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“When Amphitryon was about to bring hither his bride

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Alkmene, he chose this as a chamber for himself.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Anchasian Trophonios and Agamedes made it.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.11.2">

Such was the inscription that the Thebans say was written here. They
show also the tomb of the children of Hēraklēs by Megara. Their account
of the death of these is in no way different from that in the poems of
Panyassis and of Stesichorus of Himera. But the Thebans add that
Hēraklēs in his madness was about to kill Amphitryon as well, but before
he could do so he was rendered unconscious by the blow of the stone.
Athena, they say, threw at him this stone, which they name Chastiser.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.11.3">

Here are portraits of women in relief, but the figures are by this time
rather indistinct. The Thebans call them Witches,[^566] adding that they
were sent by Hērā to hinder the birth-pangs of Alkmene. So these kept
Alkmene from bringing forth her child. But Historis, the daughter of
Teiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the Witches, and she uttered a
loud cry of joy in their hearing, that Alkmene had been delivered. So
the story goes that the Witches were deceived and went away, and Alkmene
brought forth her child.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.11.4">

Here is a sanctuary of Hēraklēs. The image, of white marble, is called
Champion, and the Thebans Xenokritos and Eubios were the artists. But
the ancient wooden image is thought by the Thebans to be by Daidalos,
and the same opinion occurred to me. It was dedicated, they say, by
Daidalos himself, as a thank-offering for a benefit. For when he was
fleeing from Crete in small vessels which he had made for himself and
his son Icarus, he devised for the ships sails, an invention as yet
unknown to the men of those times, so as to take advantage of a
favorable wind and outsail the oared fleet of Minos. Daidalos himself
was saved,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.11.5">

but the ship of Icarus is said to have overturned, as he was a clumsy
helmsman. The drowned man was carried ashore by the current to the
island, then without a name, that lies off Samos. Hēraklēs came across
the body and recognized it, giving it burial where even today a small
mound still stands to Icarus on a promontory jutting out into the
Aegean. After this Icarus are named both the island and the sea around
it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.11.6">

The carvings on the gables at Thebes are by Praxiteles, and include most
of what are called the twelve labors. The slaughter of the Stymphalian
birds and the purifying of the land of Elis by Hēraklēs are omitted; in
their place is represented the wrestling with Antaios. Thrasyboulos, son
of Lykos, and the Athenians who with him put down the tyranny of the
Thirty,[^567] set out from Thebes when they returned to Athens, and
therefore they dedicated in the sanctuary of Hēraklēs colossal figures
of Athena and Hēraklēs, carved by Alkamenes in relief out of Pentelic
marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.11.7">

Adjoining the sanctuary of Hēraklēs are a gymnasium and a race-course,
both being named after the god. Beyond the Chastiser stone is an altar
of Apollo surnamed God of Ashes; it is made out of the ashes of the
victims. The customary mode of divination here is from voices, which is
used by the Smyrnaeans, to my knowledge, more than by any other Greeks.
For at Smyrna also there is a sanctuary of Voices outside the wall and
beyond the city.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.12.1">

The Thebans in ancient days used to sacrifice bulls to Apollo of the
Ashes. Once when the festival was being held, the hour of the sacrifice
was near but those sent to fetch the bull had not arrived. And so, as a
wagon happened to be near by, they sacrificed to the god one of the
oxen, and ever since it has been the custom to sacrifice working oxen.
The following story also is current among the Thebans. As Kadmos was
leaving Delphi by the road to Phokis, a cow, it is said, guided him on
his way. This cow was one bought from the herdsmen of Pelagon, and on
each of her sides was a white mark like the orb of a full moon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.12.2">

Now the oracle of the god had said that Kadmos and the host with him
were to make their dwelling where the cow was going to sink down in
weariness. So this is one of the places that they point out. Here there
is in the open an altar and an image of Athena, said to have been
dedicated by Kadmos. Those who think that the Kadmos who came to the
Theban land was an Egyptian, and not a Phoenician, have their opinion
contradicted by the name of this Athena, because she is called by the
Phoenician name of Onga, and not by the Egyptian name of Sais.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.12.3">

The Thebans assert that on the part of their citadel, where today stands
their marketplace, was in ancient times the house of Kadmos. They point
out the ruins of the bridal-chamber of Harmonia, and of one which they
say was Semele’s into the latter they allow no man to step even now.
Those Greeks who allow that the Muses sang at the wedding of Harmonia,
can point to the spot in the marketplace where it is said that the
goddesses sang.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.12.4">

There is also a story that along with the thunderbolt hurled at the
bridalchamber of Semele there fell a log from the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\]. They say
that Polydoros adorned this log with bronze and called it Dionysus
Kadmos. Near is an image of Dionysus; Onasimedes made it of solid
bronze. The altar was built by the sons of Praxiteles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.12.5">

There is a statue of Pronomos, a very great favorite with the people for
his playing on the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>
\[‘double-reed’\]. For a time
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>-players had three
forms of the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>. On
one they played Dorian music; for Phrygian melodies
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">auloi</span> of a different
pattern were made; what is called the Lydian mode was played on
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">auloi</span> of a third kind. It
was Pronomos who first devised an
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\]
equally suited for every kind of melody, and was the first to play on
the same instrument music so vastly different in form.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.12.6">

It is also said that he gave his audience untold delight by the
expression of his face and by the movement of his whole body. He also
composed for the Chalcidians on the Euripus a processional tune for
their use in Delos. So the Thebans set up here a statue of this man, and
likewise one of Epameinondas, son of Polymnis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.1">

Epameinondas had famous ancestors, but his father had less wealth than a
Theban of ordinary means. He was most thoroughly taught all the subjects
of the national education, and when a young man went to receive
instruction from Lysis, whose lineage originated from Tarentum, learned
in the philosophy of Pythagoras the Samian. When Lacedaemon was at war
with Mantineia, Epameinondas is said to have been sent with certain
others from Thebes to help the Lacedaemonians. In the battle Pelopidas
received wounds, but his life was saved by Epameinondas at the greatest
risk to his own.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.2">

Later on, when Epameinondas had come to Sparta as an envoy, what time
the Lacedaemonians said they were concluding with the Greeks the peace
called the Peace of Antalkidas,[^568] Agesilaos asked him whether they
would allow each Boeotian city to swear to the peace separately. He
replied: “No, Spartans, not before we see your vassals[^569] taking the
oath city by city.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.3">

When the war between Lacedaemon and Thebes had already broken out, and
the Lacedaemonians were advancing to attack the Thebans with a force of
their own men and of their allies, Epameinondas with a part of the army
occupied to meet them a position above the Cephisian lake, under the
impression that at this point the Peloponnesians would make their
invasion. But Kleombrotos, the king of the Lacedaemonians, turned
towards Ambrossos in Phokis. He massacred a Theban force under Khaireas,
who was under orders to guard the passes, crossed the high ground and
reached Leuktra in Boeotia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.4">

Here the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\]
sent signs to the Lacedaemonian people and to Kleombrotos
personally.[^570] The Lacedaemonian kings were accompanied on their
expeditions by sheep, to serve as sacrifices to the gods and to give
fair omens before battles. The flocks were led on the march by
she-goats, called katoiades by the herdsmen. On this occasion, then, the
wolves dashed on the flock, did no harm at all to the sheep, but killed
the goats called
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">katoiades</span>.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.5">

It was also said that the wrath of the daughters of Scedasus fell upon
the Lacedaemonians. Scedasus, who lived near Leuktra, had two daughters,
Molpia and Hippo. These in the bloom of their youth were wickedly
outraged by two Lacedaemonians, Phrurarchidas and Parthenios. The girls,
unable to bear the shame of their violation, immediately hanged
themselves. Scedasus repaired to Lacedaemon, but meeting with no justice
returned to Leuktra and committed suicide.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.6">

Well, on this occasion Epameinondas sacrificed with prayers to Scedasus
and his girls, implying that the battle would be to avenge them no less
than to secure the salvation of Thebes. The Boeotarchs were not agreed,
but differed widely in their opinions. For Epameinondas, Malgis and
Xenokrates were minded to do battle with the Lacedaemonians at once, but
Damokleidas, Damophilus and Simangelus were against joining in battle,
and urged that they should put wives and children safely out of the way
in Attica, and prepare to undergo a siege themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.7">

So divergent were the views of the six. The seventh Boeotarch, whose
name was Brachyllides, was guarding the pass by Cithaeron, and on his
return to the army added his vote to the side of Epameinondas, and then
there was a unanimous decision to try the ordeal of battle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.8">

But Epameinondas had his suspicions of some of the Boeotians especially
of the Thespians. Fearing, therefore, lest they should desert during the
engagement, he permitted all who would to leave the camp and go home.
The Thespians left with all their forces, as did any other Boeotians who
felt annoyed with the Thebans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.9">

When the battle joined, the allies of the Lacedaemonians, who had
hitherto been not the best of friends, now showed most clearly their
hostility, by their reluctance to stand their ground, and by giving way
wherever the enemy attacked them. The Lacedaemonians themselves and the
Thebans were not badly matched adversaries. The former had their
previous experience, and their shame of lessening the reputation of
Sparta; the Thebans realized that what was at stake was their country,
their wives and their children.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.10">

But when king Kleombrotos with several Lacedaemonian magistrates had
fallen, the Spartans were bound by necessity not to give way, in spite
of their distress. For among the Lacedaemonians it was considered the
greatest disgrace to allow the body of a king to come into the hands of
enemies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.11">

The victory of Thebes was the most famous ever won by Greeks over
Greeks. The Lacedaemonians on the following day were minded to bury
their dead, and sent a herald to the Thebans. But Epameinondas, knowing
that the Lacedaemonians were always inclined to cover up their
disasters, said that he permitted their allies first to take up their
dead, and only when these had done so did he approve of the
Lacedaemonians’ burying their own dead.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.13.12">

Some of the allies took up no dead at all, as not a man of them had
fallen; others had but slight loss to report. So when the Lacedaemonians
proceeded to bury their own, it was at once proved that the fallen were
Spartans. The loss of the Thebans and of such Boeotians as remained
loyal amounted to forty-seven, but of the Lacedaemonians themselves
there fell more than a thousand men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.14.1">

After the battle Epameinondas for a while, having proclaimed that the
other Peloponnesians should depart home, kept the Lacedaemonians cooped
up in Leuktra. But when reports came that the Spartans in the city were
marching to a man to the help of their countrymen at Leuktra,
Epameinondas allowed his enemy to depart under a truce, saying that it
would be better for the Boeotians to shift the war from Boeotia to
Lacedaemon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.14.2">

The Thespians, apprehensive because of the ancient hostility of Thebes
and its present good fortune, resolved to abandon their city and to seek
a refuge in Ceressus. It is a stronghold in the land of the Thespians,
in which once in days of old they had established themselves to meet the
invasion of the Thessalians. On that occasion the Thessalians tried to
take Ceressus, but success seemed hopeless. So they consulted the god at
Delphi,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.14.3">

and received the following response:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“A care to me is shady Leuktra, and so is the Alesian soil;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

A care to me are the two sorrowful girls of Scedasus.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

There a tearful battle is nigh, and no one will foretell it,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Until the Dorians have lost their glorious youth,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When the day of fate has come.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Then may Ceressus be captured, but at no other time.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.14.4">

On the latter occasion Epameinondas captured the Thespians who had taken
refuge in Ceressus, and immediately afterwards devoted his attention to
the situation in the Peloponnesus, to which also the Arcadians were
eagerly inviting him. On his arrival he won the willing support of
Argos, while he collected again into their ancient city the Mantineians,
who had been scattered into village communities by Agesipolis. He
persuaded the Arcadians to destroy all their weak towns, and built them
a home where they could live together, which even at the present day is
called Megalopolis (Great City).

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.14.5">

The period of his office as Boeotarch had now expired, and death was the
penalty fixed if a man exceeded it. So Epameinondas, disregarding the
law as out of date, remained in office, marched to Sparta with his army,
and when Agesilaos did not come out to meet him, turned to the founding
of Messene. Epameinondas, was the founder of the modern Messene, and the
history of its foundation I have included in my account of the
Messenians themselves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.14.6">

Meanwhile the allies of Thebes scattered and overran the Laconian
territory, pillaging what it contained. This persuaded Epameinondas to
lead the Thebans back to Boeotia. In his advance with the army he came
over against Lechaeum, and was about to cross the narrow and difficult
parts of the road, when Iphikrates, the son of Timotheus, attacked the
Thebans with a force of targeteers and other Athenians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.14.7">

Epameinondas put his assailants to flight and came right up to the very
city of Athens, but as Iphikrates dissuaded the Athenians from coming
out to fight, he proceeded to march back to Thebes. Epameinondas stood
his trial on a capital charge for holding the office of Boeotarch when
his tenure had already expired. It is said that the jury appointed to
try him did not even record their votes on the charge.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.15.1">

After these things when Alexander held sway in Thessaly, Pelopidas came
to him, under the impression that he was well-disposed to him personally
as well as a friend to the Theban commonwealth, but on his arrival was
treacherously and insolently thrown into prison and kept there by
Alexander. The Thebans at once set out to attack Alexander, and made
leaders of the expedition Kleomenes and Hypatos, who were Boeotarchs at
that time; Epameinondas was serving in the ranks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.15.2">

When the force had reached the other side of Thermopylae, Alexander
surprised and attacked it on difficult ground. As there appeared to be
no means of safety, the rest of the army chose Epameinondas to be
leader, and the Boeotarchs of their own accord resigned the command.
Alexander lost confidence in winning the war when he saw Epameinondas at
the head of his opponents, and of his own accord set free Pelopidas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.15.3">

In the absence of Epameinondas the Thebans removed the Orkhomenians from
their land. Epameinondas regarded their removal as a disaster, and
declared that had he been present never would the Thebans have been
guilty of such an outrage.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.15.4">

Elected again to be Boeotarch, and again invading the Peloponnesus with
an army of Boeotians, he overcame the Lacedaemonians in a battle at
Lechaeum, and with them Achaeans of Pellene and Athenians led from
Athens by Chabrias. The Thebans had a rule that they should set free for
a ransom all their prisoners except such as were Boeotian fugitives;
these they punished with death. So when he captured the Sikyonian town
of Phoebia, in which were gathered most of the Boeotian fugitives, he
assigned to each of those whom he captured in it a new nationality, any
that occurred to him, and set them free.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.15.5">

On reaching Mantineia with his army, he was killed in the hour of
victory by an Athenian.[^571] In the painting in Athens of the battle of
the cavalry the man who is killing Epameinondas is Grylos, the son of
the Xenophon who took part in the expedition of Cyrus against king
Artaxerxes and led the Greeks back to the sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.15.6">

On the statue of Epameinondas is an inscription in elegiac verse
relating among other things that he founded Messene, and that through
him the Greeks won freedom. The elegiac verses are these:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“By my counsels was Sparta shorn of her glory,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And holy Messene received at last her children.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

By the arms of Thebe was Megalopolis encircled with walls,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And all Greece won independence and freedom.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.16.1">

Such were the claims to fame of Epameinondas. Not far away is a temple
of Ammon; the image, a work of Kalamis, was dedicated by Pindar, who
also sent to the Ammonians of Libya a hymn to Ammon. This hymn I found
still carved on a triangular slab by the side of the altar dedicated to
Ammon by Ptolemy the son of Lagos. After the sanctuary of Ammon at
Thebes comes what is called the bird-observatory of Teiresias, and near
it is a sanctuary of Fortune, who carries the child Wealth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.16.2">

According to the Thebans, the hands and face of the image were made by
Xenophon the Athenian, the rest of it by Kallistonikos, a native. It was
a clever idea of these artists to place Wealth in the arms of Fortune,
and so to suggest that she is his mother or nurse. Equally clever was
the conception of Kephisodotos, who made the image of Peace for the
Athenians with Wealth in her arms.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.16.3">

At Thebes are three wooden images of Aphrodite, so very ancient that
they are actually said to be votive offerings of Harmonia, and the story
is that they were made out of the wooden figureheads on the ships of
Kadmos. They call the first the celestial one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Ourania</span>\], the second
the one who is common to the district
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Pan-dēmos</span>\], and the
third the Averter
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Apo-strophia</span>\].
Harmonia gave to Aphrodite the surname of the celestial one

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.16.4">

to signify a love pure and free from bodily lust; that of the one who

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Pan-dēmos</span>\], to denote
sexual intercourse; the third, that of Averter
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Apo-strophia</span>\], who
would turn humankind away from unlawful passion and sinful acts. For
Harmonia knew of many crimes already perpetrated not only among
barbarians but even by Greeks, similar to what later became subjects of
songs sung \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">āidesthai</span>\]
about the mother of Adonis, about Phaedra the daughter of Minos, and
about the Thracian Tereus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.16.5">

The sanctuary of Demeter Lawgiver is said to have been at one time the
house of Kadmos and his descendants. The image of Demeter is visible
down to the chest. Here have been dedicated bronze shields, said to be
those of Lacedaemonian officers who fell at Leuktra.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.16.6">

Near the Proetidian gate is built a theater, and quite close to the
theater is a temple of Dionysus surnamed Deliverer. For when some Theban
prisoners in the hands of Thracians had reached Haliartia on their
march, they were delivered by the god, who gave up the sleeping
Thracians to be put to death. One of the two images here the Thebans say
is Semele. Once in each year, they say, they open the sanctuary on
stated days.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.16.7">

There are also ruins of the house of Lykos, and the tomb of Semele, but
Alkmene has no tomb. It is said that on her death she was turned from
human form to a stone, but the Theban account does not agree with the
Megarian. What things the Greeks say about them are generally different
from each other. Here too at Thebes are the tombs of the children of
Amphion. The boys lie apart; the girls are buried separately.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.17.1">

Near is the temple of Artemis Eukleia. The image was made by Scopas.
They say that within the sanctuary were buried Androkleia and Alkis,
daughters of Antipoinos. For when Hēraklēs and the Thebans were about to
engage in battle with the men of Orkhomenos, an oracle was delivered to
them that success in the war would be theirs if their citizen of the
most noble descent would consent to die by his own hand. Now Antipoinos,
who had the most famous ancestors, was loath to die for the people, but
his daughters were quite ready to do so. So they took their own lives
and receive honors
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tīmai</span>\] for that
reason.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.17.2">

Before the temple of Artemis Eukleia is a lion made of stone, said to
have been dedicated by Hēraklēs after he had conquered in the battle the
Orkhomenians and their king, Erginos son of Klymenos. Near it is Apollo
surnamed Rescuer, and Hermes called of the Marketplace, another of the
votive offerings of Pindar. The pyre of the children of Amphion is about
half a stadium-length from the tombs. The ashes from the pyre are still
there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.17.3">

Near this are two stone images of Athena, surnamed Girder, said to have
been dedicated by Amphitryon.[^572] For here, they say, he put on his
armor when he was about to give battle to Chalcodon and the Euboeans. It
seems that the ancients used the verb “to gird oneself” in the sense of
“to put on one’s armor,” and so they say that when Homer compares
Agamemnon to Ares “in respect of his waistband,” he is really saying
that they were alike in the fashion of their armor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.17.4">

The tomb shared by Zethus and Amphion is a small mound of earth. The
inhabitants of Tithorea in Phokis like to steal earth from it when the
sun is passing through the constellation Taurus. For if at that time
they take earth from the mound and set it on Antiope’s tomb, the land of
Tithorea will yield a harvest, but that of Thebes will be less fertile.
For this reason the Thebans at that time keep watch over the tomb.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.17.5">

Both these cities hold this belief, and they do so because of the
oracles of Bacis, in which are the lines:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“But when a man of Tithorea to Amphion and to Zethus

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Pours on the earth peace-offerings of libation and prayer,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When Taurus is warmed by the might of the glorious sun,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Beware then of no slight disaster threatening the city;

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

For the harvest wastes away in it,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When they take of the earth, and bring it to the tomb of Phokos.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.17.6">

Bacis calls it the tomb of Phokos for the following reason. The wife of
Lykos worshipped Dionysus more than any other deity. When she had
suffered what the story says she suffered, Dionysus was angry with
Antiope. For some reason extravagant punishments always arouse the
resentment of the gods. They say that Antiope went mad, and when out of
her wits roamed all over Greece; but Phokos, son of Ornytion, son of
Sisyphus, chanced to meet her, cured her madness, and then married her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.17.7">

So Antiope and Phokos share the same tomb. The roughly quarried stones,
laid along the tomb of Amphion at its base, are said to be the very
rocks that followed the singing of Amphion. A similar story is told of
Orpheus, how wild creatures followed him as he played the harp.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.18.1">

The road from Thebes to Chalcis is by this Proetidian gate. On the
highway is pointed out the tomb of Melanippos, one of the very best of
the soldiers of Thebes. When the Argive invasion occurred this
Melanippos killed Tydeus, as well as Mecisteus, one of the brothers of
Adrastos, while he himself, they say, met his death at the hands of
Amphiaraos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.18.2">

Quite close to it are three unfinished stones. The Theban antiquaries
assert that the man lying here is Tydeus, and that his burial was
carried out by Maeon. As proof of their assertion they quoted a line of
the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Of Tydeus, who at Thebes is covered by a heap of earth.”

Adjoining are the tombs of the children of Oedipus. The ritual observed
at them I have never seen, but I regard it as credible. For the Thebans
say that among those called heroes to whom they offer sacrifice are the
children of Oedipus. As the sacrifice is being offered, the flame, so
they say, and the smoke from it divide themselves into two. I was led to
believe their story by the fact that I have seen a similar wonder. It
was this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.18.4">

In Mysia beyond the Kaïkos is a town called Pioniae, the founder of
which according to the inhabitants was Pionis, one of the descendants of
Hēraklēs. When they are going to sacrifice to him as to a hero, smoke of
itself rises up out of the tomb. This occurrence, then, I have seen
happening. The Thebans show also the tomb of Teiresias, about fifteen
stadium-lengths from the tomb of the children of Oedipus. The Thebans
themselves agree that Teiresias met his end in Haliartia, and admit that
the monument at Thebes is a cenotaph.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.18.5">

There is also at Thebes the tomb of Hector, the son of Priam. It is near
the spring called the Fountain of Oedipus, and the Thebans say that they
brought Hector’s bones from Troy because of the following oracle:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Ye Thebans who dwell in the city of Kadmos,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

If you wish blameless wealth for the country in which you live,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Bring to your homes the bones of Hector, Priam’s son,

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

From Asia, and reverence him as a hero, according to the bidding of
Zeus.”

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.18.6">

The Fountain of Oedipus was so named because Oedipus washed off into it
the blood of his murdered father. Hard by the spring is the tomb of
Asphodikos. He it was who in the fighting with the Argives killed
Parthenopaios, the son of Talaos. This is the Theban account, but
according to the passage in the Thebaid which tells of the death of
Parthenopaios it was Periclymenus who killed him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.1">

On this highway is a place called Teumessus, where it is said that
Europa was hidden by Zeus. There is also another tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\], which tells of
a fox called the Teumessian fox, how owing to the wrath of Dionysus the
beast was reared to destroy the Thebans, and how, when about to be
caught by the hound given by Artemis to Procris the daughter of
Erekhtheus, the fox was turned into a stone, as was likewise this hound.
In Teumessus there is also a sanctuary of Telchinian Athena, which
contains no image. As to her surname, we may hazard the conjecture that
a division of the Telchinians who once dwelled in Cyprus came to Boeotia
and established a sanctuary of Telchinian Athena.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.2">

Seven stadium-lengths from Teumessus on the left are the ruins of
Glisas, and before them on the right of the way a small mound shaded by
cultivated trees and a wood of wild ones. Here were buried Promakhos,
the son of Parthenopaios, and other Argive officers, who joined with
Aigialeus, the son of Adrastos, in the expedition against Thebes. That
the tomb of Aigialeus is at Pegai I have already stated in an earlier
part of my inquiry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">historia</span>\][^573] that
deals with Megara.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.3">

On the straight road from Thebes to Glisas is a place surrounded by
unhewn stones, called by the Thebans the Snake’s Head. This snake,
whatever it was, popped its head, they say, out of its hole here, and
Teiresias, chancing to meet it, cut off the head with his sword. This
then is how the place got its name. Above Glisas is a mountain called
Supreme, and on it a temple and image of Supreme Zeus. The river, a
torrent, they call the Thermodon. Returning to Teumessus and the road to
Chalcis, you come to the tomb of Chalcodon, who was killed by Amphitryon
in a fight between the Thebans and the Euboeans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.4">

Adjoining are the ruins of the cities Harma (Chariot) and Mykalessos.
The former got its name, according to the people of Tanagra, because the
chariot of Amphiaraos disappeared here, and not where the Thebans say it
did. Both peoples agree that Mykalessos was so named because the cow
lowed (<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">emykesato</span>) here
that was guiding Kadmos and his host to Thebes. How Mykalessos was laid
waste I have related in that part of my history that deals with the
Athenians.[^574]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.5">

On the way to the coast of Mykalessos is a sanctuary of Mycalessian
Demeter. They say that each night it is shut up and opened again by
Hēraklēs, and that Hēraklēs is one of what are called the Idaean
Dactyls. Here is shown the following marvel. Before the feet of the
image they place all the fruits of autumn, and these remain fresh
throughout all the year.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.6">

At this place the Euripus separates Euboea from Boeotia. On the right is
the sanctuary of Mycalessian Demeter, and a little farther on is Aulis,
said to have been named after the daughter of Ogygus. Here there is a
temple of Artemis with two images of white marble; one carries torches,
and the other is like to one shooting an arrow. The story is that when,
in obedience to the soothsaying of Calchas, the Greeks were about to
sacrifice Iphigeneia on the altar, the goddess substituted a deer to be
the victim instead of her. They preserve in the temple what still
survives of the

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.7">

plane tree mentioned by Homer in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>.[^575] The story is that
the Greeks were kept at Aulis by contrary winds, and when suddenly a
favoring breeze sprang up, each sacrificed to Artemis the victim he had
to hand, female and male alike. From that time the rule has held good at
Aulis that oil victims are permissible. There is also shown the spring,
by which the plane tree grew, and on a hill near by the bronze threshold
of Agamemnon’s tent.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.19.8">

In front of the sanctuary grow palm trees, the fruit of which, though
not wholly edible like the dates of Palestine, yet are riper than those
of Ionia. There are but few inhabitants of Aulis, and these are potters.
This land, and that about Mykalessos and Harma, is tilled by the people
of Tanagra.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.20.1">

Within the territory of Tanagra is what is called Delium on Sea. In it
are images of Artemis and Leto. The people of Tanagra say that their
founder was Poimandros, the son of Khairesilaos, the son of Iasios, the
son of Eleuther, who, they say, was the son of Apollo by Aethusa, the
daughter of Poseidon. It is said that Poimandros married Tanagra, a
daughter of Aeolus. But in a poem of Corinna she is said to be a
daughter of Asopos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.20.2">

There is a story that, as she reached extreme old age, her neighbors
ceased to call her by this name, and gave the name of Graea (old woman),
first to the woman herself, and in course of time to the city. The name,
they say, persisted so long that even Homer says in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Catalogue</span>:

There is in Tanagra the tomb of Orion, and Mount Kerykion, the reputed
birthplace of Hermes, and also a place called Polos. Here they say that
Atlas sat and meditated deeply upon the things of the underworld and the
things of the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ourania</span>\] , as
Homer[^576] says of him:

In the temple of Dionysus the image too is worth seeing, being of Parian
marble and a work of Kalamis. But a greater marvel still is the Triton.
The grander of the two versions of the tale
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\] about Triton
tells how the women of Tanagra before the orgies of Dionysus went down
to the sea to be purified, were attacked by the Triton as they were
swimming, and prayed that Dionysus would come to their aid. The god, it
is said, heard their cry and overcame the Triton in the fight.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.20.5">

The other version is less grand but more credible. It says that the
Triton would waylay and lift all the cattle that were driven to the sea.
He used even to attack small vessels, until the people of Tanagra set
out for him a bowl of wine. They say that, attracted by the smell, he
came at once, drank the wine, flung himself on the shore and slept, and
that a man of Tanagra struck him on the neck with an axe and chopped off
his head. For this reason the image has no head. And because they caught
him drunk, it is supposed that it was Dionysus who killed him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.21.1">

I saw another Triton among the curiosities at Rome, less in size than
the one at Tanagra. The Tritons have the following appearance. On their
heads they grow hair like that of marsh frogs not only in color, but
also in the impossibility of separating one hair from another. The rest
of their body is rough with fine scales just as is the shark. Under
their ears they have gills and a man’s nose; but the mouth is broader
and the teeth are those of a beast. Their eyes seem to me blue, and they
have hands, fingers, and nails like the shells of the murex. Under the
breast and belly is a tail like a dolphin’s instead of feet.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.21.2">

I saw also the Ethiopian bulls, called rhinoceroses owing to the fact
that each has one horn
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ceras</span>\] at the end of
the nose \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">rhis</span>\], over
which is another but smaller one, but there is no trace of horns on
their heads. I saw too the Paionian bulls, which are shaggy all over,
but especially about the chest and lower jaw. I saw also Indian camels
with the color of leopards.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.21.3">

There is also a beast called the elk, in form between a deer and a
camel, which breeds in the land of the Celts. Of all the beasts we know
it alone cannot be tracked or seen at a distance by man; sometimes,
however, when men are out hunting other game they fall in with an elk by
luck. Now they say that it smells man even at a great distance, and
dashes down into ravines or the deepest caverns. So the hunters surround
the plain or mountain in a circuit of at least a thousand
stadium-lengths, and, taking care not to break the circle, they keep on
narrowing the area enclosed, and so catch all the beasts inside, the
elks included. But if there chance to be no lair within, there is no
other way of catching the elk.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.21.4">

The beast described by Ctesias in his Indian history, which he says is
called <span custom-style="chs_foreign">martichoras</span> by the
Indians and man-eater by the Greeks, I am inclined to think is the
tiger. But that it has three rows of teeth along each jaw and spikes at
the tip of its tail with which it defends itself at close quarters,
while it hurls them like an archer’s arrows at more distant enemies; all
this is, I think, a false story that the Indians pass on from one to
another owing to their excessive dread of the beast.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.21.5">

They were also deceived about its color, and whenever the tiger showed
itself in the light of the sun it appeared to be a homogeneous red,
either because of its speed, or, if it were not running, because of its
continual twists and turns, especially when it was not seen at close
quarters. And I think that if one were to traverse the most remote parts
of Libya, India or Arabia, in search of such beasts as are found in
Greece, some he would not discover at all, and others would have a
different appearance.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.21.6">

For man is not the only creature that has a different appearance in
different climates and in different countries; the others too obey the
same rule. For instance, the Libyan asps have a different colors
compared with the Egyptian, while in Ethiopia are bred asps quite as
black as the men. So everyone should be neither over-hasty in one’s
judgments, nor incredulous when considering rarities. For instance,
though I have never seen winged snakes I believe that they exist, as I
believe that a Phrygian brought to Ionia a scorpion with wings exactly
like those of locusts.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.22.1">

Beside the sanctuary of Dionysus at Tanagra are three temples, one of
Themis, another of Aphrodite, and the third of Apollo; with Apollo are
joined Artemis and Leto. There are sanctuaries of Hermes Ram-bearer and
of Hermes called Champion. They account for the former surname by a
story that Hermes averted a pestilence from the city by carrying a ram
round the walls; to commemorate this Kalamis made an image of Hermes
carrying a ram upon his shoulders. Whichever of the youths is judged to
be the most handsome goes round the walls at the feast of Hermes,
carrying a lamb on his shoulders.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.22.2">

Hermes Champion is said, on the occasion when an Eretrian fleet put into
Tanagra from Euboea, to have led out the youths to the battle; he
himself, armed with a scraper like a youth, was chiefly responsible for
the rout of the Euboeans. In the sanctuary of the Champion is kept all
that is left of the wild strawberry tree under which they believe that
Hermes was nourished. Near by is a theater and by it a portico. I
consider that the people of Tanagra have better arrangements for the
worship of the gods than any other Greeks. For their houses are in one
place, while the sanctuaries are apart beyond the houses in a clear
space where no men live.

That Glaukos was a fisherman, who, on eating of the grass, turned into a

belief generally accepted; in particular, seafaring men tell every year
many a tale about the soothsaying of Glaukos. Pindar and Aeschylus got a
story about Glaukos from the people of Anthedon. Pindar has not thought
fit to say much about him in his odes, but the story actually supplied

In front of the Proetidian gate at Thebes is the gymnasium called the
Gymnasium of Iolaos and also a race-course, a bank of earth like those
at Olympia and Epidaurus. Here there is also shown a hero-shrine of
Iolaos. That Iolaos himself died at Sardis along with the Athenians and
Thespians who made the crossing with him is admitted even by the Thebans
themselves.

Crossing over the right side of the race-course-for-foot-racing

the tomb \[*mnēma*\] of Pindar. When Pindar was a young man he was once
on his way to Thespiai in the hot season. At about noon he was overcome
with fatigue and, as a result, he fell asleep. Then, while he lay there
a little way off-road, sleeping, some bees flitted over to him and
plastered his lips with their wax.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.23.3">

When his reputation had already spread through all of Greece \[Hellas\],
he was elevated to an even greater height of fame
\[<span custom-style="chstranslitgreek">*doxa*</span>\] by an order of
the Pythian \[priestess\], who told the people of Delphi to allot to
Pindar the equal portion

first-offerings that they offered to Apollo. It is also said that, when
he reached old age, a vision
\[<span custom-style="chstranslitgreek">*opsis*</span>\] came to him in
a dream. As he slept, Persephone stood over him and said that she was
the only one of all the deities
\[<span custom-style="chstranslitgreek">*theoi*</span>\] whom Pindar had
not praised-in-song
\[<span custom-style="chstranslitgreek">*humneîn*</span>\], but she went
on to say that Pindar would make

Soon after that, what-must-happen \[to all\] caught up with Pindar,

From this point to Acraephnium is mainly flat. They say that originally
the city formed part of the territory belonging to Thebes, and I learned
that in later times men of Thebes escaped to it, at the time when
Alexander destroyed Thebes. Weak and old, they could not even get safely
away to Attica, but made their homes here. The town lies on Mount Ptous,
and there are here a temple and image of Dionysus that are worth seeing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.23.6">

About fifteen stadium-lengths away from the city on the right is the
sanctuary of Ptoan Apollo. We are told by Asios in his epic that Ptous,
who gave a surname to Apollo and the name to the mountain, was a son of
Athamas by Themisto. Before the expedition of the Macedonians under
Alexander, in which Thebes was destroyed, there was here an oracle that
never lied. Once too a mail of Europus, of the name of Mys, who was sent
by Mardonios, inquired of the god in his own language, and the god too
gave a response, not in Greek but in the Carian speech.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.23.7">

On crossing Mount Ptous you come to Larymna, a Boeotian city on the
coast, said to have been named after Larymna, the daughter of Cynus. Her
earlier ancestors I shall give in my account of Lokris.[^579] Of old
Larymna belonged to Opus, but when Thebes rose to great power the
citizens of their own accord joined the Boeotians. Here there is a
temple of Dionysus with a standing image. The town has a harbor with
deep water near the shore, and on the mountains commanding the city wild
boars can be hunted.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.24.1">

On the straight road from Acraephnium to the Cephisian, or as it is also
called, the Copaic Lake, is what is styled the Athamantian Plain, on
which, they say, Athamas made his home. Into the lake flows the river
Kephisos, which rises at Lilaea in Phokis, and on sailing across it you
come to Copae, a town lying on the shore of the lake. Homer[^580]
mentions it in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Catalogue</span>.
Here is a sanctuary of Demeter, one of Dionysus and a third of Serapis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.24.2">

According to the Boeotians there were once other inhabited towns near
the lake, Athens and Eleusis, but there occurred a flood one winter
which destroyed them. The fish of the Cephisian Lake are in general no
different from those of other lakes, but the eels there are of great
size and very pleasant to the palate.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.24.3">

On the left of Copae about twelve stadium-lengths from it is Olmones,
and some seven stadium-lengths distant from Olmones is Hyettos both
right from their foundation to the present day have been villages. In my
view Hyettos, as well as the Athamantian plain, belongs to the district
of Orkhomenos. All the stories I heard about Hyettos the Argive and
Olmus, the son of Sisyphus, I shall include in my write-up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sungraphē</span>\] about
Orkhomenos.[^581] In Olmones they did not show me anything that was in
the least worth seeing, but in Hyettos is a temple of Hēraklēs, from
whom the sick may get cures. There is an image not carefully carved, but
of unfinished stone after the ancient fashion.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.24.4">

About twenty stadium-lengths away from Hyettos is Cyrtones. The ancient
name of the town was, they say, Cyrtone. It is built on a high mountain,
and here are a temple and grove of Apollo. There are also standing
images of Apollo and Artemis. There is here too a cool stream of water
rising from a rock. By the spring is a sanctuary of the nymphs, and a
small grove, in which all the trees alike are cultivated.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.24.5">

Going out of Cyrtones, as you cross the mountain you come to Corseia,
under which is a grove of trees that are not cultivated, being mostly
evergreen oaks. A small image of Hermes stands in the open part of the
grove. This is distant from Corseia about half a stadium-length. On
descending to the level you reach a river called the Platanios, which
flows into the sea. On the right of the river the last of the Boeotians
in this part dwell in Halae-on-Sea, which separates the mainland of
Lokris from Euboea.

Very near to the Neistan gate at Thebes is the tomb of Menoeceus, the
son of Creon. He committed suicide in obedience to the oracle from
Delphi, at the time when Polyneikes and the host with him arrived from
Argos. On the tomb of Menoeceus grows a pomegranate tree. If you break
through the outer part of the ripe fruit, you will then find the inside
like blood. This pomegranate tree is still flourishing. The Thebans
assert that they were the first men among whom the vine grew, but they
have now no memorial of it to show.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.2">

Not far from the tomb of Menoeceus is the place where they say the sons
of Oedipus killed each other in a duel. The scene of their fight is
marked by a pillar, upon which is a stone shield. There is shown a place
where according to the Thebans Hērā was deceived by Zeus into giving the
breast to Hēraklēs when he was a baby. The whole of this place is called
the Dragging of Antigone. For when she found that she had not the
strength to lift the body of Polyneikes, in spite of her eager efforts,
a second plan occurred to her, to drag him. So she dragged him right up
to the burning pyre of Eteokles and threw him on it.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.3">

There is a river called Dirce after the wife of Lykos. The story goes
that Antiope was ill-treated by this Dirce, and therefore the children
of Antiope put Dirce to death. Crossing the river you reach the ruins of
the house of Pindar, and a sanctuary of the Mother Dindymene. Pindar
dedicated the image, and Aristomedes and Sokrates, sculptors of Thebes,
made it. Their custom is to open the sanctuary on one day in each year,
and no more. It was my fortune to arrive on that day, and I saw the
image, which, like the throne, is of Pentelic marble.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.4">

Along the road from the Neistan gate are three sanctuaries. There is a
sanctuary of Themis, with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a
sanctuary of the Fates, while the third is of Zeus of the Market. Zeus
is made of stone; the Fates have no images. A little farther off in the
open stands Hēraklēs, surnamed Nose-docker; the reason for the name is,
as the Thebans say, that Hēraklēs cut off the noses, as an insult, of
the heralds who came from Orkhomenos to demand the tribute.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.5">

Advancing from here twenty-five stadium-lengths you come to a grove of
Cabeirean Demeter and the Maiden. The initiated are permitted to enter
it. The sanctuary of the Cabeiri is some seven stadium-lengths distant
from this grove. I must ask the curious to forgive me if I keep silence
as to who the Cabeiri are, and what is the nature of the ritual
performed in honor of them and of the Mother.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.6">

But there is nothing to prevent my declaring to all what the Thebans say
was the origin of the ritual. They say that once there was in this place
a city, with inhabitants called Cabeiri; and that Demeter came to know
Prometheus, one of the Cabeiri, and Aetnaelis his son, and entrusted
something to their keeping. What was entrusted to them, and what
happened to it, seemed to me a sin to put into writing, but at any rate
the rites are a gift of Demeter to the Cabeiri.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.7">

At the time of the invasion of the Epigonoi and the taking of Thebes,
the Cabeiri were expelled from their homes by the Argives and the rites
for a while ceased to be performed. But they go on to say that
afterwards Pelarge, the daughter of Potnieus, and Isthmiades her husband
established the mysteries here to begin with, but transferred them to
the place called Alexiarus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.8">

But because Pelarge conducted the initiation outside the ancient
borders, Telondes and those who were left of the clan of the Cabeiri
returned again to Cabeiraea. Various honors were to be established for
Pelarge by Telondes in accordance with an oracle from Dodona, one being
the sacrifice of a pregnant victim. The wrath of the Cabeiri no man may
placate, as has been proved on many occasions.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.9">

For certain private people dared to perform in Naupaktos the ritual just
as it was done in Thebes, and soon afterwards justice overtook them.
Then, again, certain men of the army of Xerxes left behind with
Mardonios in Boeotia entered the sanctuary of the Cabeiri, perhaps in
the hope of great wealth, but rather, I suspect, to show their contempt
of its gods; all these immediately were struck with madness, and flung
themselves to their deaths into the sea or from the tops of precipices.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.25.10">

Again, when Alexander after his victory wasted with fire all the
Thebaid, including Thebes itself, some men from Macedonia entered the
sanctuary of the Cabeiri, as it was in enemy territory, and were
destroyed by thunder and lightning from the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.26.1">

So sacred this sanctuary has been from the beginning. On the right of
the sanctuary is a plain named after Tenerus the seer, whom they hold to
be a son of Apollo by Melia; there is also a large sanctuary of Hēraklēs
surnamed Hippodetos (Binder of Horses). For they say that the
Orkhomenians came to this place with an army, and that Hēraklēs by night
took their chariot-horses and bound them tight.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.26.2">

Farther on we come to the mountain from which they say the Sphinx,
chanting a riddle, sallied to bring death upon those she caught. Others
say that roving with a force of ships on a piratical expedition she put
in at Anthedon, seized the mountain I mentioned, and used it for
plundering raids until Oedipus overwhelmed her by the superior numbers
of the army he had with him on his arrival from Corinth.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.26.3">

There is another version of the story which makes her the natural
daughter of Laios, who, because he was fond of her, told her the oracle
delivered to Kadmos from Delphi. No one, they say, except the kings knew
the oracle. Now Laios (the story goes on to say) had sons by concubines,
and the oracle delivered from Delphi applied only to Epicaste and her
sons. So when any of her brothers came in order to claim the throne from
the Sphinx, she resorted to trickery in dealing with them, saying that
if they were sons of Laios they should know the oracle that came to
Kadmos.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.26.4">

When they could not answer she would punish them with death, on the
ground that they had no valid claim to the kingdom or to relationship.
But Oedipus came because it appears he had been told the oracle in a
dream.

Distant from this mountain fifteen stadium-lengths are the ruins of the

Taking a turn left from the Cabeirian sanctuary, and advancing about
fifty stadium-lengths, you come to Thespiae, built at the foot of Mount
Helicon. They say that Thespia was a daughter of Asopos, who gave her
name to the city, while others say that Thespios, who was descended from
Erekhtheus, came from Athens and was the man after whom the city was
called.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.26.7">

In Thespiaiis a bronze image of Zeus Savior. They say about it that when
a dragon once was devastating their city, the god commanded that every
year one of their youths, upon whom the lot fell, should be offered to
the monster. Now the names of those who perished they say that they do
not remember. But when the lot fell on Kleostratos, his lover
Menestratos, they say, devised a trick.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.26.8">

He had made a bronze breastplate, with a fish-hook, the point turned
outwards, upon each of its plates. Clad in this breastplate he gave
himself up, of his own free will, to the dragon, convinced that having
done so he would, though destroyed himself, prove the destroyer of the
monster. This is why the Zeus has been surnamed Savior. The image of
Dionysus, and also that of Fortune, and in another place that of Hygieia

Of the gods the Thespians have from the beginning honored Love most, and
they have a very ancient image of him, an unfinished stone. Who
established among the Thespians the custom of worshipping Love more than
any other god I do not know. He is worshipped equally by the people of
Parium on the Hellespont, who were originally colonists from Erythraiin
Ionia, but today are subject to the Romans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.27.2">

Most men consider Love to be the youngest of the gods and the son of
Aphrodite. But Olen the Lycian, who composed the oldest Greek hymns,
says in a hymn to Eileithuia that she was the mother of Love. Later than
Olen, both Pamphos and Orpheus wrote hexameter verse, and composed poems
on Love, in order that they might be among those sung by the Lykomidai
to accompany the ritual. I read them after conversation with a
Torchbearer. Of these things I will make no further mention.
Hesiod,[^583] or he who wrote the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Theogony</span> fathered on Hesiod,
writes, I know, that Chaos was born first, and after Chaos, Earth,
Tartarus and Love.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.27.3">

Sappho of Lesbos wrote many poems about Love, but they are not
consistent. Later on Lysippos made a bronze Love for the Thespians, and
previously Praxiteles one of Pentelic marble. The story of Phryne and
the trick she played on Praxiteles I have related in another
place.[^584] The first to remove the image of Love, it is said, was
Gaius the Roman Emperor; Claudius, they say, sent it back to Thespiae,
but Nero carried it away a second time.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.27.4">

At Rome the image perished by fire. Of the pair who sinned against the
god, Gaius was killed by a private soldier, just as he was giving the
password; he had made the soldier very angry by always giving the same
password with a covert sneer. The other, Nero, in addition to his
violence to his mother, committed accursed and hateful crimes against
his wedded wives. The modern Love at Thespiaiwas made by the Athenian
Menodoros, who copied the work of Praxiteles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.27.5">

Here too are statues made by Praxiteles himself, one of Aphrodite and
one of Phryne, both Phryne and the goddess being of stone. Elsewhere too
is a sanctuary of Black Aphrodite, with a theater and a marketplace,
well worth seeing. Here is set up Hesiod in bronze. Not far from the
marketplace is a Victory of bronze and a small temple of the Muses. In
it are small images made of stone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.27.6">

At Thespiaiis also a sanctuary of Hēraklēs. The priestess there is a
virgin, who acts as such until she dies. The reason of this is said to
be as follows. Hēraklēs, they say, had intercourse with the fifty
daughters of Thestios, except one, in a single night. She was the only
one who refused to have connection with him. Hēraklēs,thinking that he
had been insulted, condemned her to remain a virgin all her life,
serving him as his priest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.27.7">

I have heard another story, how Hēraklēs had connection with all the
virgin daughters of Thestios in one and the same night, and how they all
bore him sons, the youngest and the eldest bearing twins. But I cannot
think it credible that Hēraklēs would rise to such a pitch of wrath
against a daughter of a friend. Moreover, while he was still among men,
punishing them for insolence, and especially such as were impious
towards the gods, he would not himself have set up a temple and
appointed a priestess to himself, just as though he were a god.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.27.8">

As a matter of fact this sanctuary seemed to me too old to be of the
time of Hēraklēs the son of Amphitryon, and to belong to Hēraklēs called
one of the Idaean Dactyls, to whom I found the people of Erythraiin
Ionia and of Tyre possessed sanctuaries. Nevertheless, the Boeotians
were not unacquainted with this name of Hēraklēs, seeing that they
themselves say that the sanctuary of Demeter of Mykalessos has been
entrusted to Idaean Hēraklēs.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.28.1">

Helicon is one of the mountains of Greece with the most fertile soil and
the greatest number of cultivated trees. The wild-strawberry bushes
supply to the goats sweeter fruit than that growing anywhere else. The
dwellers around Helicon say that all the grasses too and roots growing
on the mountain are not at all poisonous to men. Moreover, the food
makes the poison of the snakes too less deadly, so that most of those
bitten escape with their lives, should they fall in with a Libyan of
thelineage of the Psyllians, or with any suitable remedies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.28.2">

Now the poison of the most venomous snakes is of itself deadly to men
and all animals alike, but what they feed on contributes very much to
the strength of their poison; for instance, I learned from a Phoenician
that the roots they eat make more venomous the vipers in the highland of
Phoenicia. He said that he had himself seen a man trying to escape from
the rush of a viper; the man, he said, ran up a tree, but the viper,
coming up too late, puffed some of its poison towards the tree, and the
man died instantaneously.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.28.3">

Such was the story I heard from him. Those vipers in Arabia that nest
around the balsam trees have, I know, the following peculiarities. The
balsams are about as big as a myrtle bush, and their leaves are like
those of the herb marjoram. The vipers of Arabia lodge in certain
numbers, larger or smaller, under each tree. For the balsam-juice is the
food they like most, and moreover they are fond of the shade of the
bushes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.28.4">

So when the time has come for the Arabians to collect the juice of the
balsam, each man takes two sticks to the vipers, and by striking them
together they drive the vipers away. Kill them they will not,
considering them sacred to the balsam. And even if a man should have the
misfortune to be bitten by the vipers, though the wound is like the cut
of a knife, nevertheless there is no fear from the poison. For as the
vipers feed on the most fragrant of perfumes, their poison is mitigated
and less deadly.

Such is the truth about these things. The first to sacrifice on Helicon

This poem of Hegesinos I have not read, for it was no longer extant when
I was born. But Kallippos of Corinth in his history of Orkhomenos uses
the verses of Hegesinos as evidence in support of his own views, and I
too have done likewise, using the quotation of Kallippos himself. Of
Ascra in my day nothing memorable was left except one tower. The sons of
Aloeus held that the Muses were three in number, and gave them the names
of Meletē ‘Practice’, Mnēmē ‘Memory’, and Aoidē ‘Song’.

But they say that afterwards Pieros, a man from Macedon, after whom the
mountain in Macedonia was named, came to Thespiai and established nine
Muses, changing their names to the present ones. Pieros was of this
opinion either because it seemed to him wiser, or because an oracle so
ordered, or having so learned from one of the Thracians. For the people
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ethnos</span>\] of Thrace had
the reputation of old of being more adept
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dexion</span>\] than the
people \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ethnos</span>\] of
Macedon, and in particular of being not so careless in matters

There are some who say that Pieros himself had nine daughters, that
their names were the same as those of the goddesses, and that those whom
the Greeks called the children of the Muses were sons of the daughters
of Pieros. Mimnermus, who composed elegiac verses about the battle
between the people of Smyrna and the people of Lydia during the reign of
Gyges, says in his prelude
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prooímion</span>\] that the
elder Muses are daughters of Ouranos, and that there are other and
younger Muses, children of Zeus.

On Helicon, on the left as you go to the grove of the Muses, is the
spring Aganippe; they say that Aganippe was a daughter of the Termessus,
which flows round Helicon. As you go along the straight road to the
grove is a portrait of Eupheme carved in relief on a stone. She was,
they say, the nurse of the Muses.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.29.6">

So her portrait is here, and after it is Linos on a small rock worked
into the shape of a cave. To Linos every year they sacrifice as to a
hero before they sacrifice to the Muses. It is said that this Linos was
a son of Ourania and Amphimaros, a son of Poseidon, that he won a
reputation for the art-of-the-Muses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mousikē</span>\] greater than
that of any contemporary or predecessor, and that Apollo killed him for
being his rival in singing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.29.7">

On the death of Linos, mourning for him spread, it seems, to all the
barbarian world, so that even among the Egyptians there came to be a
Linos song, in the Egyptian language called Maneros. Of the Greek poets,
Homer shows that he knew that the sufferings of Linos were the theme of
a Greek song when he says that Hephaistos, among the other scenes he
worked upon the shield of Achilles, represented a boy harpist singing
the Linos song:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“In the midst of them a boy on a clear-toned lyre

Pamphos, who composed the oldest Athenian hymns, called him Oitolinos
(Linos doomed) at the time when the mourning for Linos was at its
height. Sappho of Lesbos, who learned the name of Oitolinos from the
epic poetry of Pamphos, sang of both Adonis and Oitolinos together. The
Thebans assert that Linos was buried among them, and that after the
Greek defeat at Khaironeia, Philip the son of Amyntas, in obedience to a
vision in a dream, took up the bones of Linos and conveyed them to
Macedonia;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.29.9">

other visions induced him to send the bones of Linos back to Thebes. But
all that was over the tomb, and whatever marks were on it, vanished,
they say, with the lapse of time. Other tales are told by the Thebans,
how later than this Linos there was born another, called the son of
Ismenios, a teacher of music, and how Hēraklēs, while still a child,
killed him. But hexameter poetry was written neither by Linos the son of
Amphimarus nor by the later Linos; or if it was, it has not survived for
posterity.

The first images of the Muses are of them all, from the hand of
Kephisodotos, while a little farther on are three, also from the hand of
Kephisodotos, and three more by Strongylion, an excellent artist of oxen
and horses. The remaining three were made by Olympiosthenes. There is
also on Helicon a bronze Apollo fighting with Hermes for the lyre. There
is also a Dionysus by Lysippos; the standing image, however, of
Dionysus, that Sulla dedicated, is the most noteworthy of the works of
Myron after the Erekhtheus in Athens. What he dedicated was not his own;
he took it away from the Minyai of Orkhomenos. This is an illustration

Hesiod too sits holding a harp upon his knees, a thing not at all
appropriate for Hesiod to carry, for his own verses[^586] make it clear
that he sang holding a laurel wand. As to the age of Hesiod and Homer, I

By the side of Orpheus the Thracian stands a statue of Telete, and
around him are beasts of stone and bronze listening to his singing.
There are many untruths believed by the Greeks, one of which is that
Orpheus was a son of the Muse Kalliope, and not of the daughter of
Pierus, that the beasts followed him fascinated by his songs, and that
he went down alive to Hades to ask for his wife from the gods below. In
my opinion Orpheus excelled his predecessors in the beauty of his verse,
and reached a high degree of power because he was believed to have
discovered mysteries, purification from sins, cures of diseases and
means of averting divine wrath.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.30.5">

But they say that the women of the Thracians plotted his death, because
he had persuaded their husbands to accompany him in his wanderings, but
dared not carry out their intention through fear of their husbands.
Flushed with wine, however, they dared the deed, and hereafter the
custom of their men has been to march to battle drunk. Some say that
Orpheus came to his end by being struck by a thunderbolt, hurled at him
by the god because he revealed sayings in the mysteries to men who had
not heard them before.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.30.6">

Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he
came to Aornum in Thesprotis, where of old was an oracle of the dead. He
thought, they say, that the soul of Eurydikē followed him, but turning
round he lost her, and committed suicide for grief. The Thracians say
that such nightingales as nest on the tomb of Orpheus sing more sweetly
and louder than others.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.30.7">

The Macedonians who dwell in the district below Mount Pieria and the
city of Dium say that it was here that Orpheus met his end at the hands
of the women. Going from Dium along the road to the mountain, and
advancing twenty stadium-lengths, you come to a pillar on the right
surmounted by a stone urn, which according to the natives contains the
bones of Orpheus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.30.8">

There is also a river called Helicon. After a course of seventy-five
stadium-lengths the stream hereupon disappears under the earth. After a
gap of about twenty-two stadium-lengths the water rises again, and under
the name of Baphyra instead of Helicon flows into the sea as a navigable
river. The people of Dium say that at first this river flowed on land
throughout its course. But, they go on to say, the women who killed
Orpheus wished to wash off in it the blood-stains, and thereat the river
sank underground, so as not to lend its waters to purify manslaughter.

In Larisa I heard another story, how on Olympus is a city Libethra,
where the mountain faces, Macedonia, not far from which city is the tomb
of Orpheus. The Libethrians, it is said, received out of Thrace an
oracle from Dionysus, stating that when the sun should see the bones of
Orpheus, then the city of Libethra would be destroyed by a boar. The
citizens paid little regard to the oracle, thinking that no other beast
was big or mighty enough to take their city, while a boar was bold
rather than powerful.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.30.10">

But when it seemed good to the god the following events befell the
citizens. About midday a shepherd was asleep leaning against the tomb of
Orpheus, and even as he slept he began to sing poetry of Orpheus in a
loud and sweet voice. Those who were pasturing or tilling nearest to him
left their several tasks and gathered together to hear the shepherd sing
in his sleep. And jostling one another and striving who could get
nearest the shepherd they overturned the pillar, the urn fell from it
and broke, and the sun saw whatever was left of the bones of Orpheus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.30.11">

Immediately when night came the god sent heavy rain, and the river Sys
(Boar), one of the torrents about Olympus, on this occasion threw down
the walls of Libethra, overturning sanctuaries of gods and houses of
men, and drowning the inhabitants and all the animals in the city. When
Libethra was now a city of ruin, the Macedonians in Dium, according to
my friend of Larisa, carried the bones of Orpheus to their own country.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.30.12">

Whoever has devoted himself to the study of poetry knows that the hymns
of Orpheus are all very short, and that the total number of them is not
great. The Lykomidai know them and chant them over the ritual of the
mysteries. For poetic beauty they may be said to come next to the hymns
of Homer, while they have been even more honored by the gods.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.31.1">

On Helicon there is also a statue of Arsinoe, who married Ptolemy her
brother. She is being carried by a bronze ostrich. Ostriches grow wings
just like other birds, but their bodies are so heavy and large that the
wings cannot lift them into the air.

Here too is Telephus, the son of Hēraklēs, represented as a baby being
suckled by a deer. By his side is an ox, and an image of Priapus worth
seeing. This god is worshipped where goats and sheep pasture or there

than any other god, being called by them a son of Dionysus and
Aphrodite.

On Helicon tripods have been dedicated, of which the oldest is the one
which it is said Hesiod received for winning the prize for song at
Chalcis on the Euripus. Men too live round about the grove, and here the
Thespians celebrate a festival, and also games called the Museia. They
celebrate other games in honor of Love, offering prizes not only for
music but also for athletic events. Ascending about twenty
stadium-lengths from this grove is what is called the Horse’s Fountain
(Hippocrene). It was made, they say, by the horse of Bellerophon
striking the ground with his hoof.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.31.4">

The Boeotians dwelling around Helicon hold the tradition that Hesiod
wrote nothing but the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Works</span>,
and even of this they reject the prelude to the Muses, saying that the
poem begins with the account of the Strifes.[^587] They showed me also a
tablet of lead where the spring is, mostly defaced by time, on which is
engraved the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Works</span>.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.31.5">

There is another tradition, very different from the first, that Hesiod
wrote a great number of poems; the one on women, the one called the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Great Eoeae</span>, the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Theogony</span>, the poem on the seer
Melampos, the one on the descent to Hades of Theseus and Peirithoös, the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Precepts of Kheiron</span>,
professing to be for the instruction of Achilles, and other poems
besides the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Works and Days</span>.
These same Boeotians say that Hesiod learned seercraft from the
Acarnanians, and there are extant a poem called
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Mantika</span> (Seercraft), which I
myself have read, and interpretations of portents.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.31.6">

Opposite stories are also told of Hesiod’s death. All agree that
Ctimenus and Antiphus, the sons of Ganyctor, fled from Naupaktos to
Molycria because of the murder of Hesiod, that here they sinned against
Poseidon, and that in Molycria their punishment was inflicted. The
sister of the young men had been ravished; some say the deed was
Hesiod’s, and others that Hesiod was wrongly thought guilty of another’s
crime. So widely different are the traditions of Hesiod himself and his
poems.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.31.7">

On the summit of Helicon is a small river called the Lamus.[^588] In the
territory of the Thespians is a place called Donacon (Reed-bed). Here is
the spring of Narcissus. They say that Narcissus looked into this water,
and not understanding that he saw his own reflection, unconsciously fell
in love with himself, and died of love at the spring. But it is utter
stupidity to imagine that a man old enough to fall in love was incapable
of distinguishing a man from a man’s reflection.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.31.8">

There is another story about Narcissus, less popular indeed than the
other, but not without some support. It is said that Narcissus had a
twin sister; they were exactly alike in appearance, their hair was the
same, they wore similar clothes, and went hunting together. The story
goes on that Narcissus fell in love with his sister, and when the girl
died, would go to the spring, knowing that it was his reflection that he
saw, but in spite of this knowledge finding some relief for his love in
imagining that he saw, not his own reflection, but the likeness of his
sister.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.31.9">

The flower narcissus grew, in my opinion, before this, if we are to
judge by the verses of Pamphos. This poet was born many years before
Narcissus the Thespian, and he says that the Maiden, the daughter of
Demeter, was carried off when she was playing and gathering flowers, and
that the flowers by which she was deceived into being carried off were
not violets, but the narcissus.

Creusis, the harbor of Thespiae, has nothing to show publicly, but at
the home of a private person I found an image of Dionysus made of gypsum

straight sea-crossing is impossible, and at the same time violent gales
blow down from the mountains.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.32.2">

Sailing from Creusis, not out to sea, but along Boeotia, you reach on
the right a city called Thisbe. First there is a mountain by the sea; on
crossing it you will come to a plain, and after that to another
mountain, at the foot of which is the city. Here there is a sanctuary of
Hēraklēs with a standing image of stone, and they hold a festival called
the Herakleia.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.32.3">

Nothing would prevent the plain between the mountains becoming a lake
owing to the volume of the water, had they not made a strong dyke right
through it. So every other year they divert the water to the farther
side of the dyke, and farm the other side. Thisbe, they say, was a nymph
of the country, from whom the city has received its name.

As you go inland from Thespiaiyou come to Haliartos. The question who
became founder of Haliartos and KorōneiaI cannot separate from my
account about the people of Orkhomenos.[^589] At the Persian invasion
the people of Haliartos sided with the Greeks, and so a division of the
army of Xerxes overran and burned both their territory and their city.
In Haliartos is the tomb of Lysander the Lacedaemonian. For having
attacked the walls of Haliartos, in which were troops from Thebes and
Athens, he fell in the fighting that followed a sortie of the enemy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.32.6">

Lysander in some ways is worthy of the greatest praise, in others of the
sharpest blame. He certainly showed cleverness in the following ways.
When in command of the Peloponnesian triremes he waited till Alcibiades
was away from the fleet, and then led on Antiokhos, the pilot of
Alcibiades, to believe that he was a match for the Lacedaemonians at
sea, and when in the rashness of vainglory he put out to sea, Lysander
overcame him not far from the city of Kolophon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.32.7">

And when for the second time he arrived from Sparta to take charge of
the triremes, he so tamed Cyrus that, whenever he asked for money to pay
the fleet, he received it in good time and without stint. When the
Athenian fleet of one hundred ships anchored at Aigospotamoi, waiting
until the sailors were scattered to get water and provisions, he thus
captured their vessels. He showed the following example of justice.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.32.8">

A competitor at the pankration, Autolykos, whose statue I saw in the
Prytaneion of the Athenians, had a dispute about some piece of property
with Eteonikos of Sparta. When Eteonikos was convicted of making unjust
statements, as the rule of the Thirty was then supreme in Athens, and
Lysander had not yet departed, Eteonikos was encouraged to make an
unprovoked assault, and when Autolykos resisted, summoned him before
Lysander, confidently expecting that judgment would be given in his
favor. But Lysander gave judgment against Eteonikos and dismissed him
with a reprimand.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.32.9">

All this redounds to the credit of Lysander, but the following incidents
are a reproach. Philokles, the Athenian commander-in-chief at
Aigospotamoi, along with four thousand other Athenian prisoners, were
put to death by Lysander, who even refused them burial afterwards, a
thing which even the Persians who landed at Marathon received from the
Athenians, and the Lacedaemonians themselves who fell at Thermopylae
received from King Xerxes. Lysander brought a yet deeper disgrace upon
the Lacedaemonians by the Commissions of Ten he set over the cities and
by the Laconian governors.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.32.10">

Again, an oracle had warned the Lacedaemonians that only love of money
could destroy Sparta, and so they were not used to acquiring wealth, yet
Lysander aroused in the Spartans a strong desire for riches. I for my
part follow the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\], and judge by
their law, and decide that Lysander brought on the Lacedaemonians more
harm than benefit.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.33.1">

In Haliartos too there is the tomb of Lysander and a hero-shrine of
Kekrops the son of Pandion. Mount Tilphousios and the spring called
Tilphousa are about fifty stadium-lengths away from Haliartos. The
Greeks declare that the Argives, along with the sons of Polyneikes,
after capturing Thebes, were bringing Teiresias and some other of the
spoil to the god at Delphi, when Teiresias, being thirsty, drank by the
wayside of the Tilphousa, and forthwith gave up his breath-of-life
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">psūkhē</span>\]; his tomb
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\] is next to the

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.33.2">

They say that the daughter of Teiresias was given to Apollo by the
Argives, and at the command of the god crossed with ships to the
Kolophonian land in what is now called Ionia. Manto there married
Rhakios, a Cretan. The rest of the history of Teiresias is known to all
as a tradition: the number of years it is recorded that he lived, how he
changed from a woman to a man, and that Homer in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>[^590] represents
Teiresias as the only one in Hades who is conscious

At Haliartos there is in the open a sanctuary of the goddesses they call
Praxidikai \[those who exact
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span> ‘punishment’\]. Here
they swear, but they do not make the oath rashly. The sanctuary of the
goddesses is near Mount Tilphousios. In Haliartos are temples, with no

these temples were built.

In the land of Haliartos there is a river Lophis. It is said that the
land was originally arid and without water, so that one of the rulers
came to Delphi and asked in what way they would find water in the land.
The Pythian priestess, they say, commanded him to kill the man who
should first meet him on his return to Haliartos. On his arrival he was
met by his son Lophis, and at once struck down the youth with his sword.
Still living, the boy ran about, and where the blood ran water rose up
from the earth. And so, the river is called Lophis.

Alalkomenai is a small village
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmē</span>\], and it lies at

derived from Alalkomeneus, an aboriginal
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">autokhthōn</span>\], by whom
Athena was brought up; others declare that Alalkomeniā was one of the
daughters of Ogygos. At some distance from the village
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmē</span>\] on the level
ground has been made a temple

Sulla’s treatment of the Athenians was savage and foreign to the Roman
character, but quite consistent with his treatment of Thebes and
Orkhomenos. But in Alalkomenai he added yet another to his crimes by
robbing the statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] of Athena
itself. After these mad outrages against the Greek cities and the gods
of the Greeks he was attacked by the most foul of diseases. He broke out
with an infestation of lice, and what was formerly accounted his good
fortune came to such an end. The sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] at

In my time yet another incident added to the ruin of the temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāos</span>\]. A large and

Before arriving at Korōneia from Alalkomenai there is the sanctuary

Itōniā. It is named after Itōnios son of Amphiktyon, and here the

The distance from Korōneia to Mount Laphystios and the precinct

Laphysios is about twenty stadium-lengths. The statue
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalma</span>\] is of stone.
They say that when Athamas was about to sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] here Phrixos
and Hellē, a ram with his fleece of gold was sent by Zeus to the
children, and that on the back of this ram they escaped. Higher up is a
Hēraklēs invoked by the epithet Kharops \[‘with favoring looks’\]ith
bright eyes\]. Here, say the Boeotians, Hēraklēs came-up-from-under
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-bênai</span>\] with the

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] of Athena
Itōniā is the river Phalaros, which runs into the lake Kēphisís.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.34.6">

Beyond Mount Laphystios is Orkhomenos, as famous a Greek city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] as any. Once
raised to the greatest heights of prosperity, it too was fated to fall
almost as low as Mycenae and Delos. The extent of their ancient
traditions they memorialize
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmoneuein</span>\] as
follows . They say that Andreus, son of the river Pēneios, was the first
to settle \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ep-oikeîn</span>\]
here, and after him the land was named Andrēís.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.34.7">

Then, after Athamas arrived on the scene, he \[Andreus\] assigned
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-nemein</span>\] to him, of
his own land, the territory round Mount Laphystios, along with what are
now the territories of Korōneia and Haliartos. Athamas, thinking that
none of his male children were left, adopted Haliartos and Korōnos, the
sons of Thersandros, the son of Sisyphus, his brother. For he himself
had put to death Learkhos and Melikertes; Leukōn had fallen sick and
died; while as for Phrixos, Athamas did not know if he survived or had
descendants surviving.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.34.8">

When later Phrixos himself, according to some, or Presbōn, according to
others, returned from Kolkhis—Presbōn was a son of Phrixos by the
daughter of Aiētēs—the sons of Thersandros agreed that the house of
Athamas belonged to Athamas and his descendants, while they themselves
became founders of Haliartos and Korōneia, for Athamas gave them a part
of his land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.34.9">

Even before this, Andreus took awayfrom Athamas that man’s wife,
Euhippē, daughter of Leukōn, to be his own wife, and he had with her a
son, Eteokles. According to the talk
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] of the
people-of-the-city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polītai</span>\], Eteokles was
the son of the river Kēphisos, and for that reason some who make-poetry
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] called him
Kēphisiadēs in their verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epos</span> plural\].

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.34.10">

When this Eteokles became king, he let the country be still called after
Andreus, but he established two city-divisions
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phūlai</span>\], naming one
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phūlē</span>\] Kēphisiás, and
the other after himself. When Almos, the son of Sisyphus, came to him,
he gave him to dwell-in a little of the land, and these settlements
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmai</span>\] were then
called Almōnes after this Almos. Afterwards the name of the settlement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kōmē</span>\]that was

they know that he was the one who established three as the number of the
Graces \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kharites</span>\], but
they do not memorialize
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmoneuein</span>\] the names
that he gave them. The Lacedaemonians, however, say that the Graces
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kharites</span>\] are two, and

Pamphōs was the first we know of to sing

what-has-been-poetically-created \[perfect passive

nothing about their number or about their names. Homer[^591] also
memorializes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmoneuein</span>\] the
Graces \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kharites</span>\],and
he says that one is the wife of Hephaistos, and he gives her the name
Grace \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kharis</span>\]. He also
says that Sleep \[Hypnos\] was a lover of Pasithea, and in the speech of
Sleep there is this verse

Hesiod in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Theogony</span>[^592]
(though the authorship is doubtful, this poem is good evidence) says
that the Graces are daughters of Zeus and Eurynome, giving them the
names of Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia. The poem of Onomacritus agrees
with this account. Antimakhos, while giving neither the number of the
Graces nor their names, says that they are daughters of Aigle and the
Sun. The elegiac poet Hermesianax disagrees with his predecessors in
that he makes Persuasion also one of the Graces.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.35.6">

Who it was who first represented the Graces naked, whether in sculpture
or in painting, I could not discover. During the earlier period,
certainly, sculptors and painters alike represented them draped. At
Smyrna, for instance, in the sanctuary of the Nemeses, above the images
have been dedicated Graces of gold, the work of Bupalus; and in the
Music Hall in the same city there is a portrait of a Grace, painted by
Apelles. At Pergamon likewise, in the chamber of Attalus, are other
images of Graces made by Bupalus;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.35.7">

and near what is called the Pythium there is a portrait of Graces,
painted by Pythagoras the Parian. Socrates too, son of Sophroniskos,
made statues \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">agalmata</span>\]
of Graces \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Kharites</span>\]
for the Athenians, which are situated in front of the entrance to the
Acropolis. All these are alike draped; but later artists, I do not know
the reason, have changed the way of portraying them. Certainly today
sculptors and painters represent Graces naked.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.1">

When Eteokles died the kingdom devolved on the lineage of Almus. Almus
himself had daughters born to him, Khrysogeneia and Khryse. Tradition
has it that Khryse, daughter of Almus, had by Ares a son Phlegyas, who,
as Eteokles died childless, got the throne. To the whole country they
gave the name of Phlegyantis instead of Andreis,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.2">

and besides the originally founded city of Andreis, Phlegyas founded
another, which he named after himself, collecting into it the best
soldiers in Greece. In course of time the foolhardy and reckless
Phlegyans seceded from Orkhomenos and began to ravage their neighbors.
At last they even marched against the sanctuary at Delphi to raid it,
when Philammon with picked men of Argos went out to meet them, but he
and his picked men perished in the engagement.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.3">

That the Phlegyans took more pleasure in war than any other Greeks is
also shown by the lines of the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> dealing with Ares and
his son Panic:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“They twain were arming themselves for war to go to the Ephyrians,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Or to the great-hearted Phlegyans.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 13.301–302

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

By Ephyrians in this passage Homer means, I think, those in Thesprotis.
The Phlegyan people were completely overthrown by the god with continual
thunderbolts and violent earthquakes. The remnant were wasted by an
epidemic of plague, but a few of them escaped to Phokis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.4">

Phlegyas had no sons, and Khryses succeeded to the throne, a son of
Poseidon by Khrysogeneia, daughter of Almus. This Khryses had a son
called Minyas, and after him the people over whom he ruled are still
called Minyans. The revenues that Minyas received were so great that he
surpassed his predecessors in wealth, and he was the first man we know
of to build a treasury to receive his riches.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.5">

The Greeks appear apt to regard with greater wonder foreign sights than
sights at home. For whereas distinguished historians have described the
Egyptian pyramids with the minutest detail, they have not made even the
briefest mention of the treasury of Minyas and the walls of Tiryns,
though these are no less marvelous.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.6">

Minyas had a son Orkhomenos, in whose reign the city was called
Orkhomenos and the men Orkhomenians. Nevertheless, they continued to
bear the additional name of Minyans, to distinguish them from the
Orkhomenians in Arcadia. To this Orkhomenos during his kingship came
Hyettos from Argos, who was an exile because of the slaying of Molurus,
son of Arisbas, whom he caught with his wedded wife and killed.
Orkhomenos assigned to him such of the land as is now around the village
Hyettos, and the land adjacent to this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.7">

Hyettos is also mentioned by the poet who composed the poem called by
the Greeks the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Great Ehoiai</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“And Hyettos killed Molurus, the dear son of Arisbas,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Leaving his home he fled from horse-breeding Argos,

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And reached Minyan Orkhomenos, and the hero

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">The Great Ehoiai</span>, unknown

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.36.8">

This Hyettos was the first man known to have exacted punishment from an
adulterer. Later on, when Dracon was legislator for the Athenians, it
was enacted in the laws which he drew up for the Athenians that the
punishment of an adulterer should be one of the acts condoned by the
State. So high did the reputation of the Minyans stand, that even
Neleus, son of Kretheus, who was king of Pylos, took a wife from
Orkhomenos, namely Chloris, daughter of Amphion, son of Iasios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.1">

But it was destined for the lineage of Almus too to come to an end. For
Orkhomenos left no child, and so the kingdom devolved on Klymenos, son
of Presbon, son of Phrixos. Sons were born to Klymenos; the eldest was
Erginos, the next after him were Stratios, Arrhon and Pyleus, while the
youngest was Azeus. Klymenos was murdered at the feast of Onchestian
Poseidon by men of Thebes, whom a trivial cause had thrown into a
violent passion. So Erginos, the eldest of the sons of Klymenos,
received the kingdom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.2">

Immediately he and his brothers gathered a force and attacked Thebes.
Victorious in the battle, they then came to an agreement that the
Thebans should pay tribute each year for the murder of Klymenos. But
when Hēraklēs had grown to manhood in Thebes, the Thebans were thus
relieved of the tribute, and the Minyans suffered a grievous defeat in
the war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.3">

Erginos, as his citizens had been utterly crushed, made peace with
Hēraklēs, but in his efforts to restore his former wealth and prosperity
neglected everything else, so that unconsciously he came to a wifeless
and childless old age. But when he had gathered riches, the desire
seized him to have children.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.4">

So going to Delphi he inquired of the oracle about children, and the
Pythian priestess gave this reply:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Erginos, son of Klymenos Presboniades,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Late thou camest seeking offspring, but even now

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

To the old plough tree put a new tip.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Obeying the oracle he took to himself a young wife, and had children,
Trophonios and Agamedes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.5">

Trophonios is said to have been a son of Apollo, not of Erginos. This I
am inclined to believe, as does everyone who has gone to Trophonios to
inquire of his oracle. They say that these, when they grew up, proved
clever at building sanctuaries for the gods and palaces for men. For
they built the temple for Apollo at Delphi and the treasury for Hyrieus.
One of the stones in it they made so that they could take it away from
the outside. So they kept on removing something from the store. Hyrieus
was dumbfounded when he saw keys and seals untampered with, while the
treasure kept on getting less.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.6">

So he set over the vessels, in which were his silver and gold, snares or
other contrivance, to arrest any who should enter and lay hands on the
treasure. Agamedes entered and was kept fast in the trap, but Trophonios
cut off his head, lest when day came his brother should be tortured, and
he himself be informed of as being concerned in the crime.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.7">

The earth opened and swallowed up Trophonios at the point in the grove
at Lebadeia where is what is called the pit of Agamedes, with a slab
beside it. The kingdom of Orkhomenos was taken by Ascalaphus and
Ialmenus, said to be sons of Ares, while their mother was Astyoche,
daughter of Aktor, son of Azeus, son of Klymenos. Under the leadership
of these the Minyans marched against Troy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.37.8">

Orkhomenians also joined with the sons of Kodros in the expedition to
Ionia. When expelled from their city by the Thebans they were restored
again to Orkhomenos by Philip the son of Amyntas. But Providence was to
drag them ever lower and lower into decay.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.1">

At Orkhomenos is a sanctuary of Dionysus, but the oldest is one of the
Graces. They worship the stones most, and say that they fell for
Eteokles out of the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\]. The artistic
images were dedicated in my time, and they too are of stone.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.2">

They have also a fountain worth seeing, and go down to it to fetch
water. The treasury of Minyas, a wonder second to none either in Greece
itself or elsewhere, has been built in the following way. It is made of
stone; its shape is round, rising to a rather blunt apex; they say that
the highest stone is the keystone of the whole building.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.3">

There are tombs of Minyas and Hesiod. They say that they thus recovered
the bones of Hesiod. A pestilence fell on men and beasts, so that they
sent envoys to the god. To these, it is said, the Pythian priestess made
answer that to bring the bones of Hesiod from the land of Naupaktos to
the land of Orkhomenos was their one and only remedy. Whereupon the
envoys asked a further question, where in the land of Naupaktos they
would find the bones; to which the Pythian priestess answered again that
a crow would indicate to them the place.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.4">

So when the envoys landed, they saw, it is said, a rock not far from the
road, with the bird upon the rock; the bones of Hesiod they found in a
cleft of the rock. Elegiac verses are inscribed on the tomb:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Ascra rich in wheat was his native land, but when Hesiod died,

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

About Aktaion the Orkhomenians had the following story. A ghost, they
say, carrying a rock[^593] was ravaging the land. When they inquired at
Delphi, the god ordered them to discover the remains of Aktaion and bury
them in the earth. He also ordered them to make a bronze likeness of the
ghost and fasten it to a rock with iron. I have myself seen this image
thus fastened. They also sacrifice every year to Aktaion as to a hero.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.6">

Seven stadium-lengths from Orkhomenos is a temple of Hēraklēs with a
small image. Here is the source of the river Melas (black), one of the
streams running into the Cephisian Lake. The lake at all times covers
the greater part of the Orkhomenian territory, but in the winter season,
after the south-west wind has generally prevailed, the water spreads
over a yet greater extent of the territory.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.7">

The Thebans declare that the river Kephisos was diverted into the
Orkhomenian plain by Hēraklēs, and that for a time it passed under the
mountain and entered the sea, until Hēraklēs blocked up the chasm
through the mountain. Now Homer too knows that the Cephisian Lake was a
lake of itself, and not made by Hēraklēs. Wherefore Homer says:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Sloping towards the Cephisian Lake.”

It is not likely either that the Orkhomenians would not have discovered
the chasm, and, breaking down the work put up by Hēraklēs, have given
back to the Gephisus its ancient passage, since right down to the Trojan
war they were a wealthy people. There is evidence in my favor in the
passage of Homer where Achilles replies to the envoys from Agamemnon:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Not even the wealth that comes to Orkhomenos,”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 9.381

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

a line that clearly shows that even then the revenues coming to
Orkhomenos were large.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.9">

They say that Aspledon was left by the inhabitants because of a shortage
of water. They say also that the city got its name from Aspledon, who
was a son of the nymph Mideia and Poseidon. Their view is confirmed by
some verses composed by Chersias, a man of Orkhomenos:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“To Poseidon and glorious Mideia

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Was born Aspledon in the spacious city.”

Chersias of Orkhomenos, unknown location

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.38.10">

The poem of Chersias was no longer extant in my day, but these verses
are quoted by Kallippos in the same history of Orkhomenos. The
Orkhomenians have a tradition that this Chersias wrote also the
inscription on the tomb of Hesiod.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.1">

On the side towards the mountains the boundary of Orkhomenos is Phokis,
but on the plain it is Lebadeia. Originally this city stood on high
ground, and was called Mideia after the mother of Aspledon. But when
Lebados came to it from Athens, the inhabitants went down to the low
ground, and the city was named Lebadeia after him. Who was the father of
Lebados, and why he came, they do not know; they know only that the wife
of Lebados was Laonikē.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.2">

The city is no less adorned than the most prosperous of the Greek
cities, and it is separated from the grove of Trophonios by the river
Hercyna. They say that here Hercyna, when playing with the Maiden, the
daughter of Demeter, held a goose which against her will she let loose.
The bird flew into a hollow cave and hid under a stone; the Maiden
entered and took the bird as it lay under the stone. The water flowed,
they say, from the place where the Maiden took up the stone, and hence
the river received the name of Hercyna.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.3">

On the bank of the river there is a temple of Hercyna, in which is a
maiden holding a goose in her arms. In the cave are the sources of the
river and images standing, and serpents are coiled around their
scepters. One might conjecture the images to be of Asklepios and
Hygieia, but they might be Trophonios and Hercyna, because they think
that serpents are just as much sacred to Trophonios as to Asklepios. By
the side of the river is the tomb of Arkesilaos, whose bones, they say,
were carried back from Troy by Leitos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.4">

The most famous things in the grove are a temple and image of
Trophonios; the image, made by Praxiteles, is after the likeness of
Asklepios. There is also a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Europa, and a
Zeus Rain-god in the open. If you go up to the oracle, and thence
onwards up the mountain, you come to what is called the Maiden’s Hunting
and a temple of King Zeus. This temple they have left half finished,
either because of its size or because of the long succession of the
wars. In a second temple are images of Kronos, Hērā and Zeus. There is
also a sanctuary of Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.5">

What happens at the oracle is as follows. When a man has made up his
mind to descend to the oracle of Trophonios, he first lodges in a
certain building for an appointed number of days, this being sacred to
the good Spirit and to good Fortune. While he lodges there, among other
regulations for purity he abstains from hot baths, bathing only in the
river Hercyna. Meat he has in plenty from the sacrifices, for he who
descends sacrifices to Trophonios himself and to the children of
Trophonios, to Apollo also and Kronos, to Zeus surnamed King, to Hērā
Charioteer, and to Demeter whom they surname Europa and say was the
nurse of Trophonios.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.6">

At each sacrifice a diviner is present, who looks into the entrails of
the victim, and after an inspection prophesies to the person descending
whether Trophonios will give him a kind and gracious reception. The
entrails of the other victims do not declare the mind of Trophonios so
much as a ram, which each inquirer sacrifices over a pit on the night he
descends, calling upon Agamedes. Even though the previous sacrifices
have appeared propitious, no account is taken of them unless the
entrails of this ram indicate the same; but if they agree, then the
inquirer descends in good hope. The procedure of the descent is this.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.7">

First, during the night he is taken to the river Hercyna by two boys of
the citizens about thirteen years old, named Hermai, who after taking
him there anoint him with oil and wash him. It is these who wash the
descender, and do all the other necessary services as his attendant
boys. After this he is taken by the priests, not at once to the oracle,
but to fountains of water very near to each other.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.8">

Here he must drink water called the water of Forgetfulness, that he may
forget all that he has been thinking of hitherto, and afterwards he
drinks of another water, the water of Memory, which causes him to
remember what he sees after his descent. After looking at the image
which they say was made by Daidalos (it is not shown by the priests save
to such as are going to visit Trophonios), having seen it, worshipped it
and prayed, he proceeds to the oracle, dressed in a linen tunic, with
ribbons girding it, and wearing the boots of the country.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.9">

The oracle is on the mountain, beyond the grove. Round it is a circular
basement of white marble, the circumference of which is about that of
the smallest threshing floor, while its height is just short of two
cubits. On the basement stand spikes, which, like the cross-bars holding
them together, are of bronze, while through them has been made a double
door. Within the enclosure is a chasm in the earth, not natural, but
artificially constructed after the most accurate masonry.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.10">

The shape of this structure is like that of a bread-oven. Its breadth
across the middle one might conjecture to be about four cubits, and its
depth also could not be estimated to extend to more than eight cubits.
They have made no way of descent to the bottom, but when a man comes to
Trophonios, they bring him a narrow, light ladder. After going down he
finds a hole between the floor and the structure. Its breadth appeared
to be two spans, and its height one span.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.11">

The descender lies with his back on the ground, holding barley-cakes
kneaded with honey, thrusts his feet into the hole and himself follows,
trying hard to get his knees into the hole. After his knees the rest of
his body is at once swiftly drawn in, just as the largest and most rapid
river will catch a man in its eddy and carry him under. After this those
who have entered the shrine learn the future, not in one and the same
way in all cases, but by sight sometimes and at other times by hearing.
The return upwards is by the same mouth, the feet darting out first.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.12">

They say that no one who has made the descent has been killed, save only
one of the bodyguard of Demetrios. But they declare that he performed
none of the usual rites in the sanctuary, and that he descended, not to
consult the god but in the hope of stealing gold and silver from the
shrine. It is said that the body of this man appeared in a different
place, and was not cast out at the sacred mouth. Other tales are told
about the fellow, but I have given the one most worthy of consideration.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.13">

After his ascent from Trophonios the inquirer is again taken in hand by
the priests, who set him upon a chair called the chair of Memory, which
stands not far from the shrine, and they ask of him, when seated there,
all he has seen or learned. After gaining this information they then
entrust him to his relatives. These lift him, paralyzed with terror and
unconscious both of himself and of his surroundings, and carry him to
the building where he lodged before with Good Fortune and the Good
Spirit. Afterwards, however, he will recover all his faculties, and the
power to laugh will return to him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.39.14">

What I write is not hearsay; I have myself inquired of Trophonios and
seen other inquirers. Those who have descended into the shrine of
Trophonios are obliged to dedicate a tablet on which is written all that
each has heard or seen. The shield also of Aristomenes is still
preserved here. Its story I have already given in a former part of my
work.[^594]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.1">

This oracle was once unknown to the Boeotians, but they learned of it in
the following way. As there had been no rain for a year and more, they
sent to Delphi envoys from each city. These asked for a cure for the
drought, and were bidden by the Pythian priestess to go to Trophonios at
Lebadeia and to discover the remedy from him.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.2">

Coming to Lebadeia they could not find the oracle. Thereupon Saon, one
of the envoys from the city Acraiphnion and the oldest of all the
envoys, saw a swarm of bees. It occurred to him to follow himself
wheresoever the bees turned. At once he saw the bees flying into the
ground here, and he went with them into the oracle. It is said that
Trophonios taught this Saon the customary ritual, and all the
observances kept at the oracle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.3">

Of the works of Daidalos there are these two in Boeotia, a Hēraklēs in
Thebes and the Trophonios at Lebadeia. There are also two wooden images
in Crete, a Britomartis at Olus and an Athena at Knossos, at which
latter place is also Ariadne’s Khoros \[‘place for dancing and
singing’\], mentioned by Homer in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>,[^595] carved in relief
on white marble. At Delos, too, there is a small wooden image of
Aphrodite, its right hand defaced by time, and with a square base
instead of feet.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.4">

I am of opinion that Ariadne got this image from Daidalos, and when she
followed Theseus, took it with her from home. Bereft of Ariadne, say the
Delians, Theseus dedicated the wooden image of the goddess to the Delian
Apollo, lest by taking it home he should be dragged into remembering
Ariadne, and so find the grief for his love ever renewed. I know of no
other works of Daidalos still in existence. For the images dedicated by
the Argives in the Hēraion and those brought from Omphace to Gela in
Sicily have disappeared in course of time.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.5">

Next to Lebadeia comes Khaironeia. Its name of old was Arne, said to
have been a daughter of Aiolos, who gave her name also to a city in
Thessaly. The present name of Khaironeia, they say, is derived from
Khairon, reputed to be a son of Apollo by Thero, a daughter of Phylas.
This is confirmed also by the writer of the epic poem, the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Great Ehoiai</span>:

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Homer, I think, though he knew that Khaironeia and Lebadeia were already
so called, yet uses their ancient names, just as he speaks of the river
Aigyptos, not the Nile.[^596]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.7">

In the territory of Khaironeia are two trophies, which the Romans under
Sulla set up to commemorate their victory over the army of Mithridates
under Taxilos. But Philip, son of Amyntas, set up no trophy, neither
here nor for any other success, whether won over Greeks or barbarians,
as the Macedonians were not accustomed to raise trophies.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.8">

The Macedonians say that Caranus, king of Macedonia, overcame in battle
Cisseus, a chieftain in a bordering country. For his victory Caranus set
up a trophy after the Argive fashion, but it is said to have been upset
by a lion from Olympus, which then vanished.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.9">

Caranus, they assert, realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur
the undying hatred of the barbarians dwelling around, and so, they say,
the rule was adopted that no king of Macedonia, neither Caranus himself
nor any of his successors, should set up trophies, if they were ever to
gain the goodwill of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the
fact that Alexander set up no trophies, neither for his victory over
Dareios nor for those he won in India.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.10">

As you approach the city you see a common grave of the Thebans who were
killed in the struggle against Philip. It has no inscription, but is
surmounted by a lion, probably a reference to the spirit of the men.
That there is no inscription is, in my opinion, because their courage
was not favored by appropriate good fortune.

Of all the gods
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\], the people of

the scepter \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skḗptron</span>\]
that Homer \[<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> 2.100–109\]
says[^597] was made by Hephaistos; this scepter was received from Zeus
by Hermes, who gave it to Pelops, and Pelops left it as an heirloom to
Atreus, while Atreus left it to Thyestes, and then Agamemnon held it,
taking it from Thyestes. So, they \[= the people of Khairōneia\] worship
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sebein</span>\] this scepter
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skḗptron</span>\]. The name
they give it is <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Dóru</span>
\[‘wooden staff’\]. And the fact that this object is quite-divine
\[*theióteron*\] is made most clear by its fame throughout humankind.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.40.12">

They \[= the people of Khairōneia\] say that it was found in the
mountains shared by them and the people of Panopeus, who are in Phokis.
And, together with the scepter, there was also gold that was found \[and
kept\] by these people of Phokis \[= the people of Panopeus in Phokis\],
while they \[= the people of Khairōneia in Boeotia\] gladly kept not the
gold but the scepter
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">skḗptron</span>\] instead. And
it \[= the gold\] was taken-to-safety
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">komizesthai</span>\] to Phokis
by Electra. daughter of Agamemnon, according to a version that I credit.
There is no temple
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nāós</span>\] that has been
built for it \[= the scepter in Khairōneia\] at public expense. Rather,
every year, someone who is sanctified-as-a-priest

keep in his household
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikēma</span>\] the scepter

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.41.1">

Poets have sung, and the tradition of men has followed them, that
Hephaistos made many works of art, but none is authentic except only the
scepter of Agamemnon. However, the Lycians in Patara show a bronze bowl
in their temple of Apollo, saying that Telephus dedicated it and
Hephaistos made it, apparently in ignorance of the fact that the first
to melt bronze were the Samians Theodoros and Rhoecus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.41.2">

The Achaeans of Patrai assert indeed that Hephaistos made the chest
brought by Eurypylos from Troy, but they do not actually exhibit it to
view. In Cyprus is a city Amathus, in which is an old sanctuary of
Adonis and Aphrodite. Here they say is dedicated a necklace given
originally to Harmonia, but called the necklace of Eriphyle, because it
was the bribe she took to betray her husband. It was dedicated at Delphi
by the sons of Phegeus (how they got it I have already related in my
history of Arcadia),[^598] but it was carried off by the tyrants of
Phokis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.41.3">

However, I do not think that it is in the sanctuary of Adonis at
Amathus. For the necklace at Amathus is composed of green stones held
together by gold, but the necklace given to Eriphyle was made entirely
of gold, according to Homer, who says in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“Who received precious gold, the price of her own husband.”

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 11.327

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Not that Homer was unaware of necklaces made of various materials.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.41.4">

For example, in the speech of Eumaios to Odysseus before Telemachus
reaches the court from Pylos, he says:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“There came a cunning man to the home of my father,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

With a necklace of gold strung with amber in between.”

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 15.459

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.41.5">

Again, in the passage called the gifts of Penelope, for he represents
the wooers, Eurymakhos among them, offering her gifts, he says:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

“And Eurymakhos straightway brought a necklace of varied materials,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Of gold strung with pieces of amber, like the sun.”

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 18.295

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

But Homer does not say that the necklace given to Eriphyle was of gold
varied with stones. So probably the scepter is the only work of
Hephaistos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:9.41.6">

There is beyond the city a crag called Petrachus. Here they hold that
Kronos was deceived, and received from Rhea a stone instead of Zeus, and
there is a small image of Zeus on the summit of the mountain.

Here in Khaironeia they distill unguents from flowers, namely, the lily,
the rose, the narcissus and the iris. These prove to be cures for the
pains of men. The unguent from the rose, if it be smeared on wooden
images, prevents their decaying. The iris grows in marshes, is in size
as large as a lily, but is not white in color, and smells less sweet.

## Scroll X. Phokis, Ozolian Lokris

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.1">

Evidently, the part of Phokis that surrounds Tithorea and Delphi was
named that way, from the earliest times onweard, after a Corinthian man,
Phokos son of Ornytion. Not many years afterwards, the name was given to
the entire region of what is today called Phokis. It happened when
people from Aegina sailed over to this region in their ships ships,
accompanied by Phokos, the son of Aiakos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.2">

So, the territory facing the Peloponnesus and pointing toward Boeotia is
occupied by the Phocians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Phōkeîs</span>\], that is, the
people of Phokis.This territory stretches to the seaand makes contact
with it on one side at Cirrha, the port of Delphi, and on the other side
at the city of Antikyra. In the direction of the Lamian Gulf, there is a
population that prevents the people of Phokis from being coastal
dwellers: this population, situated between Phokis and the sea, are the
people who are named Lokroi Hypoknēmidioi \[= people of Lokris who dwell
in the foothills\]. By these people is the boundary of Phokis defined in
this direction, by the people of Skarpheia on the other side of Elateia,
and by Opous and its port Kūnos beyond Hyampolis and Abai.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.3">

The most renowned deeds of the people of Phokis were achieved by them
all in unison \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en
koinōi</span>\]. They took part in the Trojan war, and fought against
the Thessalians before the Persian invasion of Greece, when they
accomplished
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-deiknunai</span>\] deeds
destined for remembrance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēmē</span>\].

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">PHOKIS, HISTORY</span>

Expecting that the Thessalians would invade their land at Hyampolis,
they buried there earthen water-jars
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hudriai</span>\], covered
these with earth, and so waited for the Thessalian cavalry. Ignorant of
the stratagem of the men of Phokis, the Thessalians without knowing it
drove their horses on to the water-jars
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hudriai</span>\], where
stumbling into them the horses were lamed and threw or killed their
riders.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.4">

The Thessalians, more enraged than ever against the people of Phokis,
gathered recruits from all their cities and marched out against them.
Whereupon the people of Phokis, rather terrified by the army of the
Thessalians, especially by the number of their cavalry and by the
disciplined training of both the horses and their riders, dispatched a
mission to Delphi, asking the god how they might escape the danger that
threatened them. And the oracular utterance
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteuma</span>\] that came
back to them \[from the Oracle\] was this:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

I will set mortal and immortal against each other in battle,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And to both will I give victory, but more to the mortal.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.5">

On receiving this oracle, the people of Phokis sent three hundred picked
men with Gelon in command to make an attack on the enemy. The night was
just falling, and the orders given were to reconnoiter without being
observed, to return to the main body by the least known route, and to
remain strictly on the defensive. These picked men along with their
leader, Gelon, were trampled by the horses and butchered by their
enemies. So they all perished at the hands of the Thessalians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.6">

Their disaster created such panic among the people of Phokis in the camp
that they actually gathered together in one spot their women, children,
movable property, and also their clothes, gold, silver, and images of
the gods, and making a vast pyre, they left in charge a force of thirty
men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.7">

They were under orders that, if the men of Phokis should happen to be
defeated in the battle, they they would first put to death the women and
the children, then to put them on the pyre like
animal-victims-of-sacrifice
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hiereia</span>\] along with
the valuables, and finally to set the pyre on fire and perish
themselves, either by each other’s hands or by charging the cavalry of
the Thessalians. That is why the Greeks refer to any kind of plans
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">bouleumata</span>\] that are
unfeeling-of-pain
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">an-algē-ta</span>\] as ‘the
despair \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apo-noia</span>\] of
the people of Phokis’. At this point the men of Phokis set out to attack
the Thessalians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.8">

The commander of their cavalry was Daiphantes of Hyampolis, of their
infantry, Rhoios of Ambrossos. But the position of supreme commandwas
held by Tellias, a seer
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mantis</span>\] of Elis, in
whom the people of Phokis invested all their hopes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">elpides</span>\] for salvation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sōtēriā</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.9">

When the opposing forces reached the point of hand-to-hand combat, the
men of Phokis had before their eyes what they had resolved to do to
their women and children, and seeing that their own salvation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sōtēriā</span>\] was tottering
in the balance, they dared the most desperate deeds, and, with the good
will \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò eu-menes</span>\] of
the gods \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theoi</span>\], they
achieved the most famous victory of that era.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.10">

Then did all Greece understand the oracular-pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logion</span>\] given to the
people of Phokis by Apollo. For the watchword
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">sun-thēma</span>\] given by
the Thessalian generals in each situation of the battle was ‘Athena
Itōniā’, and by the generals of the people of Phokis, the watchword was
‘Phokos’, after whom the people of Phokis were named. Because of this
engagement, the people of Phokis sent as offerings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\] to Delphi
statues of Apollo, of Tellias the seer, and of all their other generals
in the battle, together with the heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\] of the local
population
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\]. The
images \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] were
the work of the Argive, Aristomedon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.1.11">

After this, the men of Phokis came up with a stratagem quite as clever
as their former ones. When the two armies were encamped opposite each
other at the pass into Phokis, five hundred picked men of Phokis,
waiting until the moon was full, attacked the Thessalians on that night,
first smearing themselves with gypsum
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gupsos</span>\] and, in
addition to the gypsum
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gupsos</span>\], putting on
white armor \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">leuka</span>\]. It
is said that there then occurred a wholesale slaughter of the
Thessalians, who thought this apparition of the night to be too
superhuman \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theion</span>\] to
be an attack of their enemies. It was Tellias of Elis who devised this
stratagem as well for the men of Phokis to use against the Thessalians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.2.1">

When the forces of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] crossed into
Europe \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Eurōpē</span>\], it is
said that the men of Phokis were forced to join the Great King but
defected from the side of the Medes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Mēdoi</span>\] and went over
to the Greek side \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò
Hellēnikon</span>\] on the occasion of the great deed-of-victory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] at \[the battle
at\] Plataea. Subsequently, it happened that a fine was imposed on them
by the Amphiktyones. I cannot find out the truth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">tò alēthes</span>\] of the
story \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logos</span>\], whether
the fine was imposed because of some misdeeds
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">adikēmata</span>\] committed
the people of Phokis, or whether the Thessalians imposed the fine on the
people of Phokis because of their ancient hatred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mīsos</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.2.2">

Since they were disheartened at the greatness of the fine, Philomēlos,
son of Theotīmos, than whom not one of the men of Phokis stood higher in
rank, his country being Ledon, a city of Phokis, took charge and tried
to persuade them to seize the sanctuary at Delphi, pointing out that the
amount of the sum to be paid was beyond their resources. He stated,
among other plausible arguments, that Athens and Sparta had always been
favorable to them, and that if Thebes or any other state made war
against them, they would have the better owing to their courage and
resources.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.2.3">

When Philomēlos put all this before them, the men of Phokis were not
unwilling, either because their judgment was blinded by the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\], or because
their nature was to put gain before reverence-for-what-is-sacred
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eu-sebeia</span>\]. The
seizure of Delphi by the men of Phokis occurred when Hērakleidēs was
president \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prutanis</span>\] at
Delphi and Agathokles was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the fourth year of the hundred and fifth Olympiad, when Prōros of Cyrene
was victorious in the foot-race.[^599]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.2.4">

When they \[= the men of Phokis\] had seized the sanctuary
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\], the best
mercenaries \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">xenika</span>\] in
Greece right away gathered to join them, while the Thebans, who were
already feeling hostile, declared open war against them. The war lasted
ten successive years, and during this long time, victory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nīkân</span>\] often went to
the men of Phokis and their mercenaries, but often the Thebans
came-out-on-top
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krateîn</span>\]. But then, in
a battle thattook place at the city of Neōn, the men of Phokis were
routed, and, as he was fleeing, Philomēlos threw himself down a high
precipice, and so lost his life
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">psūkhē</span>\]. This was
exactly the form of punishment
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dikē</span>\] set by the
Amphiktyones for those who plundered \[the sanctuary of Delphi\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.2.5">

After the death of Philomēlos, the men of Phokis gave the command to
Onomarkhos, while Philip, son of Amyntas, made an alliance with the
Thebans. In the battle that took place, Philipcame out on top
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">krateîn</span>\], and, when
Onomarkhos fled to the coast, his own men killed him by throwing their
javelins at him. They blamed their defeat on his lack of boldness and on
his inexperience as a general.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.2.6">

Such was the outcome
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">telos</span>\] that the
superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] brought upon
Onomarkhos, and his brother Phaülos was chosen as commander-in-chief. It
is said that no sooner had this Phaülos attained rulership
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhē</span>\] over the people
of Phokis when he saw the following vision in a dream. Among the votive
offerings \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\]
to Apollo was a representation
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mīmēma</span>\] in bronze of a
man’s body in an advanced stage of decay, with the flesh already fallen
off, and nothing left but the bones. The Delphians said that it was an
offering \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēma</span>\] of
Hippokrates the physician. Now the thought came to Phaülos that he
resembled this offering
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\]. Right
away he was attacked by a wasting disease, which thus brought to
fulfillment
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epi-teleîn</span>\] the
prophecy \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteiā</span>\] of
the dream.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.2.7">

On the death of Phaylus, the sovereignty of the people of Phokis
devolved on Phalaikos, his son. Phalaikos, accused of appropriating to
his own use the sacred treasures, was deposed, and crossing with a fleet
to Crete, accompanied by those men from Phokis who sided with him and by
a part of his mercenaries, he sat down to besiege Kydonia, which refused
to accede to his demand for money, and perished along with the greater
part of his army.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.3.1">

In the tenth year after the seizure of the sanctuary, Philip put an end
to the war, which was called both the War of Phokis and the Sacred War,
in the year when Theophilus was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens,
which was the first of the hundred and eighth Olympiad at which Polykles
of Cyrene was victorious in the foot-race.[^600] The cities of Phokis
were captured and razed to the ground. The tale of them was Lilaia,
Hyampolis, Antikyra, Parapotamii, Panopeus, and Daulis. These cities
were distinguished in days of old, especially because of the poetry of
Homer.[^601]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.3.2">

The army of Xerxes, burning down certain of these, made them better
known in Greece, namely Erochus, Kharadra, Amphicleia, Neon, Tithronium,
and Drymaia. The rest of the cities of Phokis, except Elateia, were not
famous in former times, I mean Trakhis-in-Phokis, Medeon-in-Phokis,
Ekhedameia, Ambrossos, Ledon, Phlygonion, and Stiris. On the occasion to
which I have referred, all the cities enumerated were razed to the
ground and their people scattered in villages. The one exception to this
treatment was Abai, whose citizens were free from impiety, and had no
share in the seizure of the sanctuary or in the war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.3.3">

The people of Phokis were deprived of their share in the Delphic
sanctuary and in the Greek assembly, and their votes were given by the
Amphiktyones to the Macedonians. Subsequently, however, the cities of
Phokis were rebuilt, and their inhabitants restored from the villages to
their native cities, save such as were prevented from being rebuilt by
their original weakness and by their want of funds at the period of
restoration. It was the Athenians and Thebans who brought back the
inhabitants before the disaster of Khaironeia befell the Greeks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.3.4">

The people of Phokis took part in the battle of Khaironeia, and
afterwards fought at Lamia and Crannon against the Macedonians under
Antipatros. No Greeks were keener defenders against the Gauls and the
Celtic invaders than were the men of Phokis, who considered that they
were helping the god of Delphi, and at the same time, I take it, that
they were making amends for the old crimes they had committed.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">PANOPEUS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.1">

Such were the memorable exploits of the men of Phokis. From Khaironeia,
it is twenty stadium-lengths to Panopeus, a city of the people of
Phokis, if one can give the name of city to those who possess no
government offices, no gymnasium, no theater, no marketplace, no water
descending to a fountain, but live in bare shelters just like mountain
cabins, right on a ravine. Nevertheless, they have boundaries with their
neighbors and even send delegates to the assembly of Phokis. The name of
the city is derived, they say, from the father of Epeios, and they
maintain that they are not people of Phokis but were originally
Phlegyans who fled to Phokis from the land of Orkhomenos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.2">

A survey of the ancient circuit of Panopeus led me to guess it to be
about seven stadium-lengths. I was reminded of Homer’s verses about
Tityos,[^602] where he mentions the city of Panopeus with its beautiful
dancing floors, and how in the fight over the body of Patroklos, he says
that Schedios, son of Iphitos and king of the people of Phokis, who was
killed by Hector, lived in Panopeus.[^603] It seemed to me that the
reason why the king lived here was fear of the Boeotians; at this point
is the easiest pass from Boeotia into Phokis, so the king used Panopeus
as a fortified post.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.3">

The former passage, in which Homer speaks of the beautiful dancing
floors of Panopeus, I could not understand until I was taught by the
women whom the Athenians call Thyiads. The Thyiads are Attic women, who
with the Delphian women go to Parnassus every other year and celebrate
orgies in honor of Dionysus. It is the custom for these Thyiads to hold
dances at places, including Panopeus, along the road from Athens. The
epithet Homer applies to Panopeus is thought to refer to the dance of
the Thyiads.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.4">

At Panopeus, there is by the roadside a small building of unburned
brick, in which is an image of Pentelic marble, said by some to be
Asklepios, by others, Prometheus. The latter produce evidence of their
contention. At the ravine, there lie two stones, each of which is big
enough to fill a cart. They have the color of clay, not earthy clay, but
such as would be found in a ravine or sandy torrent, and they smell very
like the skin of a man. They say that these are remains of the clay out
of which the whole lineage of humankind was fashioned by Prometheus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.5">

Here at the ravine is the tomb of Tityos. The circumference of the mound
is just about one-third of a stadium-length, and they say that the verse
in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Lying on the ground, and he lay over nine roods,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 11.577

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

refers, not to the size of Tityos, but to the place where he lay, the
name of which was Nine Roods.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.6">

Kleon of Magnesia-on-the-Hermos used to say that those men were
incredulous of wonders who in the course of their own lives had not met
yet greater marvels. He declared that Tityos and other monsters had been
as tradition says they were. He happened, he said, to be at Cadiz, and
he, with the rest of the crowd, sailed forth from the island in
accordance with the command of Hēraklēs;[^604] on their return to Cadiz,
they found cast ashore a man of the sea, who was about five roods in
size and burning away, because he was blasted with a thunderbolt sent by
the god \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\].

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">DAULIS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.7">

So said Kleon. About twenty-seven stadium-lengths distant from Panopeus
is Daulis. The men there are few in number, but for size and strength,
no men of Phokis are more renowned even to this day. They say that the
name of the city is derived from Daulis, a nymph, the daughter of the
Kephisos. Others say that the place, on which the city was built, was
wooded, and that such shaggy places
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dasea</span>\] were called
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daula</span> by the ancients.
For this reason, they say, Aeschylus called the beard of Glaukos of
Anthedon <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hypene daulos</span>.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.8">

Here in Daulis the women are said to have served up to Tereus his own
son, which act was the first pollution of the dining table among men.
The hoopoe, into which they say Tereus was changed, is a bird a little
larger than the quail, while the feathers on its head rise into the
shape of a crest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.9">

It is noteworthy that in Phokis swallows neither hatch nor lay eggs; in
fact, no swallow would even make a nest in the roof of a house. The
people of Phokis say that even when Philomela was a bird, she had a
terror of Tereus and so kept away from his country. At Daulis is a
sanctuary of Athena with an ancient image. The wooden image, of an even
earlier date, the Daulians say was brought from Athens by Procne.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">NEAR DAULIS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.4.10">

In the territory of Daulis is a place called Tronis. Here has been built
a shrine of the founder hero. This founder is said by some to have been
Xanthippos, a distinguished soldier; others say that he was Phokos, son
of Ornytion, son of Sisyphus. At any rate, he is worshipped every day,
and the people of Phokis bring victims and pour the blood into the tomb
through a hole, but the flesh they are accustomed to consume on the
spot.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.1">

There is also an ascent through Daulis to the summit of Parnassus, a
longer one than that from Delphi, though not so difficult. Turning back
from Daulis to the straight road to Delphi and going forwards, you see
on the left of the road a building called the Phocian Building of the
People of Phokis, where assemble the delegates from each city of Phokis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.2">

The building is large, and within are pillars standing throughout its
length. From the pillars rise steps to each wall, on which steps the
delegates of Phokis take their seats. At the end are neither pillars nor
steps, but images of Zeus, Athena, and Hērā. That of Zeus is on a
throne; on his right stands Hērā, on his left, Athena.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">THE CLEFT ROAD</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.3">

Going forward from here, you will come to a road called the Cleft Road,
the very road on which Oedipus slew his father. Fate would have it that
memorials of the sufferings of Oedipus should be left throughout the
length and width of Greece. At his birth, they pieced his ankles with
goads and exposed him on Mount Kithairon in Plataean territory.[^605]
Corinth and the land at the Isthmus were the scenes of his upbringing.
Phokis and the Cleft Road received the pollution of his murdered
father’s blood. Thebes is even more notorious for the marriage of
Oedipus and for the sin of Eteokles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.4">

The Cleft Road and the rash deed committed on it by Oedipus were the
beginning of his troubles, and the tombs of Laios and the servant who
followed him are still just as they were in the very middle of the place
where the three roads meet, and over them have been piled unhewn stones.
According to the story, it was Damasistratos, king of Plataea, who found
the bodies lying and buried them.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">DELPHI, MYTHICAL HISTORY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.5">

From here, the high road to Delphi becomes both steeper and more
difficult for the walker. Many and different are the stories told about
Delphi, and even more so about the oracle of Apollo. For they say that
in the earliest times, the oracular seat belonged to Earth, who
appointed as prophetess at it Daphnis, one of the nymphs of the
mountain.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.6">

There is extant among the Greeks an hexameter poem, the name of which is
Eumolpia, and it is assigned to Musaeus, son of Antiophemus. In it, the
poet states that the oracle belonged to Poseidon and Earth in common;
that Earth gave her oracles herself, but Poseidon used Pyrcon as his
mouthpiece in giving responses. The verses are these:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Forthwith the voice of the Earth goddess uttered a wise word,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And with her Pyrcon, servant of the renowned Earth-shaker.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

\[Musaeus,\] <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Eumolpia</span>

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

They say that afterwards Earth gave her share to Themis, who gave it to
Apollo as a gift. It is said that he gave to Poseidon Kalaureia, that
lies off Troizen, in exchange for his oracle.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.7">

I have heard too that shepherds feeding their flocks came upon the
oracle, were inspired by the vapor, and prophesied as the mouthpiece of
Apollo. The most prevalent view, however, is that Phemonoe was the first
prophetess of the god, and first sang in hexameter verse. Boeo, a native
woman who composed a hymn for the Delphians, said that the oracle was
established for the god by comers from the Hyperboreans, Olen, and
others and that he was the first to prophesy and the first to chant the
hexameter oracles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.8">

The verses of Boeo are:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Here in truth, a mindful oracle was built

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

By the sons of the Hyperboreans, Pagasus, and divine Agyieus.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Boeo, work unknown

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

After enumerating others also of the Hyperboreans, at the end of the
hymn she names Olen:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And Olen, who became the first prophet of Phoebus,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And first fashioned a song of ancient verses.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Boeo, work unknown

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

Tradition, however, reports no other man as prophet but makes mention of
prophetesses only.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.9">

They say that the most ancient temple of Apollo was made of laurel, the
branches of which were brought from the laurel in Tempe. This temple
must have had the form of a hut. The Delphians say that the second
temple was made by bees from bees’ wax and feathers and that it was sent
to the Hyperboreans by Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.10">

Another story is current, that the temple was set up by a Delphian,
whose name was Pteras, and so the temple received its name from the
builder. After this, Pteras, so they say, the city in Crete was named,
with the addition of a letter, Apterei. The story that the temple was
built of the fern
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pteris</span>\] that grows on
the mountains, by interweaving fresh stalks of it, I do not accept at
all.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.11">

It is no wonder that the third temple was made of bronze, seeing that
Akrisios made a bedchamber of bronze for his daughter, the
Lacedaemonians still possess a sanctuary of Athena of the Bronze House,
and the Roman forum, a marvel for its size and style, possesses a roof
of bronze. So it would not be unlikely that a temple of bronze was made
for Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.12">

The rest of the story I cannot believe, either that the temple was the
work of Hephaistos, or what they say about the golden singers, referred
to by Pindar in his verses about this bronze temple:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Above the pediment sang Golden Charmers.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Pindar, work unknown

These words, it seems to me, are but an imitation of Homer’s[^606]
account of the Sirens. Neither did I find the accounts agree of the way
this temple disappeared. Some say that it fell into a chasm in the
earth, others that it was melted by fire.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.5.13">

The fourth temple was made by Trophonios and Agamedes; the tradition is
that it was made of stone. It was burned down in the year when
Erxikleides was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the first year of the fifty-eighth Olympiad, when Diognetos of Kroton
was victorious.[^607] The modern temple was built for the god by the
Amphiktyones from the sacred treasures, and the architect was one
Spintharus of Corinth.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.6.1">

They say that the oldest city was founded here by Parnassus, a son of
Kleodora, a nymph. Like the other heroes, as they are called, he had two
fathers; one, they say, was the god Poseidon, the human father being
Kleopompos. After this, Parnassus was named, they say, both the mountain
and also the Parnassian glen. Augury from flying birds was, it is said,
a discovery of Parnassus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.6.2">

Now this city, so the story goes on, was flooded by the rains that fell
in the time of Deukalion. Such of the inhabitants as were able to escape
the storm were led by the howls of wolves to safety on the top of
Parnassus, being led on their way by these beasts, and on this account,
they called the city that they founded Lykoreia \[wolf-mountain\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.6.3">

Another and different story is current that Apollo had a son Lykoros by
a nymph, Corycia, and that after Lykoros was named the city Lykoreia,
and after the nymph, the Corycian cave. It is also said that Kelaino was
daughter to Hyamos, son of Lykoros, and that Delphos, from whom comes
the present name of the city, was a son of Kelaino, daughter of Hyamos,
by Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.6.4">

Others maintain that Kastalios, an aborigine, had a daughter Thyia, who
was the first to be priestess of Dionysus and celebrated orgies in honor
of the god. It is said that later on, men called after her Thyiads all
women who rave in honor of Dionysus. At any rate, they hold that Delphus
was a son of Apollo and Thyia. Others say that his mother was Melaina,
daughter of Kephisos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.6.5">

Afterwards, the dwellers around called the city Pythō, as well as
Delphi, just as Homer[^608] so calls it in the list of the men of
Phokis. Those who would find pedigrees for everything think that Pythes
was a son of Delphus and that because he was king, the city was called
Pythō. But the most widespread tradition has it that the victim of
Apollo’s arrows rotted here and that this was the reason why the city
received the name Pythō. For the men of those days used
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">puthesthai</span> for the verb
‘to rot’, and hence, Homer in his poem says that the island of the
Sirens was full of bones, because the men who heard their singing rotted
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eputhonto</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.6.6">

The poets say that the victim of Apollo was a dragon posted by Earth to
be a guard for the oracle. It is also said that he was a violent son of
Krios, a man with authority around Euboea. He pillaged the sanctuary of
the god, and he also pillaged the houses of rich men. But when he was
making a second expedition, the Delphians besought Apollo to keep from
them the danger that threatened them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.6.7">

Phemonoe, the prophetess of that day, gave them an oracle in hexameter
verse:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

At close quarters, a grievous arrow shall Apollo shoot

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

At the spoiler of Parnassus; and of his blood guilt

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The Cretans shall purify his hands; but the renown shall never die.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.1">

It seems that from the beginning, the sanctuary at Delphi has been
plotted against by a vast number of men. Attacks were made against it by
this Euboean pirate, and years afterwards by the Phlegyan nation;
furthermore, by Pyrrhos, son of Achilles, by a portion of the army of
Xerxes, by the chieftains of Phokis, whose attacks on the wealth of the
god were the longest and fiercest, and by the Gallic invaders. It was
fated too that Delphi was to suffer from the universal irreverence of
Nero, who robbed Apollo of five hundred bronze statues, some of gods,
some of men.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">PYTHIAN GAMES, MYTHICAL
HISTORY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.2">

The oldest contest and the one for which they first offered prizes was,
according to traditional memory, the singing of a hymn to the god. The
man who sang and won the prize was Khrysothemis of Crete, whose father
Carmanor is said to have purified Apollo. After Khrysothemis, according
to traditional memory, Philammon won with a song, and after him, his son
Thamyris. But they say that Orpheus, a proud man and conceited about his
mysteries, and Musaeus, who copied Orpheus in everything, refused to
submit to the competition in musical skill.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.3">

They say too that Eleuther won a Pythian victory for his loud and sweet
voice, for the song that he sang was not of his own composition. The
story is that Hesiod too was debarred from competing because he had not
learned to accompany his own singing on the harp. Homer too came to
Delphi to inquire about his needs, but even though he had learned to
play the harp, he would have found the skill useless, owing to the loss
of his eyesight.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">PYTHIAN GAMES, HISTORY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.4">

In the third year of the forty-eighth Olympiad,[^609] at which Glaukias
of Kroton was victorious, the Amphiktyones held contests for harping as
from the beginning but added competitions for
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> playing and for
singing to the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>. The
conquerors proclaimed were Melampos, a Cephallenian, for harping, and
Ekhembrotos, an Arcadian, for singing to the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\],
with Sacadas of Argos for
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> playing. This same
Sacadas won victories at the next two Pythian festivals.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.5">

On that occasion, they also offered for the first time prizes for
athletes, the competitions being the same as those at Olympia, except
the four horse chariot, and the Delphians themselves added to the
contests running races for boys, the long course, and the double course.
At the second Pythian Festival, they no longer offered prizes for events
and hereafter gave a garland for victory. On this occasion, they no
longer included singing to the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\],
thinking that the music was ill-omened to listen to. For the tunes of
the <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>
\[‘double-reed’\] were most dismal, and the words sung to the tunes were
lamentations.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.6">

What I say is confirmed by the votive offering of Ekhembrotos, a bronze
tripod dedicated to the Hēraklēs at Thebes. The tripod has as its
inscription:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Ekhembrotos of Arcadia dedicated this pleasant gift to Hēraklēs

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When he won a victory at the Games of the Amphiktyones,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Singing for the Greeks tunes and lamentations.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

In this way the competition in singing to the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\]
was dropped. But they added a chariot race, and Cleisthenes, the tyrant
of Sikyon, was proclaimed victor in the chariot race.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.7">

At the eighth Pythian Festival, they added a contest for harpists
playing without singing; Agelaos of Tegea was garlanded. At the
twenty-third Pythian Festival, they added a race in armor. For this,
Timainetos of Phleious won the laurel, five Olympiads after Damaretos of
Heraia was victorious. At the forty-eighth Pythian Festival, they
established a race for two horse chariots, and the chariot that won
belonged to Exekestides of Phokis. At the fifth Festival after this,
they yoked foals to a chariot, and the chariot of Orphondas of Thebes
came in first.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.7.8">

The pankration for boys, a race for a chariot drawn by two foals, and a
race for ridden foals, were many years afterwards introduced from Elis.
The first was brought in at the sixty-first Pythian Festival, and
Iolaidas of Thebes was victorious. At the next Festival but one, they
held a race for a ridden foal, and at the sixty-ninth Festival, a race
for a chariot drawn by two foals;[^610] the victor proclaimed for the
former was Lykormas of Larisa, for the latter, Ptolemy the Macedonian.
For the kings of Egypt liked to be called Macedonians, as in fact they
were.

</div>

The reason why a garland of laurel is the prize for a Pythian victory
is, in my opinion, simply and solely because the prevailing tradition
has it that Apollo fell in love with the daughter of Ladon.

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">AMPHITYONIC LEAGUE, MYTHICAL
HISTORY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.1">

Some are of opinion that the assembly of the Greeks that meets at Delphi
was established by Amphiktyon, the son of Deukalion, and that the
delegates were styled Amphiktyones after him. But Androtion, in his
history of Attica, says that originally the councillors came to Delphi
from the neighboring states, that the deputies were styled Amphictions
(neighbors), but that as time went on, their modern name prevailed.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.2">

They say that Amphiktyon himself summoned to the common assembly the
following lineages
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gen</span><span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ē</span>\]of
the Greek people:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

Ionians, Dolopes, Thessalians, Ainianes, Magnesians, Malians, Phthiōtai,
Dorians, people of Phokis, people of Lokris who border on Phokis, living
at the base of Mount Knemis.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">AMPHIKTYONIC LEAGUE, HISTORY</span>

But when the men of Phokis seized the sanctuary and the war came to an
end nine years afterwards, there came a change in the Amphiktyonic
League. The Macedonians managed to enter it, while the people of Phokis
and a section of the Dorians, namely the Lacedaemonians, lost their
membership, the people of Phokis because of their rash crime, the
Lacedaemonians as a penalty for allying themselves with the men of
Phokis.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.3">

When Brennus led the Gallic army against Delphi, no Greeks showed
greater zeal for the war than the men of Phokis, and for this conduct of
theirs, recovered their membership of the League, as well as their old
reputation. The emperor Augustus willed that the people of Nikopolis,
whose city is near Actium, should be members of the Amphiktyonic League,
that the Magnesians moreover and the Malians, together with the Aenianes
and Phthiōtai, should be numbered with the Thessalians, and that all
their votes, together with those of the Dolopes, who were no longer a
separate people, should be assigned to the people of Nikopolis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.4">

The Amphiktyones today number thirty. Nikopolis, Macedonia, and Thessaly
each send six deputies; the Boeotians, who in more ancient days
inhabited Thessaly and were then called Aeolians, the people of Phokis
and the Delphians, each send two; ancient Doris sends one.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.5">

The people of Lokris who are called Ozolian and the people of Lokris
opposite Euboea send one each; there is also one from Euboea. Of the
Peloponnesians, the Argives, Sikyonians, Corinthians, and Megarians send
one, as Nikopolis send deputies to every meeting of the Amphiktyonic
League; but each city of the nations mentioned has the privilege of
sending members in turn after the lapse of periodic intervals.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">DELPHI</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.6">

When you enter the city, you see temples in a row. The first of them was
in ruins, and the one next to it had neither images nor statues. The
third had statues of a few Roman emperors; the fourth is called the
temple of Athena Forethought. Of its two images, the one in the fore
temple is a votive offering of the Massiliots and is larger than the one
inside the temple. The Massiliots are a colony of Phokaia in Ionia, and
their city was founded by some of those who ran away from Phokaia when
attacked by Harpagus the Persian. They proved superior to the
Carthaginians in a sea war, acquired the territory they now hold, and
reached great prosperity.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.7">

The votive offering of the Massiliots is of bronze. The gold shield
given to Athena Forethought by Croesus the Lydian was said by the
Delphians to have been stolen by Philomēlos. Near the sanctuary of
Forethought is a precinct of the hero Phylacus. This Phylacus is
reported by the Delphians to have defended them at the time of the
invasion of the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.8">

They say that in the open part of the gymnasium, there once grew a wild
wood, and that Odysseus, when as the guest of Autolykos he was hunting
with the sons of Autolycus, received here from the wild boar the wound
above the knee. Turning to the left from the gymnasium and going down
not more, I think, than three stadium-lengths, you come to a river named
Pleistos. This Pleistos descends to Cirrha, the port of Delphi, and
flows into the sea there.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.8.9">

Going up from the gymnasium along the way to the sacred space
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>\] \[of Apollo\]
you reach, on the right of the way, the water of Castalia \[Kastalia\],
which is sweet to drink and pleasant to bathe in. Some say that the
spring \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\] was named
after a native
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrios</span>\] woman,
others after a man called Castalius (Kastalios). But Panyassis son of
Polyarkhos, who composed epic verses
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epē</span>\] about Hēraklēs,
says that Castalia was a daughter of Akhelōos. So, about Hēraklēs he \[=
Panyassis\] says:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

I have heard another account, that the water was a gift to Castalia from
the river Kephisos. That is the way Alcaeus has it in his prelude
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">prooimion</span>\] to Apollo.
There is confirmation from the Lilaeans, who, on certain specified days,
have the custom
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">nomizein</span>\] of throwing
into the spring of the river Kephisos cakes of-the-district

He won no victory at Olympia, but his victories at Pythō \[= Delphi\]

Such is the story of the athlete of Kroton. On entering the enclosure,
you come to a bronze bull, a votive offering of the Corcyraeans made by
proposTheopropos of Aegina. The story is that in Corcyra, a bull,
leaving the cows, would go down from the pasture and bellow on the
shore. As the same thing happened every day, the herdsman went down to
the sea and saw a countless number of tunas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.9.4">

He reported the matter to the Corcyraeans, who, finding their labor lost

they sacrificed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thuein</span>\] the bull to

The Athenians refuse to admit that their defeat at Aigospotamoi was
fairly inflicted, maintaining that they were betrayed by Tydeus and
Adeimantos, their generals, who had been bribed, they say, with money by
Lysander. As a proof of this assertion, they quote the following oracle
of the Sibyl \[Sibulla\]:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

So much for this. The struggle for the district called Thyreā[^614]
between the Lacedaemonians and the Argives[^615] was also foretold by
the Sibyl \[Sibulla\], who said that the battle would be end in a draw.
But the Argives claimed that they had the better of the engagement and
sent to Delphi a bronze horse, supposed to be the wooden horse of Troy.
It is the work of Antiphanes of Argos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.10.1">

On the base below the wooden horse is an inscription saying that the
images \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] were
dedicated from a tithe of the spoils taken in the great deed
\[<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">ergon</span>\] \[of the battle\] at
Marathon. They are Athena, Apollo, and Miltiades, one of the generals.
Of those called heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\] there are
Erekhtheus; Kekrops; Pandion; Leōs; Antiokhosson of Hēraklēs by Mēdā
daughter of Phylas; also Aigeus; and Akamas, one of the sons of Theseus.
These \[heroes\] gave names, in compliance with an oracular
pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteuma</span>\] from Delphi,
to “tribes” \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phūlai</span>\] in
Athens. Kodros, however, the son of Melanthos, also Theseus also Neleus,
these are not givers-of-names
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ep-ōnumoi</span>\] to “tribes”
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phūlai</span>\].

The statues enumerated were made by Pheidias, and really are a tithe of
the spoils of the battle. But the statues of Antigonos, of his son
Demetrios, and of Ptolemy the Egyptian, were sent to Delphi by the
Athenians afterwards. The statue of the Egyptian they sent out of good
will \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eunoiā</span>\]; those of
the Macedonians were sent out of dread
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">deos</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.10.3">

Near the horse are also other votive offerings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anathēmata</span>\] from the
Argives.There are the leaders of those who with Polyneikes made war on
Thebes: Adrastos the son of Talaos; Tydeus son of Oineus; the
descendants of Proitos, namely, Kapaneus son of Hipponoos and Eteoklos
son of Iphis; Polyneikes; and Hippomedon, son of the sister of Adrastos.
Nearby has been made the chariot of Amphiaraos, and in it stands Baton,
who was charioteer of Amphiaraos and who had a relationship with
Amphiaraos in other ways as well. The last of them is Alitherses.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.10.4">

These are works of Hypatodoros and Aristogeiton, who made them, as the
Argives themselves say, from the spoils of the victory that they and
their Athenian allies won over the Lacedaemonians at Oinoe in Argive
territory.[^616] From spoils of the same deed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ergon</span>\] \[of victory\],
it seems to me, the Argives set-up-as-votive-offerings
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">anatithenai</span>\] statues
of those whom the Greeks call the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Epigonoi</span>. I say this
because there are set up
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">keisthai</span>\] images
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] of these
also: Sthenelos, Alkmaion, who I think was honored before Amphilokhos on
account of his age, Promakhos also, Thersandros, Aigialeus, and
Diomedes. Between Diomedes and Aigialeus is Euryalos.

Opposite them are other statues
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">andriantes</span>\], dedicated
by the Argives who participated with the Thebans led by Epameinondas to
found Messene. The statues are images
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">eikones</span>\] of heroes
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hērōes</span>\]: Danaos, the
most powerful king of Argos, and Hypermnestra, who alone of her sisters
kept her hands undefiled. By her side is Lynkeus also, and the whole

Perseus.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.10.6">

The bronze horses and captive women dedicated by the people of Tarentum
were made from spoils taken from the Messapians, a barbarian population
bordering on the territory of Tarentum, and are works of Ageladas the
Argive. Tarentum is a colony of the Lacedaemonians, and its founder was
Phalanthos, a Spartan. On setting out to found a colony, Phalanthos
received an oracular pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">logion</span>\] from Delphi,
declaring that when he feels rain under a cloudless sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aithrā</span>\], he will then
win both a territory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōrā</span>\] and a city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.10.7">

At first, he neither questioned the oracular pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">manteuma</span>\] himself nor
consulted any of his interpreters but came to Italy with his ships. But
when, although he won victories over the barbarians, he succeeded
neither in taking a city
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">polis</span>\] nor in making
himself master of a territory
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khōrā</span>\], he he arrived
at a recall
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ana-mnēsis</span>\] of the
oracular pronouncement
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">khrēsmos</span>\] and thought
that the god had foretold an impossibility. For never could rain fall
from a clear and cloudless sky. When he was in despair, his wife, who
had accompanied him from home, among other endearments placed her
husband’s head between her knees and began to pick out the lice. And it
chanced that the wife, such was her affection, wept as she saw her
husband’s fortunes coming to nothing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.10.8">

As her tears fell in showers, and she wetted the head of Phalanthus, he
realized the meaning of the oracle, for his wife’s name was Aithra. And
so on that night, he took from the barbarians Tarentum, the largest and
most prosperous city on the coast. They say that Taras the hero was a
son of Poseidon by a nymph of the country, and that after this hero were
named both the city and the river. For the river, just like the city, is
called Taras.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.11.1">

Near the votive offering of the the people of Tarentum is a treasury of
the Sikyonians, but there is no treasure to be seen either here or in
any other of the treasuries. The people of Knidos brought the following
images to Delphi: Triopas, founder of Knidos, standing by a horse, Leto,
and Apollo and Artemis shooting arrows at Tityos, who has already been
wounded in the body.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.11.2">

These stand by the treasury of the Sikyonians. The Siphnians too made a
treasury, the reason being as follows. Their island contained gold
mines, and the god ordered them to pay a tithe of the revenues to
Delphi. So they built the treasury and continued to pay the tithe until
greed made them omit the tribute, when the sea flooded their mines and
hid them from sight.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.11.3">

The people of Lipara too dedicated statues to commemorate a naval
victory over the Etruscans. These people were colonists from Knidos, and
the leader of the colony is said to have been a man from Knidos, whose
name was Pentathlus according to a statement made by the Syracusan
Antiokhos, son of Xenophanes, in his history of Sicily. He says also
that they built a city on Cape Pachynum in Sicily but were hard pressed
in a war with the Elymi and Phoenicians and driven out, but occupied the
islands, from which they expelled the inhabitants if they were not still
uninhabited, still called, as they are called by Homer,[^617] the
Islands of Aeolus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.11.4">

Of these islands, they dwell in Lipara, on which they built a city, but
Hiera, Strongyle, and Didymae, they cultivate, crossing to them in
ships. On Strongyle fire is to be seen rising out of the ground, while
in Hiera, fire of its own accord bursts out on the summit of the island,
and by the sea are baths, comfortable enough if the water receive you
kindly,[^618] but if not, painful to enter because of the heat.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.11.5">

The Thebans have a treasury built from the spoils of war, and so have
the Athenians. Whether the people of Knidos built to commemorate a
victory or to display their prosperity, I do not know, but the Theban
treasury was made from the spoils taken at the battle of Leuktra, and
the Athenian treasury, from those taken from the army that landed with
Datis at Marathon. The inhabitants of Kleonai were, like the Athenians,
afflicted with the plague, and obeying an oracle from Delphi, sacrificed
a he-goat to the sun while it was still rising. This put an end to the
trouble, and so they sent a bronze he-goat to Apollo. The Syracusans
have a treasury built from the spoils taken in the great Athenian
disaster; the Potidaeans in Thrace built one to show their piety to the
god.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.11.6">

The Athenians also built a portico out of the spoils they took in their
war against the Peloponnesians and their Greek allies. There are also
dedicated the figure heads of ships and bronze shields. The inscription
on them enumerates the cities from which the Athenians sent the first
fruits: Elis, Lacedaemon, Sikyon, Megara, Pellene in Achaea, Ambracia,
Leucas, and Corinth itself. It also says that from the spoils taken in
these sea battles, a sacrifice was offered to Theseus and to Poseidon at
the cape called Rhium. It seems to me that the inscription refers to
Phormion, son of Asopikhos, and to his achievements.[^619]

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">THE SIBYLS, MYTHICAL HISTORY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.12.1">

There is a rock \[along the Sacred Way of Delphi\] that sticks out of
the earth. On top of it, say the people of Delphi, there once stood,
singing <span custom-style="Emphasis">āidein</span> =
<span custom-style="Emphasis">aeidein</span>\] the oracular-sayings
\[<span custom-style="Emphasis">khrēsmoi</span>\], someone by the name
of Hērophilē. Her name-of-invocation
\[<span custom-style="Emphasis">epiklēsis</span>\] was Sibyl
\[<span custom-style="Emphasis">Síbulla</span>\]. \[In my
investigations\] I found an earlier one \[= an even earlier Sibyl\], as
ancient as any of the others. The Greeks \[Hellēnes\] say that she was a
daughter of Zeus and of Lamia, who in turn was a daughter of Poseidon,
and that she was the first woman to sing
\[<span custom-style="Emphasis">āidein</span> =
<span custom-style="Emphasis">aeidein</span>\] oracular-sayings
\[<span custom-style="Emphasis">khrēsmoi</span>\]. And they say that the
name Sibyl \[<span custom-style="Emphasis">Síbulla</span>\] was given
her by the Libyans.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.12.2">

Hērophilē was more recent than that one \[= the one I was just talking
about\], but, in any case, she too was early, early enough to predate,
evidently, the Trojan War, since she foretold in her oracular-sayings
\[<span custom-style="Emphasis">khrēsmoi</span>\] that Helen would be
born-and-raised \[<span custom-style="Emphasis">trephein</span> in the
passive\] in Sparta to become the ruin of Asia and of Europe and that
for her sake, the Greeks \[Hellēnes\] would capture Troy. The people of
Delos remember also a hymn
\[<span custom-style="chstranslitgreek">*humnos*</span>\] this woman
composed to Apollo.  \[In her composition,\] she calls herself not only
Hērophilē but also Artemis; further, in some contexts, she says that she
is a woman married to Apollo and, in other contexts, that she is his
sister and, in still other contexts, that she is his daughter.

Even today, there remain on Trojan \[Mount\] Ida the ruins of the city
Marpessos, with about sixty inhabitants. All the land around Marpessos
is somewhat red and terribly parched, so that the light and porous
nature of Ida in this place is, in my opinion, the reason why the river
Aidoneus sinks into the ground, rises to sink once more, finally
disappearing altogether beneath the earth. Marpessos is two hundred and
forty stadium-lengths distant from Alexandria-in-the-Troad.

A bronze head of the Paionian bull called the bison was sent to Delphi
by the Paionian king Dropion, son of Leon. These bisons are the most
difficult beasts to capture alive, and no nets could be made strong
enough to hold out against their rush. They are hunted in the following
manner. When the hunters have found a place sinking to a hollow, they
first strengthen it all round with a stout fence, and then, they cover

This is the way in which the bisons are caught. Opposite the bronze head
of the bison is a statue of a man wearing a breastplate, on which is a
cloak. The Delphians say that it is an offering of the Andrians, and a
portrait of Andreus, their founder. The images of Apollo, Athena, and
Artemis were dedicated by the people of Phokis from the spoils taken
from the Thessalians, their enemies always, who are their neighbors
except where the people of Lokris who are called Epiknemidioi come
between.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.13.5">

The Thessalians too of Pharsalus dedicated an Achilles on horseback,
with Patroklos running beside his horse: the Macedonians living in Dium,
a city at the foot of Mount Pieria, the Apollo who has taken hold of the
deer; the people of Cyrene, a Greek city in Libya, the chariot with an
image of Ammon in it. The Dorians of Corinth too built a treasury, where
used to be stored the gold from Lydia.[^621]

The image of Hēraklēs is a votive offering of the Thebans, sent when
they had fought what is called the Sacred War against the people of
Phokis. There are also bronze statues, which the people of Phokis
dedicated when they had put to flight the Thessalian cavalry in the
second engagement.[^622] The Phliasians brought to Delphi a bronze Zeus,
and with the Zeus, an image of Aegina. The Mantineians of Arcadia
dedicated a bronze Apollo, which stands near the treasury of the
Corinthians.

Hēraklēs and Apollo are holding onto the tripod and are preparing to
fight about it. Leto and Artemis are calming Apollo, and Athena is
calming Hēraklēs. This too is an offering of the people of Phokis,
dedicated when Tellias of Elis led them against the Thessalians. Athena
and Artemis were made by Khionis, the other images are works shared by
Diyllus and Amyklaios. They are said to be Corinthians.

The Delphians say that when Hēraklēs the son of Amphitryon came to the
oracle, the prophetess Xenocleia refused to give a response on the
ground that he was guilty of the death of Iphitos. Then Hēraklēs took up
the tripod and carried it out of the temple. Then the prophetess said:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

Then there was another Hēraklēs, of Tiryns, not the Canopian.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

For before this, the Egyptian Hēraklēs had visited Delphi. On the
occasion to which I refer, the son of Amphitryon restored the tripod to
Apollo and was told by Xenocleia all he wished to know. The poets
adopted the story and sing about a fight between Hēraklēs and Apollo for
a tripod.

of Onatas the Aeginetan, and Ageladas the Argive, and consist of statues
of footmen and horsemen—Opis, king of the Iapygians, who had become an
ally to the Peucetii. Opis is represented as killed in the fighting, and
on his prostrate body, stand the hero Taras and Phalanthus of
Lacedaemon, near whom is a dolphin. For they say that before Phalanthus

The axes were dedicated by Periklytos, son of Euthymakhos, a man of
Tenedos, and allude to an old story. Kyknos, they say, was a son of
Poseidon and ruled as king in Colonae, a city in the Troad situated
opposite the island Leucophrys.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.14.2">

He had a daughter, by name Hemithea, and a son, called Tennes, by
Procleia, who was a daughter of Klytios and a sister of Caletor. Homer
in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>[^623] says that
this Caletor, as he was putting the fire under the ship of Protesilaos,
was killed by Ajax. Procleia died before Kyknos, and his second wife,
Philonome, daughter of Cragasus, fell in love with Tennes. Rejected by
him, she falsely accused him before her husband, saying that he had made
love to her, and she had rejected him. Kyknos was deceived by the trick,
placed Tennes with his sister in a chest, and launched it out to sea.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.14.3">

The young people came safely to the island Leucophrys, and the island
was given its present name from Tennes. Kyknos, however, was not to
remain for ever ignorant of the trick and sailed to his son to confess
his ignorance and to ask for pardon for his mistake. He put in at the
island and fastened the cables of his ship to something—a rock or a
tree—but Tennes in a passion cut them adrift with an axe.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.14.4">

For this reason a byword has arisen, which is used of those who make a
stern refusal: “So and so has cut whatever it may be with an axe of
Tenedos.” The Greeks say that while Tennes was defending his country, he
was killed by Achilles. In course of time, weakness compelled the people
of Tenedos to merge themselves with the Alexandrians on the Troad
mainland.

The Greeks who fought against the king, besides dedicating at Olympia a
bronze Zeus, dedicated also an Apollo at Delphi, from spoils taken in
the naval actions at Artemisium and Salamis. There is also a story that
Themistocles came to Delphi bringing with him for Apollo some of the
Persian spoils. He asked whether he should dedicate them within the
temple, but the Pythian priestess ordered him to carry them from the
sanctuary altogether. The part of the oracle referring to this runs as
follows:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The splendid beauty of the Persian’s spoils

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Set not within my temple. Dispatch them home speedily.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.14.6">

Now, I greatly marveled that it was from Themistocles alone that the
priestess refused to accept spoils taken from the Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persēs</span>\]. Some thought
that the god would have rejected alike all offerings from Persian
spoils, if like Themistocles the others had inquired of Apollo before
making their dedication. Others said that the god knew that Themistocles
would become a suppliant of the Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persēs</span>\] king and
refused to take the gifts so that Themistocles might not by a dedication
render the Persian’s enmity unappeasable. The expedition of the
barbarian against Greece we find foretold in the oracles of Bacis, and
Euklos composed
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>\] his verses
about it at an even earlier date.

Near the great altar is a bronze wolf, an offering of the Delphians
themselves. They say that a fellow robbed the god of some treasure and
kept himself and the gold hidden at the place on Mount Parnassus where
the forest is thickest. As he slept, a wolf attacked and killed him, and
every day went to the city and howled. When the people began to realize
that the matter was not without the intervention of the god
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">theos</span>\], they followed
the beast and found the sacred gold. So to the god, they dedicated a
bronze wolf.

A gilded statue of Phryne was made by Praxiteles, one of her lovers, but
it was Phryne herself who dedicated the statue. The offerings next to
Phryne include two images of Apollo, one dedicated from Persian spoils
by the Epidaurians of Argolis, the other dedicated by the Megarians to
commemorate a victory over the Athenians at Nisaia. The Plataeans have
dedicated an ox, an offering made at the time when, in their own
territory, they took part, along with the other Greeks, in the defense
against Mardonios, the son of Gobryas. Then there are another two images
of Apollo, one dedicated by the citizens of Herakleia on the Euxine, the

damaged in parts.

I myself put the blame on rogues and thieves. But Kleitodemos, the
oldest writer to describe the customs of the Athenians, says in his
account of Attica that when the Athenians were preparing the Sicilian
expedition a vast flock of crows swooped on Delphi, pecked this image
all over, and with their beaks, tore away its gold. He says that the
crows also broke off the spear, the owls, and the imitation fruit on the
palm tree.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.15.6">

Kleitodemos describes other omens that told the Athenians to beware of
sailing against Sicily. The Cyrenaeans have dedicated at Delphi a figure
of Battos in a chariot; he it was who brought them in ships from Thera
to Libya. The reins are held by Cyrene, and in the chariot is Battos,
who is being garlanded by Libya. The artist was a Cnossian, Amphion, the
son of Acestor.

It is said that, after Battos had founded Cyrene, he was cured of his
stammering[^624] in the following way. As he was passing through the
territory of the Cyrenaeans, in the extreme parts of it, as yet desert,
he saw a lion, and the terror of the sight compelled him to cry out in a
clear and loud voice. Not far from the Battos, the Amphiktyones have set
up yet another Apollo from the fine they inflicted on the people of
Phokis for their sin against the god.

Of the offerings sent by the Lydian kings, I found nothing remaining

welding, which is the only thing that fastens and holds together the
iron.

The shape of the stand is very like that of a tower, wider at the bottom

to plough. The Aetolian nation, having subdued their neighbors the
Acarnanians, sent statues of generals and images of Apollo and Artemis.

priestess to engage the Etruscans with the fewest possible ships. So
they put out against the Etruscans with five triremes. Their enemies,
refusing to admit that their seamanship was unequal to that of the
Liparaeans, went out to meet them with an equal number of ships. These
the Liparaeans captured, as they did a second five that came out against
them, overcoming too a third squadron of five, and likewise a fourth. So
they dedicated at Delphi images of Apollo equal in number to the ships
that they had captured.

Of the barbarians in the west, the people of Sardinia have sent a bronze
statue of him after whom they are called. In size and prosperity,
Sardinia is the equal of the most celebrated islands. What the ancient
name was that the natives give it, I do not know, but those of the
Greeks who sailed there to trade called it Ichnussa, because the shape
of the island is very like a man’s footprint
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ichnos</span>\]. Its length is
one thousand one hundred and twenty stadium-lengths, and its width
extends to four hundred and twenty.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.2">

The first sailors to cross to the island are said to have been Libyans.
Their leader was Sardus, son of Maceris, the Maceris surnamed Hēraklēs
by the Egyptians and Libyans. Maceris himself was celebrated chiefly for
his journey to Delphi, but Sardus it was who led the Libyans to
Ichnussa, and after him the island was renamed. However, the Libyan army
did not expel the aborigines, who received the invaders as settlers
through compulsion rather than in goodwill. Neither the Libyans nor the
native population knew how to build cities. They dwelled in scattered
groups, where chance found them a home in cabins or caves.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.3">

Years after the Libyans, there came to the island from Greece Aristaios
and his followers. Aristaios is said to have been a son of Apollo and
Cyrene, and they say that, deeply grieved by the fate of Actaeon, and
vexed alike with Boeotia and the whole of Greece, he migrated to
Sardinia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.4">

Others think that Daidalos too ran away from Camicus on this occasion,
because of the invasion of the Cretans, and took a part in the colony
that Aristaios led to Sardinia. But it is nonsense to think that
Daidalos, a contemporary of Oedipus, king of Thebes, had a part in a
colony or anything else along with Aristaios, who married Autonoe, the
daughter of Kadmos. At any rate, these colonists too founded no city,
the reason being, I think, that neither in numbers nor in strength were
they capable of the task.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.5">

After Aristaios, the Iberians crossed to Sardinia, under Norax as leader
of the expedition, and they founded the city of Nora. The tradition is
that this was the first city in the island, and they say that Norax was
a son of Erytheia, the daughter of Geryones, with Hermes for his father.
A fourth component part of the population was the army of Iolaos,
consisting of Thespians and men from Attica, which put in at Sardinia
and founded Olbia; by themselves the Athenians founded Ogryle, either in
commemoration of one of their parishes in the homeland or else because
one Ogrylus himself took part in the expedition. Be this as it may,
there are still today places in Sardinia called Iolaia, and Iolaos is
worshipped by the inhabitants.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.6">

When Troy was taken, among those Trojans who fled were those who escaped
with Aeneas. A part of them, carried from their course by winds, reached
Sardinia and intermarried with the Greeks already settled there. But the
barbarian element were prevented from coming to blows with the Greeks
and Trojans, for the two enemies were evenly matched in all warlike
equipment, while the river Thorsus, flowing between their territories,
made both equally afraid to cross it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.7">

However, many years afterwards the Libyans crossed again to the island
with a stronger army, and began a war against the Greeks. The Greeks
were utterly destroyed or only a few of them survived. The Trojans made
their escape to the high parts of the island and occupied mountains
difficult to climb, being precipitous and protected by stakes. Even at
the present day, they are called Ilians, but in figure, in the fashion
of their arms, and in their mode of living generally, they are like the
Libyans.

Not far distant from Sardinia is an island called Kyrnos by the Greeks,
but Corsica by the Libyans who inhabit it. A large part of the
population, oppressed by civil strife, left it and came to Sardinia;
there they took up their abode, confining themselves to the highlands.
The Sardinians, however, call them by the name of Corsicans, which they
brought with them from home.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.9">

When the Carthaginians were at the height of their sea power, they
overcame all in Sardinia except the Ilians and Corsicans, who were kept
from slavery by the strength of the mountains. These Carthaginians, like
those who preceded them, founded cities in the island, namely, Caralis
and Sulci. Some of the Carthaginian mercenaries, either Libyans or
Iberians, quarrelled about the loot, mutinied in a passion, and added to
the number of the highland settlers. Their name in the Cyrnian language
is Balari, which is the Cyrnian word for fugitives.

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">SARDINIA, GEOGRAPHY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.10">

These are the people that dwell in Sardinia, and such was the method of
their settlement. The northern part of the island and that towards the
mainland of Italy consist of an unbroken chain of impassable mountains.
And if you sail along the coast, you will find no anchorage on this side
of the island, while violent but irregular gusts of wind sweep down to
the sea from the tops of the mountains.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.11">

Across the middle of the island runs another chain of mountains, but
lower in height. The atmosphere here is on the whole heavy and
unwholesome. The reason is partly the salt that crystallizes here,
partly the oppressive, violent south wind, and partly the fact that,
because of the height of the mountains on the side towards Italy, the
north winds are prevented, when they blow in summer, from cooling the
atmosphere and the ground here. Others say that the cause is Cyrnus,
which is separated from Sardinia by no more than eight stadium-lengths
of sea and is hilly and high all over. So they think that Cyrnus
prevents the west wind and the north wind from reaching as far as
Sardinia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.12">

Neither poisonous nor harmless snakes can live in Sardinia, nor yet
wolves. The he-goats are no bigger than those found elsewhere, but their
shape is that of the wild ram which an artist would carve in Aeginetan
style, except that their breasts are too shaggy to liken them to
Aeginetan art. Their horns do not stand out away from the head but curl
straight beside the ears. In speed, they are the swiftest of all beasts.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.17.13">

Except for one plant, the island is free from poisons. This deadly herb
is like celery, and they say that those who eat it die laughing. That is
why Homer,[^626] and men after him, call unwholesome laughter sardonic.
The herb grows mostly around springs, but does not impart any of its
poison to the water.

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\]. The Achaeans
dedicated an image of Athena after reducing by siege one of the cities
of Aetolia, the name of which was Phana. They say that the siege was not
a short one, and being unable to take the city, they sent envoys to
Delphi, to whom was given the following response:

So not understanding what was the meaning of the oracle, they were
minded to raise the siege and sail away, while the defenders paid no
attention to them, one of their women coming from behind the walls to
fetch water from the spring just under them. Some of the besiegers ran
up and took the woman prisoner, who informed the Achaeans that the
scanty water from the spring that was fetched each night was rationed
among the besieged, who had nothing else to quench their thirst. So the
Achaeans, by filling up the spring, captured the town.

fields, was chasing a she-donkey with harsh braying and wanton gait,
while the driver of the donkey increased the din by his horrible,

frightened, and the Ambraciots, detecting the trap prepared for them,

The men of Orneaiin Argolis, when hard pressed in war by the Sikyonians,
vowed to Apollo that, if they should drive the host of the Sikyonians
out of their native land, they would organize a daily procession in his
honor at Delphi and sacrifice victims of a certain kind and of a certain
number. Well, they conquered the Sikyonians in battle. But finding the
daily fulfillment of their vow a great expense and a still greater
trouble, they devised the trick of dedicating to the god bronze figures
representing a sacrifice and a procession.

There is here one of the labors of Hēraklēs, namely, his fight with the
hydra. Tisagoras not only dedicated the offering, but also made it. Both
the hydra and Hēraklēs are of iron. To make images of iron is a very
difficult task, involving great labor. So the work of Tisagoras, whoever
he was, is marvelous. Very marvelous too are the heads of a lion and
wild boar at Pergamon, also of iron, which were made as offerings to
Dionysus.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.18.7">

The people of Phokis who live at Elateia, who held their city, with the
help of Olympiodoros from Athens, when besieged by Kassandros, sent to
Apollo at Delphi a bronze lion. The Apollo, very near to the lion, was
dedicated by the Massiliots as first fruits of their naval victory over
the Carthaginians. The Aetolians have made a trophy and the image of an
armed woman, supposed to represent Aetolia. These were dedicated by the
Aetolians when they had punished the Gauls for their cruelty to the
Kallians. A gilded statue, offered by Gorgias of Leontinoi, is a
portrait of Gorgias himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.1">

Beside the Gorgias is a votive offering of the Amphiktyones,
representing Skyllis of Scione, who, the story
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">phēmē</span>\] says, dived
into the very deepest parts of every sea. He also taught his daughter
Hydna to dive.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.2">

When the fleet of Xerxes was attacked by a violent storm off Mount
Pelion, father and daughter completed its destruction by dragging away
under the sea the anchors and any other security the triremes had. In
return for this deed, the Amphiktyones dedicated statues of Skyllis and
his daughter. The statue of Hydna completed the number of the statues
that Nero carried off from Delphi. Only those of the female sex who are
pure virgins may dive into the sea.[^627]

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.3">

I am going on to tell a Lesbian story. Certain fishermen of Methymna
found that their nets dragged up to the surface of the sea a face made
of olive wood. Its appearance suggested a touch of divinity, but it was
outlandish, and unlike the normal features of Greek gods. So the people
of Methymna asked the Pythian priestess of what god or hero the figure
was a likeness, and she ordered them to worship Dionysus Phallen. Then
the people of Methymna kept for themselves the wooden image out of the
sea, worshipping it with sacrifices and prayers, but sent a bronze copy
to Delphi.

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">TEMPLE OF APOLLON AT DELPHI</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.4">

The carvings in the pediments are: Artemis, Leto, Apollo, Muses, a
setting Sun, and Dionysus together with the Thyiad women. The first of
them are the work of Praxias, an Athenian and a pupil of Kalamis, but
the temple took some time to build, during which Praxias died. So the
rest of the ornament in the pediments was carved by Androsthenes, like
Praxias an Athenian by birth, but a pupil of Eukadmos. There are arms of
gold on the architraves; the Athenians dedicated the shields from spoils
taken at the battle of Marathon, and the Aetolians the arms, supposed to
be Gallic, behind and on the left. Their shape is very like that of
Persian \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persika</span>\]
wicker shields.

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">INVASION OF THE GAULS,
HISTORY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.5">

I have made some mention of the Gallic invasion of Greece in my
description of the Athenian Council Chamber.[^628] But I have resolved
to give a more detailed account of the Gauls in my description of
Delphi, because the greatest of the Greek exploits against the
barbarians took place there. The Celts conducted their first
\[invading\] expedition under the leadership of Cambaules. Advancing as
far as Thrace, they lost heart and broke off their march, realizing that
they were too few in number to be a match for the Greeks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.6">

But when they decided to invade the territory of others a second time,
so great was the influence of Cambaules’ veterans, who had tasted the
joy of plunder and acquired a passion for robbery and plunder, that a
large force of infantry and no small number of mounted men attended the
muster. So the army was split up into three divisions by the chieftains,
to each of whom was assigned a separate land to invade.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.7">

Kerethrios was to be leader against the Thracians and the nation of the
Triballi. The invaders of Paionia were under the command of Brennus and
Acichorius. Bolgius attacked the Macedonians and Illyrians and engaged
in a struggle with Ptolemy, king of the Macedonians at that time. It was
this Ptolemy who, though he had taken refuge as a suppliant with
Seleukos, the son of Antiokhos, treacherously murdered him and was
surnamed Thunderbolt because of his recklessness. Ptolemy himself
perished in the fighting, and the Macedonian losses were heavy. But once
more, the Celts lacked courage to advance against Greece, and so the
second expedition returned home.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.8">

It was then that Brennus, both in public meetings and also in personal
talks with individual Gallic officers, strongly urged a campaign against
Greece, enlarging on the weakness of Greece at the time, on the wealth
of the Greek states, and on the even greater wealth in sanctuaries,
including votive offerings and coined silver and gold. So he induced the
Gauls to march against Greece. Among the officers he chose to be his
colleagues was Acichorius.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.9">

The muster of foot amounted to one hundred and fifty-two thousand, with
twenty thousand four hundred horsemen. This was the number of horsemen
in action at any one time, but the real number was sixty-one thousand
two hundred. For to each horseman were attached two servants, who were
themselves skilled riders and, like their masters, had a horse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.10">

When the Gallic horsemen were engaged, the servants remained behind the
ranks and proved useful in the following way. Should a horseman or his
horse fall, the slave brought him a horse to mount; if the rider was
killed, the slave mounted the horse in his master’s place; if both rider
and horse were killed, there was a mounted man ready. When a rider was
wounded, one slave brought back to camp the wounded man, while the other
took his vacant place in the ranks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.11">

I believe that the Gauls in adopting these methods copied the regiment
of the Ten Thousand among the Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">en Persais</span>\], who were
called the Immortals. There was, however, this difference. The Persians
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persai</span>\] used to wait
until the battle was over before replacing casualties, while the Gauls
kept reinforcing the horsemen to their full number during the height of
the action. This organization is called in their native speech
trimarcisia, for I would have you know that marca is the Celtic name for
a horse.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.19.12">

This was the size of the army, and such was the intention of Brennus,
when he attacked Greece. The spirit of the Greeks was utterly broken,
but the extremity of their terror forced them to defend Greece. They
realized that the struggle that faced them would not be one for liberty,
as it was when they fought the Persian, and that giving water and earth
would not bring them safety. They still remembered the fate of
Macedonia, Thrace, and Paionia during the former incursion of the Gauls,
and reports were coming in of enormities committed at that very time on
the Thessalians. So every man, as well as every state, was convinced
that they must either conquer or perish.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.1">

Anyone who so wishes can compare the number of those who mustered to
meet King Xerxes at Thermopylae with those who now mustered to oppose
the Gauls. To meet the Persians, there came Greek contingents of the
following strength. Lacedaemonians with Leonidas not more than three
hundred; Tegeans five hundred, and five hundred from Mantineia; from
Orkhomenos in Arcadia a hundred and twenty; from the other cities in
Arcadia one thousand; from Mycenae eighty; from Phleious two hundred,
and from Corinth twice this number; of the Boeotians there mustered
seven hundred from Thespiae and four hundred from Thebes. A thousand men
of Phokis guarded the path on Mount Oitē, and the number of these should
be added to the Greek total.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.2">

Herodotus[^629] does not give the number of the people of Lokris who
live at the base of Mount Knemis, but he does say that each of their
cities sent a contingent. It is possible, however, to make an estimate
of these also that comes very near to the truth. For not more than nine
thousand Athenians marched to Marathon, even if we include those who
were too old for active service and slaves; so the number of the
fighting men of Lokris who marched to Thermopylae cannot have exceeded
six thousand. So the whole army would amount to eleven thousand two
hundred. But it is well known that not even these remained all the time
guarding the pass; for if we except the Lacedaemonians, Thespians, and
Mycenaeans, the rest left the field before the conclusion of the
fighting.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.3">

To meet the barbarians who came from the Okeanos, the following Greek
forces came to Thermopylae. Of the Boeotians, ten thousand hoplites and
five hundred cavalry, the Boeotarchs being Kephisodotos, Thearidas,
Diogenes, and Lysander. From Phokis came five hundred cavalry with
footmen three thousand in number. The generals of the men of Phokis were
Kritoboulos and Antiokhos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.4">

The men from Lokris stationed over against the island of Atalanta were
under the command of Meidias; they numbered seven hundred, and no
cavalry was with them. Of the Megarians came four hundred hoplites
commanded by Hipponikos of Megara. The Aetolians sent a large
contingent, including every class of fighting men; the number of cavalry
is not given, but the light-armed were seven hundred and ninety, and
their hoplites numbered more than seven thousand. Their leaders were
Polyarkhos, Polyphron, and Lakrates.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.5">

The Athenian general was Kallippos, the son of Moirokles, as I have said
in an earlier part of my work,[^630] and their forces consisted of all
their seaworthy triremes, five hundred horse, and one thousand foot.
Because of their ancient reputation, the Athenians held the chief
command. The king of Macedonia sent five hundred mercenaries, and the
king of Asia a like number; the leader of those sent by Antigonos was
Aristodemos, a Macedonian, and Telesarkhos, one of the Syrians on the
Orontes, commanded the forces that Antiokhos sent from Asia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.6">

When the Greeks assembled at Thermopylae[^631] learned that the army of
the Gauls was already in the neighborhood of Magnesia and Phthiōtis,
they resolved to detach the cavalry and a thousand light armed troops
and to send them to the Sperkheios, so that even the crossing of the
river could not be achieved by the barbarians without a struggle and
risks. On their arrival, these forces broke down the bridges and by
themselves encamped along the bank. But Brennus himself was not utterly
stupid nor inexperienced for a barbarian in devising tricks of strategy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.7">

So on that very night, he dispatched some troops to the Sperkheios, not
to the places where the old bridges had stood, but lower down, where the
Greeks would not notice the crossing, and just where the river spread
over the plain and made a marsh and lake instead of a narrow, violent
stream. Here Brennus sent some ten thousand Gauls, picking out the
swimmers and the tallest men; and the Celts as a people are far taller
than any other .

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.8">

So these crossed in the night, swimming over the river where it expands
into a lake; each man used his shield, his national buckler, as a raft,
and the tallest of them were able to cross the water by wading. The
Greeks on the Sperkheios, as soon as they learned that a detachment of
the barbarians had crossed by the marsh, forthwith retreated to the main
army. Brennus ordered the dwellers around the Malian gulf to build
bridges across the Sperkheios, and they proceeded to accomplish their
task with a will, for they were frightened of Brennus, and anxious for
the barbarians to go away out of their country instead of staying to
devastate it further.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.20.9">

Brennus brought his army across over the bridges and proceeded to
Herakleia. The Gauls plundered the country and massacred those whom they
caught in the fields but did not capture the city. For a year previous
to this, the Aetolians had forced Herakleia to join the Aetolian League;
so now, they defended a city which they considered to belong to them
just as much as to the people of Herakleia.

</div>

Brennus did not trouble himself much about Herakleia but directed his
efforts to driving away those opposed to him at the pass in order to
invade Greece south of Thermopylae.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.21.1">

Deserters kept Brennus informed about the forces from each city mustered
at Thermopylae. So despising the Greek army, he advanced from Herakleia
and began the battle at sunrise on the next day. He had no Greek
soothsayer and made no use of his own country’s sacrifices, if indeed
the Celts have any art of divination. Then the Greeks attacked silently
and in good order. When they came to close quarters, the infantry did
not rush out of their line far enough to disturb their proper formation,
while the light-armed troops remained in position, throwing javelins,
shooting arrows, or slinging bullets.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.21.2">

The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is
not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most
of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams. The Gauls
were worse armed than the Greeks, having no other defensive armor than
their national shields, while they were still more inferior in war
experience.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.21.3">

On they marched against their enemies with the unreasoning fury and
passion of brutes. Slashed with axe or sword, they kept their
desperation while they still breathed; pierced by arrow or javelin, they
did not abate of their passion so long as life remained. Some drew out
from their wounds the spears, by which they had been hit, and threw them
at the Greeks or used them in close fighting.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.21.4">

Meanwhile, the Athenians on the triremes, with difficulty and with
danger, nevertheless coasted along through the mud that extends far out
to sea, brought their ships as close to the barbarians as possible, and
raked them with arrows and every other kind of missile. The Celts were
in unspeakable distress, and as in the confined space, they inflicted
few losses but suffered twice or four times as many, their captains gave
the signal to retire to their camp. Retreating in confusion and without
any order, many were crushed beneath the feet of their friends, and many
others fell into the swamp and disappeared under the mud. Their loss in
the retreat was no less than the loss that occurred while the battle
raged.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.21.5">

On this day, the Attic contingent surpassed the other Greeks in courage.
Of the Athenians themselves, the bravest was Cydias, a young man who had
never before been in battle. He was killed by the Gauls, but his
relatives dedicated his shield to Zeus, God of Freedom, and the
inscription ran:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Here hang I, yearning for the still youthful bloom of Cydias,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The shield of a glorious man, an offering to Zeus.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

I was the very first through which at this battle he thrust his left
arm,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When the battle raged furiously against the Gaul.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.21.6">

This inscription remained until Sulla and his army took away, among
other Athenian treasures, the shields in the porch of Zeus, God of
Freedom. After this battle at Thermopylae, the Greeks buried their own
dead and despoiled the barbarians, but the Gauls sent no herald to ask
leave to take up the bodies and were indifferent whether the earth
received them or whether they were devoured by wild beasts or carrion
birds.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.21.7">

There were in my opinion two reasons that made them careless about the
burial of their dead: they wished to strike terror into their enemies,
and through habit, they have no tender feeling for those who have gone.
In the battle there fell forty of the Greeks; the losses of the
barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them
that disappeared beneath the mud was great.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.1">

On the seventh day after the battle, a regiment of Gauls attempted to go
up to Oitē by way of Herakleia. Here too a narrow path rises just past
the ruins of Trakhis. There was also at that time a sanctuary of Athena
above the Trachinian territory, and in it were votive offerings. So they
hoped to ascend Oitē by this path and at the same time to get possession
of the offerings in the temple in passing. \<This path was defended by
the men of Phokis under Telesarkhos.\> They overcame the barbarians in
the engagement, but Telesarkhos himself fell, a man devoted, if ever a
man was, to the Greek cause \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">es
tà Hellēnōn</span>\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.2">

All the leaders of the barbarians except Brennus were terrified of the
Greeks, and at the same time were despondent of the future, seeing that
their present condition showed no signs of improvement. But Brennus
reasoned that if he could compel the Aetolians to return home to
Aetolia, he would find the war against Greece prove easier hereafter. So
he detached from his army forty thousand foot and about eight hundred
horse. Over these, he set in command Orestorius and Combutis,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.3">

who, making their way back by way of the bridges over the Sperkheios and
across Thessaly again, invaded Aetolia. The fate of the Kallians at the
hands of Combutis and Orestorius is the most wicked ever heard of and is
without a parallel in the crimes of men. Every male they put to the
sword, and there were butchered old men equally with children at their
mothers’ breasts. The more plump of these sucking babies the Gauls
killed, drinking their blood and eating their flesh.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.4">

Women and adult virgins, if they had any spirit at all in them,
anticipated their end when the city was captured. Those who survived
suffered under imperious violence every form of outrage at the hands of
men equally void of pity or of love. Every woman who chanced to find a
Gallic sword committed suicide. The others were soon to die of hunger
and want of sleep, the incontinent barbarians outraging them by turns,
and satisfying their lust even on the dying and the dead.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.5">

The Aetolians had been informed by messengers what disasters had
befallen them and, at once with all speed, removed their forces from
Thermopylae and hastened to Aetolia, being exasperated at the sufferings
of the Kallians and still more fired with determination to save the
cities not yet captured. From all the cities at home were mobilized the
men of military age; and even those too old for service, their fighting
spirit roused by the crisis, were in the ranks, and their very women
gladly served with them, being even more enraged against the Gauls than
were the men.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.6">

When the barbarians, having pillaged houses and sanctuaries, and having
fired Kallion, were returning by the same way, they were met by the men
of Patrai, who alone of the Achaeans were helping the Aetolians. Being
trained as hoplites, they made a frontal attack on the barbarians but
suffered severely owing to the number and desperation of the Gauls. But
the Aetolians, men and women, drawn up all along the road, kept shooting
at the barbarians, and few shots failed to find a mark among enemies
protected by nothing but their epichoric
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">epikhōrioi</span>\] shields.
Pursued by the Gauls, they easily escaped, renewing their attack with
vigor when their enemies returned from the pursuit.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.7">

Although the Kallians suffered so terribly that even Homer’s account of
the Laestrygones and the Cyclops[^632] does not seem outside the truth,
yet they were duly and fully avenged. For out of their number of forty
thousand eight hundred, there escaped of the barbarians to the camp at
Thermopylae less than one half.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.8">

Meanwhile, the Greeks at Thermopylae were faring as follows. There are
two paths across Mount Oitē: the one above Trakhis is very steep, and
for the most part precipitous; the other, through the territory of the
Aenianians, is easier for an army to cross. It was through this that on
a former occasion, Hydarnes the Persian passed to attack in the rear the
Greeks under Leonidas.[^633]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.9">

By this road the Herakleia and of Ainiania promised to lead Brennus, not
that they were ill disposed to the Greek cause, but because they were
anxious for the Celts to go away from their country and not to establish
themselves in it to its ruin. I think that Pindar[^634] spoke the truth
again when he said that everyone is crushed by his own misfortunes but
is untouched by the woes of others.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.10">

Brennus was encouraged by the promise made by the Ainiania and of
Herakleia. Leaving Acichorius behind in charge of the main army, with
instructions that it was to attack only when the enveloping movement was
complete, Brennus himself, with a detachment of forty thousand, began
his march along the pass.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.11">

It so happened on that day that the mist rolled thick down the mountain,
darkening the sun, so that the men of Phokis who were guarding the path
found the barbarians upon them before they were aware of their approach.
Then the Gauls attacked. The men of Phokis resisted manfully, but at
last were forced to retreat from the path. However, they succeeded in
running down to their friends with a report of what was happening before
the envelopment of the Greek army was quite complete on all sides.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.12">

Then the Athenians with the fleet succeeded in withdrawing in time the
Greek forces from Thermopylae, which disbanded and returned to their
several homes. Brennus, without delaying any longer, began his march
against Delphi without waiting for the army with Acichorius to join up.
In terror, the Delphians took refuge in the oracle. The god ordered them
not to be afraid and promised that he would himself defend his own.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.22.13">

The Greeks who came in defense of the god were as follow: the men of
Phokis, who came from all their cities; from Amphissa, four hundred
hoplites; from the Aetolians, a few came at once on hearing of the
advance of the barbarians, and later on, Philomēlos brought one thousand
two hundred. The flower of the Aetolians turned against the army of
Acichorius, and without offering battle, attacked continuously the rear
of their line of march, plundering the baggage and putting the carriers
to the sword. It was chiefly for this reason that their march proved
slow. Futhermore, at Herakleia Acichorius had left a part of his army,
who were to guard the baggage of the camp.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.1">

Brennus and his army were now faced by the Greeks who had mustered at
Delphi, and soon, portents boding no good to the barbarians were sent by
the god, the clearest recorded in history. For the whole ground occupied
by the Gallic army was shaken violently most of the day, with continuous
thunder and lightning.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.2">

The thunder both terrified the Gauls and prevented them hearing their
orders, while the bolts from the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\] set on fire
not only those whom they struck but also their neighbors, themselves,
and their armor alike. Then there were seen by them ghosts of the heroes
Hyperochus, Laodocus, and Pyrrhos; according to some, a fourth appeared,
Phylacus, a local hero of Delphi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.3">

Among the many men of Phokis who were killed in the action was
Aleximakhos, who in this battle excelled all the other Greeks in
devoting youth, physical strength, and a stout heart, to slaying the
barbarians. The people of Phokis made a statue of Aleximakhos and sent
it to Delphi as an offering to Apollo.

All the day, the barbarians were beset by calamities and terrors of this
kind. But the night was to bring upon them experiences far more painful.
For there came on a severe frost and snow with it; and great rocks
slipping from Parnassus, and crags breaking away, made the barbarians
their target, the crash of which brought destruction, not on one or two
at a time, but on thirty or even more, as they chanced to be gathered in
groups, keeping guard or taking rest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.5">

At sunrise, the Greeks came on from Delphi, making a frontal attack with
the exception of the men of Phokis, who, being more familiar with the
district, descended through the snow down the precipitous parts of
Parnassus, and surprised the Celts in their rear, shooting them down
with arrows and javelins without anything to fear from the barbarians.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.6">

At the beginning of the fight, the Gauls offered a spirited resistance,
especially the company attached to Brennus, which was composed of the
tallest and bravest of the Gauls, even though they were shot at from all
sides, and no less distressed by the frost, especially the wounded men.
But when Brennus himself was wounded, he was carried fainting from the
battle, and the barbarians, harassed on all sides by the Greeks, fell
back reluctantly, putting to the sword those who, disabled by wounds or
sickness, could not go with them.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.7">

They encamped where night overtook them in their retreat, and during the
night, there fell on them a “panic.” For causeless terrors are said to
come from the god Pan. It was when evening was turning to night that the
confusion fell on the army, and at first, only a few became mad, and
these imagined that they heard the trampling of horses at a gallop, and
the attack of advancing enemies; but after a little time, the delusion
spread to all.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.8">

So rushing to arms, they divided into two parties, killing and being
killed, neither understanding their mother tongue nor recognizing one
another’s forms or the shape of their shields. Both parties alike under
the present delusion thought that their opponents were Greek, men and
armor, and that the language they spoke was Greek, so that a great
mutual slaughter took place among the Gauls, caused by the madness sent
by the god.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.9">

Those men of Phokis who had been left behind in the fields to guard the
flocks were the first to perceive and report to the Greeks the panic
that had seized the barbarians in the night. The men of Phokis were thus
encouraged to attack the Celts with yet greater spirit, keeping a more
careful watch on their encampments, and not letting them take from the
country the necessities of life without a struggle, so that the whole
Gallic army suffered at once from a pressing shortage of wheat and other
food.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.10">

Their losses in Phokis were these: in the battles were killed close on
six thousand; those who perished in the wintry storm at night and
afterwards in the panic terror amounted to over ten thousand, as
likewise did those who were starved to death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.11">

Athenian scouts arrived at Delphi to gather information, after which
they returned and reported what had happened to the barbarians, and all
that the god had inflicted upon them. Then the Athenians took the field,
and as they marched through Boeotia they were joined by the Boeotians.
Thus the combined armies followed the barbarians, lying in wait and
killing those who happened to be the last.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.12">

Those who fled with Brennus had been joined by the army under Acichorius
only on the previous night. For the Aetolians had delayed their march,
hurling at them a merciless shower of javelins and anything else they
could lay hands on, so that only a small part of them escaped to the
camp at Herakleia. There was still a hope of saving the life of Brennus,
so far as his wounds were concerned; but, they say, partly because he
feared his fellow countrymen, and still more because he was conscience
stricken at the calamities he had brought on Greece, he took his own
life by drinking neat wine.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.13">

After this, the barbarians proceeded with difficulty as far as the
Sperkheios, pressed hotly by the Aetolians. But after their arrival at
the Sperkheios, during the rest of the retreat, the Thessalians and
Malians kept lying in wait for them, and so took their fill of slaughter
that not a Gaul returned home in safety.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.23.14">

The expedition of the Celts against Greece, and their destruction, took
place when Anaxikrates was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, in
the second year of the hundred and twenty-fifth Olympiad \[279 BCE\]
when Ladas of Aigion was victor in the foot race. In the following year,
when Demokles was archon
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">arkhōn</span>\] in Athens, the
Celts crossed back again to Asia.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.24.1">

Such was the course of the war. In the fore temple at Delphi are written
maxims useful for the life of men, inscribed by those whom the Greeks
say were sages. These were: from Ionia, Thales of Miletus and Bias of
Priene; of the Aeolians in Lesbos, Pittacus of Mitylene; of the Dorians
in Asia, Kleoboulos of Lindus; Solon of Athens and Khilon of Sparta; the
seventh sage, according to the list of Plato,[^635] the son of Ariston,
is not Periandros, the son of Kypselos, but Myson of Chenae, a village
on Mount Oitē. These sages, then, came to Delphi and dedicated to Apollo
the celebrated maxims, “Know thyself,” and “Nothing in excess.”

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.24.2">

So these men wrote what I have said, and you can see a bronze statue of
Homer on a slab, and read the oracle that they say Homer received:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Blessed and unhappy, for to be both were you born.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

You seek your fatherland; but no fatherland have you, only a motherland.

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

The island of Ios is the fatherland of your mother, which will receive
you

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

When you have died; but be on your guard against the riddle of the young
children.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

The inhabitants of Ios point to Homer’s tomb in the island, and in
another part to that of Clymene, who was, they say, the mother of Homer.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.24.3">

But the Cyprians, who also claim Homer as their own, say that Themisto,
one of their native women, was the mother of Homer, and that Euklos
foretold the birth of Homer in the following verses:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And then in sea girt Cyprus there will be a mighty singer,

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.24.4">

In the temple has been built an altar of Poseidon, because Poseidon too
possessed in part the most ancient oracle. There are also images of two
Fates; but in place of the third Fate, there stand by their side Zeus,
Guide of Fate, and Apollo, Guide of Fate. Here \[inside the temple\] you
may behold the hearth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hestiā</span>\] on which the
priest of Apollo killed Neoptolemos, the son of Achilles. The things
concerning the end of Neoptolemos I have told elsewhere.[^636]

Not far from the hearth
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hestiā</span>\] has been
dedicated a chair
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">thronos</span>\] of Pindar.
The chair is of iron, and on it they say Pindar sat whenever he came to
Delphi, and there composed his songs to Apollo. Into the innermost part

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">heortē</span>\] they place on

Next to it is a wall of no great size, and the ascent to the spring
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">pēgē</span>\] is through the

\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aduton</span>\] of the god, it

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">PAINTINGS BY POLYGNOTUS AT
DELPHI</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.1">

Beyond the Kassotis stands a building with paintings of Polygnotus. It
was dedicated by the people of Knidos, and is called by the Delphians
Leskhē (Place of Talk), because here in days of old they used to meet
and talk about the more serious matters and things that had to do with
myth. That there used to be many such places all over Greece is shown by
Homer’s words in the passage where Melantho abuses Odysseus:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

and you do not wish to go to a smithy to sleep,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

nor to a communal lodging for gossips \[*leskhē*\], but you keep
haranguing us here.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 18.328

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.2">

Inside this building the whole of the painting on the right depicts Troy
taken and the Greeks sailing away. On the ship of Menelaos, they are
preparing to put to sea. The ship is painted \[*graphein*\] with
children among the grown up sailors; amid ships is Phrontis the
steersman \[*kubernētēs*\] holding two boat hooks. Homer[^637]
represents \[*poieîn*\] Nestor as speaking about Phrontis in his
conversation with Telemachus, saying that he was the son of Onētor and
the steersman \[*kubernētēs*\] of Menelaos, of very high repute in his
craft, and how he came to his end when he was already rounding Sounion
in Attica. Up to this point, Menelaos had been sailing along with
Nestor, but now he was left behind to build Phrontis a
<span class="mark">tomb</span> \[*mnēmē*\] <span class="mark"></span>and
to pay him the due rites of burial.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.3">

Phrontis then is in the painting of Polygnotus, and beneath him is one
<span class="mark">Ithaimen</span>ēs carrying clothes, and Ekhoiax is
going down the gangway, carrying a bronze urn. Polites, Strophios, and
Alphios are pulling down the hut \[*skēnē*\] of Menelaos, which is not
far from the ship. Another hut \[*skēnē*\] is being pulled down by
Amphialos, at whose feet is seated a boy. There is no
<span class="mark">inscription \[*epigramma*\]</span> on the boy, and
Phrontis is the only one with a beard. His too is the only name that
Polygnotus took from the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>; the names of the
others he invented, I think, himself.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.4">

Briseis is standing with Diomede above her and Iphis in front of both;
they appear to be examining the form of Helen. Helen herself is sitting,
and so is Eurybates near her. We inferred that he was the
<span class="mark">herald \[*kērux*\]</span> of Odysseus, although he
had yet no beard. One handmaid, Panthalis, is standing beside Helen;
another, Electra, is fastening the sandals of her mistress. These names
too are different from those given by Homer in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>,[^638] where he
<span class="mark">tells of</span> \[*poieîn*\] Helen going to the wall
with her slave women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.5">

Beyond Helen, a man wrapped in a purple cloak is sitting in an attitude
of the deepest dejection; one might conjecture that he was Helenos, the
son of Priam, even before reading the <span class="mark">inscription
\[*epigramma*\]</span>. Near Helenos is Meges, who is wounded in the
arm, as Lescheos of Pyrrha, son of Aiskhylinos,
<span class="mark">describes</span> \[*poieîn*\] in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Sack of Troy</span>. For he says that
he was wounded by Admetos, son of Augeias, in the battle that the
Trojans fought in the night.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.6">

Beside Meges is also painted Lykomedes the son of Creon, who has a wound
in the wrist; Lescheos says he was so wounded by Agenor. So it is plain
that Polygnotus would not have <span class="mark">represented
\[*graphein*\]</span> them so wounded, if he had not read the
<span class="mark">poem</span> \[*poiēsis*\] of Lescheos. However, he
has painted Lykomedes as wounded also in the ankle and yet again in the
head. <span class="mark">Euryalos</span> the son of
<span class="mark">Mekisteus</span> has also received a wound in the
head and another in the wrist.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.7">

These are painted higher up than Helen in the picture \[*graphē*\]. Next
to Helen comes the mother of Theseus with her head shaved, and Demophon,
one of the sons of Theseus, is considering, to judge from his attitude
\[*skhēma*\], whether it will be possible for him to rescue Aithra. The
Argives say that Theseus had also a son Melanippos by the daughter of
Sinis and that Melanippos won a running race when the Epigonoi, as they
are called, held the second celebration of the Nemean Games, that of
Adrastos being the first.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.8">

Lescheos says of \[*poieîn*\] Aithra that, when Troy was taken, she came
stealthily to the Greek camp. She was recognized by the sons of Theseus,
and Demophon asked for her from Agamemnon. He was ready to grant the
favor \[*kharizesthai*\] to Demophon, but said that Helen must first
give her consent. He sent a <span class="mark">herald</span>
\[*kērux*\], and Helen granted him the <span class="mark">favor
\[*kharis*\]</span>. So in the painting \[*graphē*\], Eurybates appears
to have come to Helen to ask about Aithra, and to be saying what he had
been told to say by Agamemnon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.9">

The Trojan women are represented as already captives and lamenting.
Andromache is in the painting, and near stands her boy grasping her
breast; this child Lescheos says was put to death by being flung from
the tower, not that the Greeks had so decreed, but Neoptolemos, of his
own accord, was minded to murder him. In the painting is also
<span class="mark">Medesikaste</span>, another of Priam’s illegitimate
daughters, who according to Homer[^639] left her home and went to the
city of <span class="mark">Pedaion</span> to be the wife of Imbrios, the
son of Mentor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.10">

Andromache and <span class="mark">Medesikaste</span> are wearing
<span class="mark">head-coverings \[*kalumma*\]</span>, but the hair of
Polyxena is braided after the custom of <span class="mark">girls
\[*parthenoi*\]</span>. Poets sing of her death at the
<span class="mark">tomb</span> \[*mnēmē*\] of Achilles, and both in
Athens and in Pergamon-on-the-Kaïkos, I have seen the tragedy of
Polyxena depicted in paintings \[*graphē*, pl.\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.25.11">

The artist has painted Nestor with a cap on his head and a spear in his
hand. There is also a horse, in the attitude \[*skhēma*\] of one about
to roll in the dust. Right up to the horse, there is a beach with what
appear to be pebbles, but beyond the horse, the sea scene breaks off.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.1">

Above the women between Aithra and Nestor are other captive women,
<span class="mark">Klymenē</span>, Kreousa,
<span class="mark">Aristomakhē</span>, and
<span class="mark">Xenodikē</span>. Now Stesichorus, in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Sack of Troy</span>, includes
<span class="mark">Klymenē</span> in the number of the captives; and
similarly, in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Returns</span>, he
<span class="mark">speaks</span> \[*poieîn*\] of
<span class="mark">Aristomakhē</span> as the daughter of Priam and the
wife of Kritolaos, son of <span class="mark">Hiketaon</span>. But I know
of no <span class="mark">poet</span> \[*poiētēs*\], and of no prose
writer, who <span class="mark">makes mention</span> \[*mnēmoneuein*\] of
<span class="mark">Xenodikē</span>. About Kreousa, the story is told
that the mother of the gods and Aphrodite rescued her from slavery among
the Greeks, as she was, of course, the wife of Aeneas. But Lescheos and
the writer of the epic poem
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Cypria</span> make Eurydikē the wife
of Aeneas.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.2">

Beyond these are painted on a couch Deinome,
<span class="mark">Metiokhe</span>, Peisis, and Kleodike. Deinome is the
only one of these names to occur in what is called the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Little Iliad</span>; Polygnotus, I
think, invented the names of the others. Epeios is painted naked; he is
razing to the ground the Trojan wall. Above the wall rises the head only
of the Wooden Horse. There is <span class="mark">Polypoites</span>, the
son of <span class="mark">Peirithoos</span>, his head bound with a
<span class="mark">fillet</span> \[*tainiā*\]; by his side is Akamas,
the son of Theseus, wearing on his head a helmet with a crest on it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.3">

There is also Odysseus \[…\] and Odysseus has put on his corselet. Ajax,
the son of Oileus, holding a shield, stands by an
<span class="mark">altar</span> \[*bōmos*\], taking an oath about the
<span class="mark">outrage</span> \[*tolmēma*\] on Cassandra. Cassandra
is sitting on the ground, and holds the statue \[*agalma*\] of Athena,
for she had knocked over the carved-wooden-image \[*xoanon*\] from its
stand when Ajax was dragging her away from sanctuary. Also depicted
\[*graphein*\] are the sons of Atreus, wearing helmets like the others;
Menelaos carries a shield, on which is figured a serpent as a memorial
of the portent \[*teras*\] that appeared on the victims at Aulis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.4">

Under those who are administering the oath to Ajax, and in a line with
the horse by Nestor, is Neoptolemos, who has killed
<span class="mark">Elasos</span>, whoever
<span class="mark">Elasos</span> may be.
<span class="mark">Elasos</span> is
<span class="mark">represented</span> \[*eikazesthai*\] as a man only
just alive. <span class="mark">Astunoos</span>, who is also
<span class="mark">made</span> \[*poieîn*\] mention \[*mnēmē*\] by
Lescheos, has fallen to his knees, and Neoptolemos is striking him with
a sword. Neoptolemos is the only one of the Greek army represented
<span class="mark"></span>\[*poieîn*\] by Polygnotus as still killing
the Trojans, the reason being that he intended the whole painting
\[*graphē*\] to be placed over the tomb \[*taphos*\] of Neoptolemos. The
son of Achilles is named Neoptolemos by Homer in all his poetry
\[*poiēsis*\]. The epic poem, however, called
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Cypria</span> says that Lykomedes
named him Pyrrhos, but Phoenix gave him the name of Neoptolemos (young
warrior) because Achilles was but young when he first went to war.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.5">

In the picture is an altar \[*bōmos*\], to which a small boy clings in
terror. On the altar \[*bōmos*\] lies a bronze corselet. At the present
day, corselets of this form are rare, but they used to be worn in days
of old. They were made of two bronze pieces, one fitting the chest and
the parts about the belly, the other intended to protect the back. They
were called <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">gyala</span>. One
was put on in front, and the other behind; then they were fastened
together by buckles.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.6">

They were thought to afford sufficient safety even without a shield.
That is why Homer[^640] speaks of Phorkys the Phrygian as without a
shield, because he wore a two piece corselet. Not only have I seen this
armor depicted by Polygnotus, but in the temple of Ephesian Artemis,
Kalliphon of Samos has painted \[*graphein*\] women fitting on the gyala
of the corselet of Patroklos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.7">

Beyond the altar \[*bōmos*\] he has painted \[*graphein*\] Laodike
standing, whom I do not find among the Trojan captive women enumerated
\[*katalegein*\] by any poet, so I think that the only probable
conclusion is that she was set free by the Greeks. Homer in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> speaks of the
hospitality \[*xeniā*\] given to Menelaos and Odysseus by Antenor, and
how Laodike was wife to <span class="mark">Helikaon</span>, Antenor’s
son.[^641]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.8">

Lescheos says that Helikaon, wounded in the night battle, was recognized
by Odysseus and carried alive out of the fighting. So the tie binding
Menelaos and Odysseus to the house of Antenor makes it unlikely that
Agamemnon and Menelaos committed any spiteful act against the wife of
Hekikaon. The account of Laodikē given by the Chalcidian poet Euphorion
is entirely unlikely.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.26.9">

Next to Laodikē is a stone stand with a bronze washing basin upon it.
Medusa is sitting on the ground, holding the stand in both hands. If we
are to believe the ode of the poet of Himera, Medusa should be reckoned
as one of the daughters of Priam. Beside Medusa is a shaved old woman or
eunuch, holding on the knees a naked child. It is represented
\[*poieîn*\] as holding its hand before its eyes in terror.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.27.1">

There are also corpses: the naked man, Pelis by name, lies thrown on his
back, and under Pelis lie Eioneus and Admetos, still clad in their
corselets. Of these Lescheos says that Eioneus was killed by
Neoptolemos, and Admetos by Philoctetes. Above these are others: under
the washing-basin is Leokritos, the son of Poulydamas, killed by
Odysseus; beyond Eioneus and Admetos is
<span class="mark">Koroibos</span>, the son of Mygdon. Of Mygdon, there
is a notable <span class="mark">tomb</span> \[*mnēmē*\] on the borders
of the Phrygians of <span class="mark">Stektorion</span>, and after him,
poets are accustomed to call Phrygians by the name of Mygdones.
<span class="mark">Koroibos</span> came to marry Cassandra and was
killed, according to the more popular account by Neoptolemos, but
according to the poet Lescheos, by Diomedes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.27.2">

Higher up than <span class="mark">Koroibos</span> are Priam, Axion, and
Agenor. Lescheos says that Priam was not killed at the
<span class="mark">sacrificial-hearth of the Courtyard-god \[Herkeios =
Zeus\]</span>, but that he was dragged away from the
<span class="mark">altar</span> \[*bōmos*\] and fell an easy prey to
Neoptolemos at the gate of his own palace. As to Hecuba, Stesichorus
says \[*poieîn*\] in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Sack of
Troy</span> that she was brought by Apollo to Lycia. Lescheos says that
Axion was a son of Priam, killed by <span class="mark">Eurypylos</span>,
the son of <span class="mark">Euaimon</span>. According to the same
poet, Agenor was slain by Neoptolemos. So it would appear that Ekheklos
the son of Agenor was slaughtered by Achilles, and Agenor himself by
Neoptolemos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.27.3">

The body of Laomedon is being carried off by Sinon, a comrade of
Odysseus, and Ankhialos. There is also in the painting another corpse,
that of Eresos. The tale of Eresos and Laomedon, so far as we know, no
poet has sung. There is the house of Antenor, with a leopard’s skin
hanging over the entrance, as a sign to the Greeks to keep their hands
off the home of Antenor. There are painted Theano and her sons, Glaukos
sitting on a corselet fitted with the two pieces, and Eurymakhos upon a
rock.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.27.4">

By the latter stands Antenor, and next to him
<span class="mark">Krino</span>, a daughter of Antenor.
<span class="mark">Krino</span> is carrying a baby. The
<span class="mark">look</span> \[*skhēma*\] upon their faces is that of
those on whom a calamity has fallen. Servants are
<span class="mark">loading</span> an donkey with a chest and other
furniture. There is also sitting on the donkey a small child. At this
part of the <span class="mark">painting</span> \[*graphē*\], there is
also an elegiac couplet of Simonides:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Polygnotus, a Thasian by birth, son of Aglaophon,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Painted a picture of Troy’s citadel being sacked.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

Simonides, unknown location.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.1">

The other part of the picture, the one on the left, shows Odysseus, who
has descended into what is called Hades to inquire of the soul of
Teiresias about his safe return home. The objects depicted are as
follow. There is water like a river, clearly intended for Acheron, with
reeds growing in it; the forms of the fishes appear so dim that you will
take them to be shadows rather than fish. On the river is a boat, with
the ferryman at the oars.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.2">

Polygnotus followed, I think, the poem called the Minyad. For in this
poem occur lines referring to Theseus and Peirithoös:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Then the boat on which embark the dead, that the old ferryman, Kharon,
used to steer, they found not within its moorings.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

The Minyad, an unknown work.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

For this reason then, Polygnotus too painted Kharon as a man well
stricken in years.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.3">

Those on board the boat are not altogether distinguished. Tellis appears
as a youth in years, and Kleoboia as still a maiden, holding on her
knees a chest such as they are accustomed to make for Demeter. All I
heard about Tellis was that Archilochus the poet was his grandson, while
as for Kleoboia, they say that she was the first to bring the orgies of
Demeter to Thasos from Paros.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.4">

On the bank of Acheron, there is a notable group under the boat of
Kharon, consisting of a man who had been undutiful to his father and is
now being throttled by him. For the men of old held their parents in the
greatest respect, as we may infer, among other instances, from those in
Catana called the Pious, who, when the fire flowed down on Catana from
Aetna, held of no account gold or silver, but when they fled took up,
one his mother and another his father. As they struggled on, the fire
rushed up and caught them in the flames. Not even so would they put down
their parents, and it is said that the stream of lava divided itself in
two, and the fire passed on, doing no hurt to either young men or their
parents. These Catanians even at the present day receive honors from
their fellow countrymen.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.5">

Near to the man in Polygnotus’ picture who maltreated his father and for
this drinks his cup of woe in Hades, is a man who paid the penalty for
sacrilege. The woman who is punishing him is skilled in poisonous and
other drugs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.6">

So it appears that in those days men laid the greatest stress on piety
to the gods, as the Athenians showed when they took the sanctuary of
Olympian Zeus at Syracuse; they moved none of the offerings but left the
Syracusan priest as their keeper. Datis the Persian too showed his piety
in his address to the Delians, and in this act as well, when having
found an image of Apollo in a Phoenician ship, he restored it to the
Tanagraeans at Delium. So at that time all men held the divine in
reverence, and this is why Polygnotus has depicted the punishment of him
who committed sacrilege.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.7">

Higher up than the figures I have enumerated comes Eurynomos, said by
the Delphian guides to be one of the demons in Hades, who eats off all
the flesh of the corpses, leaving only their bones. But Homer’s
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>, the poem called the
Minyad, and the Returns, although they tell of Hades and its horrors,
know of no demon called Eurynomos. However, I will describe what he is
like and his attitude in the painting. He is of a color between blue and
black, like that of meat flies; he is showing his teeth and is seated,
and under him is spread a vulture’s skin.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.28.8">

Next after Eurynomos are Auge of Arcadia and Iphimedeia. Auge visited
the house of Teuthras in Mysia, and of all the women with whom Hēraklēs
is said to have mated, none gave birth to a son more like his father
than she did. Great honors are paid to Iphimedeia by the Carians in
Mylasa.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.1">

Higher up than the figures I have already enumerated are Perimedes and
Eurylokhos, the companions of Odysseus, carrying victims for sacrifice;
these are black rams. After them is a man seated, said by the
inscription to be Ocnus (Sloth). He is depicted as plaiting a cord, and
by him stands a she-donkey, eating up the cord as quickly as it is
plaited. They say that this Ocnus was a diligent man with an extravagant
wife. Everything he earned by working was quickly spent by his wife.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.2">

So they will have it that Polygnotus has painted a parable about the
wife of Ocnus. I know also that the Ionians, whenever they see a man
laboring at nothing profitable, say that such a figure is plaiting the
cord of Ocnus. Ocnus too is the name given to a bird by the seers who
observe birds that are ominous. This Ocnus is the largest and most
beautiful of the herons, a rare bird if ever there was one.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.3">

Tityos too is in the picture; he is no longer being punished but has
been reduced to nothing by continuous torture, an indistinct and
mutilated phantom.

</div>

Going on to the next part of the picture, you see very near to the man
who is twisting the rope a painting of Ariadne. Seated on a rock, she is
looking at her sister Phaedra, who is on a swing grasping in either hand
the rope on each side. The attitude, though quite gracefully drawn,
makes us infer the manner of Phaedra’s death.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.4">

Ariadne was taken away from Theseus by Dionysus, who sailed against him
with superior forces, and either fell in with Ariadne by chance or else
set an ambush to catch her. This Dionysus was, in my opinion, none other
than he who was the first to invade India and the first to bridge the
river Euphrates. Zeugma (Bridge) was the name given to that part of the
country where the Euphrates was bridged, and at the present day, the
cable is still preserved with which he spanned the river; it is plaited
with branches of the vine and ivy.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.5">

There are many things-said
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">legomena</span>\] by the
Greeks and the Egyptians about Dionysus. Underneath Phaedra is Chloris
leaning against the knees of Thyia. He will not be mistaken who says
that all during the lives of these women they remained friends. For
Chloris came from Orkhomenos in Boeotia, and the other was a daughter of
Kastalios from Parnassus. Other authorities have told their history, how
Thyia had connection with Poseidon, and how Chloris wedded Neleus, son
of Poseidon.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.6">

Beside Thyia stands Procris, the daughter of Erekhtheus, and after her
Clymene, who is turning her back to Chloris. The poem the Returns says
that Clymene was a daughter of Minyas, that she married Cephalus the son
of Deion, and that a son Iphiklos was born to them. The story of Procris
is told by all men, how she had married Cephalus before Clymene, and in
what way she was put to death by her husband.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.7">

Farther within from Clymene, you will see Megara from Thebes. This
Megara married Hēraklēs but was divorced by him in course of time on the
ground that he had lost the children he had by her and so thought that
his marriage with her was unlucky.

</div>

Above the heads of the women I have enumerated is the daughter of
Salmoneus sitting on a rock, beside whom is standing Eriphyle, who is
holding up the ends of her fingers along her neck through her tunic, and
you will conjecture that in the folds of her tunic, she is holding in
one of her hands the famous necklace.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.8">

Beyond Eriphyle have been painted Elpenor and Odysseus. The latter is
squatting on his feet, and holding his sword over the trench, towards
which the seer Teiresias is advancing. After Teiresias is Anticleia, the
mother of Odysseus, upon a rock. Elpenor has on instead of clothes a
mat, such as is usual for sailors to wear.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.9">

Lower down than Odysseus are Theseus and Peirithoös sitting upon chairs.
The former is holding in his hands the sword of Peirithoös and his own.
Peirithoös is looking at the swords, and you might conjecture that he is
angry with them for having been useless and of no help in their daring
adventures. Panyassis the poet says that Theseus and Peirithoös did not
sit chained to their chairs but that the rock grew to their flesh and so
served as chains.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.29.10">

The proverbial friendship of Theseus and Peirithoös has been mentioned
by Homer in both his poems. In the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>, Odysseus says to the
Phaeacians:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And now I should have seen more men of former days, whom I wished very
much to see,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Theseus and Peirithoös, renowned children of gods.

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> 11.631–632

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

And in the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad,</span> he has made
Nestor give advice to Agamemnon and Achilles, and speaking among others
the following verses:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

I have never yet seen such men, and I am never likely to see

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

As were Peirithoös, Dryas, shepherd of the folk,

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.1">

Next Polygnotus has painted the daughters of Pandareos. Homer makes
Penelope say in a speech[^642] that the parents of the girls died
because of the wrath of the gods, that they were reared as orphans by
Aphrodite and received gifts from other goddesses: from Hērā, wisdom and
beauty of form; from Artemis, high stature; from Athena, schooling in
the works that befit women.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.2">

He goes on to say that Aphrodite ascended into the sky
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ouranos</span>\], wishing to
secure for the girls a happy marriage, and in her absence, they were
carried off by the Harpies and given by them to the Furies. This is the
story as given by Homer. Polygnotus has painted them as girls garlanded
with flowers and playing with dice and gives them the names of Cameiro
and Clytie. I must tell you that Pandareos was a Milesian from Miletus
in Crete and implicated in the theft of Tantalos and in the trick of the
oath.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.3">

After the daughters of Pandareos is Antilokhos, with one foot upon a
rock and his face and head resting upon both hands, while after
Antilokhos is Agamemnon, leaning on a scepter beneath his left armpit,
and holding up a staff in his hands. Protesilaos is seated with his gaze
fixed on Achilles. Such is the posture of Protesilaos, and beyond
Achilles is Patroklos standing. With the exception of Agamemnon, these
figures have no beard.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.4">

Beyond them has been painted Phokos as a youth, and Iaseus, well
bearded, is taking off a ring from the left hand of Phokos. The story
about this is as follows. When Phokos, the son of Aiakos, had crossed
from Aegina into what is now called Phokis and wished to gain the rule
over the men living on that part of the mainland and to settle there
himself, Iaseus conceived a great friendship for him. Among the gifts
that Iaseus gave (as friends will) was a seal ring, a stone set in gold.
But when Phokos returned, not long afterwards, to Aegina, Peleus at once
plotted to kill him. This is the reason why in the painting, as a
reminder of their great friendship, Iaseus is anxious to look at the
ring, and Phokos has let him take it.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.5">

Beyond these is Maera sitting on a rock. About her, the poem Returns
says that she was still a maid when she departed this life, being the
daughter of Proitos, son of Thersandros, who was a son of Sisyphus. Next
to Maera is Actaeon, son of Aristaios, together with the mother of
Actaeon; they hold in their hands a young deer and are sitting on a
deer’s skin. A hunting dog lies stretched out beside them, an allusion
to Actaeon’s mode of life, and to the manner of his death.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.6">

Turning our gaze again to the lower part of the picture we see, next
after Patroklos, Orpheus sitting on what seems to be a sort of hill; he
grasps with his left hand a harp, and with his right, he touches a
willow. It is the branches that he touches, and he is leaning against
the tree. The grove seems to be that of Persephone, where grow, as Homer
thought,[^643] black poplars and willows. The appearance of Orpheus is
Greek, and neither his garb nor his headgear is Thracian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.7">

On the other side of the willow tree Promedon is leaning against it.
Some there are who think that the name Promedon is as it were a poetic
invention of Polygnotus; others have said that Promedon was a Greek who
was fond of listening to all kinds of music, especially to the singing
of Orpheus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.8">

In this part of the painting is Schedios, who led the men of Phokis to
Troy, and after him is Pelias, sitting on a chair, with grey hair and
grey beard, and looking at Orpheus. Schedios holds a dagger and is
garlanded with grass. Thamyris is sitting near Pelias. He has lost the
sight of his eyes; his attitude is one of utter dejection; his hair and
beard are long; at his feet lies thrown a lyre with its horns and
strings broken.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.30.9">

Above him is Marsyas, sitting on a rock, and by his side is Olympus,
with the appearance of a boy in the bloom of youth learning to play the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\].
The Phrygians in Kelainai hold that the river passing through the city
was once this great <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span>
player, and they also hold that the Song of the Mother, an air for the
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\],
was composed by Marsyas. They say too that they repelled the army of the
Gauls by the aid of Marsyas, who defended them against the barbarians by
the water from the river and by the music of his
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">aulos</span> \[‘double-reed’\].

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.1">

If you turn your gaze again to the upper part of the painting, you see,
next to Actaeon, Ajax of Salamis, and also Palamedes and Thersites
playing with dice, the invention of Palamedes; the other Ajax is looking
at them as they play. The color of the latter Ajax is like that of a
shipwrecked sailor with the brine still rough on the surface of his
skin.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.2">

Polygnotus has intentionally gathered into one group the enemies of
Odysseus. Ajax, son of Oileus, conceived a hatred of Odysseus, because
Odysseus urged the Greeks to stone him for the outrage on Cassandra.
Palamedes, as I know from reading the epic poem Cypria, was drowned when
he put out to catch fish, and his murderers were Diomedes and Odysseus.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.3">

Meleagros, the son of Oineus, is higher up in the picture than Ajax, the
son of Oileus, and he seems to be looking at Ajax. Palamedes has no
beard, but the others have. As to the death of Meleagros, Homer[^644]
says that the Fury heard the curses of Althaea and that this was the
cause of the death of Meleagros. But the poem Eoeae, as it is called,
and the Minyad agree in giving a different account. For these poems say
that Apollo helped the Kouretes against the Aetolians and that Meleagros
was killed by Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.4">

The story about the brand, how it was given by the Fates to Althaea, how
Meleagros was not to die before the brand was consumed by fire, and how
Althaea burned it up in a passion—this story was first made the subject
of a drama by Phrynichus, the son of Polyphradmon, in his
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Pleuronian Women</span>:

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_blockquote">

For chill doom he escaped not, but a swift flame consumed him, as the
brand was destroyed by his terrible mother, contriver of evil.

However, it appears that Phrynichus did not elaborate the story as a man
would his own invention but only touched on it as one already in the
mouths of everybody in Greece.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.5">

In the lower part of the picture, after the Thracian Thamyris, comes
Hector, who is sitting with both hands clasped about his left knee, in
an attitude of deep grief. After him is Memnon, sitting on a rock, and
Sarpedon next to Memnon. Sarpedon has his face buried in both hands, and
one of Memnon’s hands lies on Sarpedon’s shoulder.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.6">

All are bearded; and on the cloak of Memnon are embroidered birds. Their
name is Memnonides, and the people of the Hellespont say that on stated
days every year they go to the tomb of Memnon and sweep all that part of
the tomb that is bare of trees or grass and sprinkle it with the water
of the Aisepos from their wet wings.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.7">

Beside Memnon is depicted a naked Ethiopian boy, because Memnon was king
of the Ethiopian nation. He came to Troy, however, not from Ethiopia,
but from Susa in-Persia
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persika</span>\]and from the
river Choaspes, having subdued all the peoples that lived between these
and Troy. The Phrygians still point out the road through which he led
his army, picking out the shortest routes. The road is divided up by
halting places.[^645]

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.8">

Beyond Sarpedon and Memnon is Paris, as yet beardless. He is clapping
his hands like a boor, and you will say that it is as though Paris were
calling Penthesileia to him by the noise of his hands. Penthesileia too
is there, looking at Paris, but by the toss of her head, she seems to
show her disdain and contempt. In appearance, Penthesileia is a maiden,
carrying a bow like Scythian bows, and wearing a leopard’s skin on her
shoulders.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.9">

The women beyond Penthesileia are carrying water in broken pitchers; one
is depicted as in the bloom of youth, the other is already advanced in
years. There is no separate inscription on either woman, but there is
one common to the pair, which states that they are of the number of the
uninitiated.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.10">

Higher up than these is Kallisto, daughter of Lykaon, Nomia, and Pero,
daughter of Neleus. As her bride price, Neleus asked for the oxen of
Iphiklos. Instead of a mattress, Kallisto has a bearskin, and her feet
are lying on Nomia’s knees. I have already mentioned that the Arcadians
say that Nomia[^646] is a nymph native to their country. The poets say
that the nymphs live for a great number of years but are not altogether
exempt from death.

</div>

After Kallisto and the women with her is the form of a cliff, and
Sisyphus, the son of Aeolus, is trying his hardest to push the rock up
it.

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.31.11">

There is also in the painting a jar and an old man with a boy and two
women. One of these, who is young, is under the rock; the other is
beside the old man and of a like age to his. The others are carrying
water, but you will guess that the old woman’s water jar is broken. All
that remains of the water in the sherd, she is pouring out again into
the jar. We inferred that these people too were of those who had held of
no account the rites at Eleusis. For the Greeks of an earlier period
looked upon the Eleusinian mysteries as being as much higher than all
other religious acts as gods are higher than heroes.

</div>

Under this jar is Tantalos, enduring all the pains that Homer[^647]
speaks of, and in addition, the terror of the stone that hangs over him.
Polygnotus has plainly followed the account of Archilochus, but I do not
know whether Archilochus borrowed from others the story of the stone or
whether it was an invention of his that he introduced into his poem.

So great is the number of the figures and so many are their beauties in

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">THEATRE AT DELPHI</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.1">

Adjoining the sacred enclosure is a theater worth seeing, and on coming
up from the enclosure \[…\] and here is an image of Dionysus, dedicated
by the people of Knidos. The Delphian race course is on the highest part
of their city. It was made of the stone that is most common about
Parnassus until Herodes the Athenian rebuilt it of Pentelic marble. Such
in my day the objects remaining in Delphi that are worth recording.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">THE CORYCIAN CAVE</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.2">

On the way from Delphi to the summit of Parnassus, about sixty
stadium-lengths distant from Delphi, there is a bronze image. The ascent
to the Corycian cave is easier for an active walker than it is for mules
or horses. I mentioned a little earlier in my narrative[^648] that this
cave was named after a nymph called Corycia, and of all the caves I have
ever seen, this seemed to me the best worth seeing.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.3">

It would be impossible to discover even the mere number of caves whose
entrances face the beach or the deep sea, but the most famous ones in
Greek or in barbarian lands are the following. The Phrygians on the
river Pencelas, and those who came to this land originally from the
Azanians in Arcadia, show visitors a cave called Steunos, which is round
and handsome in its loftiness. It is sacred to the Mother, and there is
an image of her.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.4">

Themisonium above Laodiceia is also inhabited by Phrygians. When the
army of the Gauls was laying waste Ionia and the borders of Ionia, the
Themisonians say that they were helped by Hēraklēs, Apollo, and Hermes,
who revealed to their magistrates in dreams a cave and commanded that in
it should be hidden the Themisonians with their wives and children.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.5">

This is the reason why in front of the cave they have set up small
images, called Gods of the Cave, of Hēraklēs, Hermes, and Apollo. The
cave is some thirty stadium-lengths distant from the city and in it are
springs of water. There is no entrance to it; the sunlight does not
reach very far, and the greater part of the roof lies quite close to the
floor.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.6">

There is also near Magnesia on the river Lethaios a place called Aulai
(Halls), where there is a cave sacred to Apollo, not very remarkable for
its size, but the image of Apollo is very old indeed, and bestows
strength equal to any task. The men sacred to the god leap down from
sheer precipices and high rocks, and uprooting trees of exceeding height
walk with their burdens down the narrowest of paths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.7">

But the Corycian cave exceeds in size those I have mentioned, and it is
possible to make one’s way through the greater part of it even without
lights. The roof stands at a sufficient height from the floor, and
water, rising in part from springs but still more dripping from the
roof, has made clearly visible the marks of drops on the floor
throughout the cave. The dwellers around Parnassus believe it to be
sacred to the Corycian nymphs and especially to Pan. From the Corycian
cave, it is difficult even for an active walker to reach the heights of
Parnassus. The heights are above the clouds, and the Thyiad women rave
there in honor of Dionysus and Apollo.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">TITHOREA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.8">

Tithorea is, I should guess, about one hundred and eighty
stadium-lengths distant from Delphi on the road across Parnassus. This
road is not mountainous throughout, being fit even for vehicles but was
said to be several stadium-lengths longer. I am aware that
Herodotus[^649] in his account of the Persian invasion gives the town a
different name from that given to it in the oracles of Bacis.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.9">

For Bacis called the inhabitants Tithoreans, but the account of them in
Herodotus states that during the advance of the barbarians, the people
dwelling here fled up to the summit and that the city’s name was Neon,
Tithorea being the name of the peak of Parnassus. It appears then that
at first Tithorea was the name applied to the whole district; but in
course of time, when the people migrated from the villages, the city too
came to be called Tithorea, and not Neon any longer. The natives say
that Tithorea was so called after a nymph of the same name, one of those
who in days of old, according to the story of the poets, grew out of
trees and especially out of oaks.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.10">

One generation before I was born, the superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] made the
fortunes of Tithorea decay. There are the buildings of a theater, and
the enclosure of a rather ancient marketplace. The most noteworthy
objects in the city are the grove, temple, and image of Athena. There is
also the tomb of Antiope and Phokos. I have already in my account of
Thebes mentioned[^650] how Antiope went mad because of the wrath of
Dionysus, and the reason why she brought on herself the anger of the
god;

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.11">

I have also told how Phokos, the son of Ornytion, fell in love with her,
how she married him and is buried with him, and what Bacis the
soothsayer says about this tomb in common with that of Zethus and
Amphion at Thebes. I found nothing else remarkable in the town except
what I have already mentioned. Running past the city of Tithorea is a
river that gives the inhabitants drinking water. They go down to the
bank and draw the water up. The name of the river is Cachales.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">NEAR TITHOREA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.12">

Seventy stadium-lengths distant from Tithorea is a temple of Asklepios
called Arkhagetas (Founder). He receives divine honors from the
Tithoreans and no less from the other people of Phokis. Within the
precincts are dwellings for both the suppliants of the god and his
servants. In the middle is the temple of the god and an image made of
stone, having a beard more than two feet long. A couch is set on the
right of the image. It is usual to sacrifice to the god any animal
except the goat.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.13">

About forty stadium-lengths distant from Asklepios is a precinct and
shrine sacred to Isis, the holiest of all those made by the Greeks for
the Egyptian goddess. For the Tithoreans think it wrong to dwell round
about it, and no one may enter the shrine except those whom Isis herself
has honored by inviting them in dreams. The same rule is observed in the
cities above the Maeander by the gods of the lower world; for to all
whom they wish to enter their shrines they send visions seen in dreams.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.14">

In the country of the Tithoreans, a festival in honor of Isis is held
twice each year, one in spring and the other in autumn. On the third
day, before each of the feasts, those who have permission to enter
purify the shrine in a certain secret way and also take and bury, always
in the same spot, whatever remnants they may find of the victims thrown
in at the previous festival. We estimated that the distance from the
shrine to this place was two stadium-lengths.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.15">

So on this day, they perform these acts about the sanctuary, and on the
next day, the small traders make themselves booths of reeds or other
improvised material. On the last of the three days, they hold a fair,
selling slaves, cattle of all kinds, clothes, silver, and gold.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.16">

After midday, they turn to sacrificing. The more wealthy sacrifice oxen
and deer, the poorer people geese and guinea fowl. But it is not the
custom to use for the sacrifice sheep, pigs, or goats. Those whose
business it is to burn the victims[^651] and send them into the shrine
\[…\] having made a beginning must wrap the victims in bandages of
coarse or fine linen; the mode of preparing is the Egyptian.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.17">

All that they have devoted to sacrifice are led in procession; some send
the victims into the shrine, while others burn the booths before the
shrine and themselves go away in haste. They say that once a profane
man, who was not one of those descending into the shrine, when the pyre
began to burn, entered the shrine to satisfy his rash inquisitiveness.
It is said that everywhere he saw ghosts, and on returning to Tithorea
and telling what he had seen, he departed this life.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.18">

I have heard a similar story from a man of Phoenicia, that the Egyptians
hold the feast for Isis at a time when they say she is mourning for
Osiris. At this time the Nile begins to rise, and it is a saying among
many of the natives that what makes the river rise and water their
fields is the tears of Isis. At that time then, so said my Phoenician,
the Roman governor of Egypt bribed a man to go down into the shrine of
Isis in Coptus. The man dispatched into the shrine returned indeed out
of it, but after relating what he had seen, he too, so I was told, died
immediately. So it appears that Homer’s verse[^652] speaks the truth
when it says that it bodes no good to man to see godhead face to face.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.32.19">

The olive oil of Tithorea is less abundant than Attic or Sikyonian oil,
but in color and pleasantness, it surpasses Iberian oil and that from
the island of Istria. They distill all manner of unguents from the oil
and also send it to the Emperor.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">LEDON</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.1">

Another road from Tithorea is the one that leads to Ledon. Once Ledon
also was considered a city, but in my day, the Ledontians owing to their
weakness, had abandoned the city, and the dwellers on the Kephisos were
about seventy people. Still, the name of Ledon is given to their
dwellings, and the citizens, like the Panopeans, have the right to be
represented at the general assembly of the people of Phokis. The ruins
of the ancient Ledon are forty stadium-lengths farther up from these
dwellers on the Kephisos. They say that the city took its name from an
aborigine.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.2">

Other cities have incurred incurable harm through the sin of their own
citizens, but Troy’s ruin was complete when it fell through the outrage
that Alexander committed against Menelaos, and Miletus through the lack
of control shown by Histiaios, and his passionate desire, now to possess
the city in the land of the Edonians, now to be admitted to the councils
of Dareios, and now to go back to Ionia. Again, Philomēlos brought on
the community of Ledon the punishment to be paid for the crime of his
own impiety.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">LILAEA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.3">

Lilaea is a winter day’s journey distant from Delphi; we estimated the
length of the road, which goes across and down Parnassus, to be one
hundred and eighty stadium-lengths. Even after their city had been
restored, its inhabitants were fated to suffer a second disaster at the
hands of the Macedonians. Besieged by Philip, the son of Demetrios, they
made terms and surrendered, and a garrison was brought into the city,
until a native of the city, whose name was Patron, united against the
garrison those of the citizens who were of military age conquered the
Macedonians in battle and forced them to withdraw under a truce. In
return for this good deed, the Lilaeans dedicated his statue at Delphi.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.4">

In Lilaea are also a theater, a marketplace, and baths. There is also a
sanctuary of Apollo, and one of Artemis. The images are standing, of
Attic workmanship, and of marble from the Pentelic quarries. They say
that Lilaea was one of the Naids, as they are called, a daughter of the
Kephisos, and that after this nymph the city was named. Here the river
has its source.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.5">

It is not always quiet when it rises from the ground, but it usually
happens that at about midday, it makes a noise as it wells up. You could
compare the roar of the water to the bellowing of a bull. Lilaea has a
temperate climate in autumn, in summer, and in spring; but Mount
Parnassus prevents the winter from being correspondingly mild.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">CHARADRA & PARAPOTAMII</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.6">

Kharadra is twenty stadium-lengths distant, situated on the top of a
lofty crag. The inhabitants are badly off for water; their drinking
water is the river Kharadros, and they have to go down about three
stadium-lengths to reach it. This river is a tributary of the Kephisos,
and it seems to me that the town was named after the Kharadros. In the
marketplace at Kharadra are altars of Heroes, as they are called, said
by some to be the Dioskouroi, by others to be local heroes.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.7">

The land beside the Kephisos is distinctly the best in Phokis for
planting, sowing and pasture. This part of the district, too, is the one
most under cultivation, so that there is a saying that the verse,

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

And they who dwelled beside the divine river Kephisos

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_source_attrib">

alludes, not to a city Parapotamii (Riverside), but to the farmers
beside the Kephisos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.8">

The saying, however, is at variance with the history of Herodotus[^653]
as well as with the records of victories at the Pythian Games. For the
Pythian Games were first held by the Amphiktyones, and at this first
meeting a Parapotamian of the name of Aechmeas won the prize in the
boxing match for boys. Similarly Herodotus, enumerating the cities that
King Xerxes burned in Phokis, includes among them the city of
Parapotamii. However, Parapotamii was not restored by the Athenians and
Boeotians, but the inhabitants, being poverty stricken and few in
number, were distributed among the other cities. I found no ruins of
Parapotamii left, nor is the site of the city remembered.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">AMPHICLEIA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.9">

The road from Lilaea to Amphicleia is sixty stadium-lengths. The name of
this Amphicleia has been corrupted by the native inhabitants. Herodotus,
following the most ancient account, called it Amphicaea; but the
Amphiktyones, when they published their decree for the destruction of
the cities in Phokis, gave it the name of Amphicleia. The natives tell
about it the following story. A certain chief, suspecting that enemies
were plotting against his baby son, put the child in a vessel, and hid
him in that part of the land where he knew there would be most security.
Now a wolf attacked the child, but a serpent coiled itself round the
vessel, and kept up a strict watch.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.10">

When the child’s father came, supposing that the serpent had purposed to
attack the child, he threw his javelin, which killed the serpent and his
son as well. But being informed by the shepherds that he had killed the
benefactor and protector of his child, he made one common pyre for both
the serpent and his son. Now they say that even today the place
resembles a burning pyre, maintaining that after this serpent the city
was called Ophiteia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.11">

They celebrate orgies, well worth seeing, in honor of Dionysus, but
there is no entrance to the shrine, nor have they any image that can be
seen. The people of Amphicleia say that this god is their prophet and
their helper in disease. The diseases of the Amphicleans themselves and
of their neighbors are cured by means of dreams. The oracles of the god
are given by the priest, who utters them when under the divine
inspiration.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">DRYMAEA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.33.12">

Fifteen stadium-lengths away from Amphicleia is Tithronium, lying on a
plain. It contains nothing remarkable. From Tithronium it is twenty
stadium-lengths to Drymaea. At the place where this road joins at the
Kephisos the straight road from Amphicleia to Drymaea,[^654] the
Tithronians have a grove and altars of Apollo. There has also been made
a temple, but no image.

</div>

Drymaea is eighty stadium-lengths distant from Amphicleia, on the left …
according to the account in Herodotus,[^655] but in earlier days
Naubolenses. The inhabitants say that their founder was Naubolus, son of
Phokos, son of Aiakos. At Drymaea is an ancient sanctuary of Demeter
Lawgiver, with a standing image made of stone. Every year they hold a
feast in her honor, the Thesmophoria.

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">ELATEIA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.1">

Elateia is, with the exception of Delphi, the largest city in Phokis. It
lies over against Amphicleia, and the road to it from Amphicleia is one
hundred and eighty stadium-lengths long, level for the most part, but
with an upward gradient for a short distance quite close to the town of
Elateia. In the plain flows the Kephisos, and the most common bird to
live along its banks is the bustard.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.2">

The people of Elateia were successful in repelling the Macedonian army
under Kassandros, and they managed to escape from the war that Taxilos,
general of Mithridates, brought against them. In return for this deed
the Romans have given them the privilege of living in the country free
and immune from taxation. They claim to be of foreign stock, saying that
of old they came from Arcadia. For they say that when the Phlegyans
marched against the sanctuary at Delphi, Elatos, the son of Arkas, came
to the assistance of the god, and with his army stayed behind in Phokis,
becoming the founder of Elateia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.3">

Elateia must be numbered among the cities of the people of Phokis burned
by the Persians. Some disasters were shared by Elateia with the other
people of Phokis, but she had peculiar calamities of her own, inflicted
by fate at the hands of the Macedonians. In the war waged by Kassandros,
it is Olympiodoros who must receive most credit for the Macedonians
being forced to abandon a siege. Philip, the son of Demetrios, reduced
the people of Elateia to the utmost terror, and at the same time seduced
by bribery the more powerful of the citizens.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.4">

Titus, the Roman governor, who had a commission from Rome to give all
Greeks their freedom, promised to give back to Elateia its ancient
constitution, and by messengers made overtures to its citizens to secede
from Macedonia. But either they or their government were stupid enough
to be faithful to Philip, and the Romans reduced them by siege. Later on
the people of Elateia held out when besieged by the barbarians of Pontos
under the command of Taxilos, the general of Mithridates. As a reward
for this deed the Romans gave them their freedom.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.5">

An army of bandits, called the Kostoboes, who overran Greece in my day,
visited among other cities Elateia. Whereupon a certain Mnesiboulos
gathered round him a company of men and put to the sword many of the
barbarians, but he himself fell in the fighting. This Mnesiboulos won
several prizes for running, among which were prizes for the foot-race,
and for the double race with shield, at the two hundred and thirty-fifth
Olympic festival.[^656] In Runner Street at Elateia there stands a
bronze statue of Mnesiboulos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.6">

The marketplace itself is worth seeing, and so is the figure of Elatos
carved in relief upon a slab. I do not know for certain whether they
made the slab to honor him as their founder or merely to serve as a
tombstone to his tomb. A temple has been built to Asklepios, with a
bearded image of the god. The names of the makers of the image are
Timokles and Timarchides, artists of Attic birth. At the end of the city
on the right is a theater, and an ancient bronze image of Athena. They
say that this goddess helped them against the barbarians under Taxilos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.7">

About twenty stadium-lengths away from Elateia is a sanctuary of Athena
surnamed Cranaea. The road to it slopes upwards, but so gentle is the
ascent that it causes no fatigue—in fact one scarcely notices it. At the
end of the road is a hill which, though for the most part precipitous,
is neither very large nor very high. On this hill the sanctuary has been
built, with porticoes and dwellings through them, where live those whose
duty it is to wait on the god, chief of whom is the priest.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.34.8">

They choose the priest from boys who have not yet reached the age of
puberty, taking care beforehand that his term of office shall run out
before puberty arrives. The office lasts for five successive years,
during which the priest boards with the goddess, and bathes in tubs
after the ancient manner. This image too was made by the sons of
Polykles. It is armed as for battle, and on the shield is worked in
relief a copy of what in Athens is worked on the shield of her whom the
Athenians call the Virgin.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">ABAE</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.1">

To reach Abaiand Hyampolis from Elateia you may go along a mountain road
on the right of the city of Elateia, but the highway from Orkhomenos to
Opus also leads to those cities. If then you go along the road from
Orkhomenos to Opus, and turn off a little to the left, you reach the
road to Abae. The people of Abaisay that they came to Phokis from Argos,
and that the city got its name from Abas, the founder, who was a son of
Lynkeus and of Hypermnestra, the daughter of Danails. Abaifrom of old
has been considered sacred to Apollo, and here too there was an oracle
of that god.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.2">

The treatment that the god at Abai received at the hands of the Persian
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Persēs</span>\] was very
different from the honor paid him by the Romans. For while the Romans
have given freedom of government to Abai because of their reverence for
Apollo, the army of Xerxes burned down, as it did others, the sanctuary
at Abai. The Greeks who opposed the barbarians resolved not to rebuild
the sanctuaries burned down by them, but to leave them for all time as
memorials of their hatred. This too is the reason why the temples in the
territory of Haliartos, as well as the Athenian temples of Hērā on the
road to Phaleron and of Demeter at Phaleron, still remain half-burned
even at the present day.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.3">

Such, I suppose, was the appearance of the sanctuary at Abai also, after
the Persian invasion, until in the war of the people of Phokis some of
their men, overcome in battle, took refuge in Abae. Whereupon the
Thebans gave them to the flames, and with the refugees the sanctuary,
which was thus burned down a second time. However, it still stood even
in my time, the frailest of buildings ever damaged by fire, seeing that
the ruin begun by the Persian incendiaries was completed by the
incendiaries of Boeotia.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.4">

Beside the large temple there is another, but smaller in size, made for
Apollo by ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] Hadrian. The
images are of earlier date, being dedicated by the Abaeans themselves;
they are made of bronze, and all alike are standing, Apollo, Leto and
Artemis. At Abai there is a theater, and also a marketplace, both of
ancient construction.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">HYAMPOLIS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.5">

Returning to the straight road to Opus, you come next to Hyampolis. Its
mere name tells you who the inhabitants originally were, and the place
from which they were expelled when they came to this land. For it was
the Hyantes of Thebes who came here when they fled from Kadmos and his
army. In earlier times the city was called by its neighbors the city of
the Hyantes, but in course of time the name of Hyampolis prevailed over
the other.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.6">

Although Xerxes had burned down the city, and afterwards Philip had
razed it to the ground, nevertheless there were left the structure of an
old marketplace, a council-chamber (a building of no great size) and a
theater not far from the gates. ‘King’
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\]Hadrian built
a portico which bears the name of the king
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">basileus</span>\] who
dedicated it. The citizens have one well only. This is their sole
supply, both for drinking and for washing; from no other source can they
get water, save only from the winter rains.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.7">

Above all other divinities they worship Artemis, of whom they have a
temple. The image of her I cannot describe, for their rule is to open
the sanctuary twice, and not more often, every year. They say that
whatever cattle they consecrate to Artemis grow up immune to disease and
fatter than other cattle.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">STIRIS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.8">

The straight road to Delphi that leads through Panopeus and past Daulis
and the Cleft Way, is not the only pass from Khaironeia to Phokis. There
is another road, rough and for the most part mountainous, that leads
from Khairōneia to the city of Stiris in Phokis. The length of the road
is one hundred and twenty stadium-lengths. The inhabitants assert that
by descent they are from Phokis, but from Athens, and that they came
from Attica with Peteοs, the son of Orneus, when he was pursued from
Athens by Aigeus. They add that, because the greater part of those who
accompanied Peteοs came from the district
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">dēmos</span>\] known as
Stireis, the city received the name of Stiris.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.9">

The people of Stiris have their dwellings on a high and rocky site. For
this reason they suffer from a shortage of water in summer; the wells
are few, and the water is bad that they supply. These wells give
washing-water to the people and drinking-water to the beasts of burden,
but for their own drinking water the people go down about four
stadium-lengths and draw it from a spring. The spring is in a hole dug
into the rocks, and they go down to it to fetch water.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.35.10">

In Stiris is a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Stiria. It is of unburned
brick; the image is of Pentelic marble, and the goddess is holding
torches. Beside her, bound[^657] with ribbons, is an image of Demeter,
as ancient as any of that goddess that exists.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">AMBROSSOS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.1">

From Stiris to Ambrossos is about six stadium-lengths. The road is flat,
lying on the level with mountains on both sides of it. The greater part
of the plain is covered with vines, and in the territory of Ambrossos
grow shrubs, though not close together like the vines. This shrub the
Ionians, as well as the rest of the Greeks, call
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">kokkos</span>, and the Gauls
above Phrygia call it in their native speech
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hys</span>. This kokkos grows to
the size of what is called the rhamnos; the leaves are darker and softer
than those of the mastich tree, though in other respects the two are
alike.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.2">

Its fruit is like the fruit of the nightshade, and its size is about
that of the bitter vetch. There breeds in the fruit of the kokkos a
small creature. If this should reach the air when the fruit has ripened,
it becomes in appearance like a gnat, and immediately flies away. But as
it is they gather the fruit of the kokkos before the creature begins to
move, and the blood of the creature serves as a dye for wool.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.3">

Ambrossos lies at the foot of Mount Parnassus, on the side opposite to
Delphi. They say that the city was named after Ambrossos, a hero. On
going to war with Philip and his Macedonians the Thebans drew round
Ambrossos a double wall. It is made of a local stone, black in color and
very hard indeed. Each ring of wall is a little less than a fathom
broad, and two and a half fathoms in height except where it has broken
down.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.4">

The interval between the first ring and the second is a fathom. The
building of towers, of battlements, or of any ornament, has been
entirely neglected, as the only object the citizens had in constructing
the walls was immediate protection. There is a small marketplace at
Ambrossos, and of the stone statues set up in it most are broken.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">ANTIKYRA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.5">

The road to Antikyra is at first uphill. About two stadium-lengths up
the slope is a level place, and on the right of the road is a sanctuary
of Artemis surnamed Dictynnaean, a goddess worshipped with great
reverence by citizens. The image is of Aeginetan workmanship, and made
of a black stone. From the sanctuary of the Dictynnaean goddess the road
is downhill all the way to Antikyra. They say that in days of old the
name of the city was Kyparissos, and that Homer in the list of the men
of Phokis[^658] was determined to call it by this name, although it was
called Antikyra in Homer’s day, because Anticyreus was a contemporary of
Hēraklēs.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.6">

The city is situated in front of the ruins of Medeon. I have mentioned
in the beginning of my account of Phokis that the people of Antikyra
were guilty of sacrilege against the sanctuary at Delphi.[^659] They
were driven from home by Philip, son of Amyntas, and yet once more by
the Roman Otilius, because they were subjects of the Macedonian king
Philip, son of Demetrios. Otilius had been despatched from Rome to help
the Athenians against Philip.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.7">

The mountains beyond Antikyra are very rocky, and on them grows
hellebore in great profusion. Black hellebore sends those who take it to
stool, and purges the bowels; the nature of the other, the white kind,
is to purge by vomiting. It is the root of the hellebore which is used
as a purging drug.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.8">

In the marketplace at Antikyra are bronze statues, and at the harbor is
a small sanctuary of Poseidon, built of unhewn stones. The inside is
covered with stucco. The image, which is made of bronze, is a standing
figure, with one foot resting on a dolphin. On this side he has one hand
upon his thigh; in his other hand is a trident.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.9">

Opposite the gymnasium, in which the baths have been made, is another
gymnasium, an old one, in which stands a bronze statue. The inscription
on it says that Xenodamos of Antikyra, a contestant in the pankration,
won an Olympic victory in the match for men. If the inscription speaks
the truth, it would seem that Xenodamos received the wild olive at the
two hundred and eleventh Olympic festival.[^660] But this is the only
festival omitted in the Eleian records.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.36.10">

Beyond the marketplace, there is in a well a spring of water. Over the
well there is a roof to shelter it from the sun, with columns to support
the roof. A little higher up than the well is a tomb built of any stones
that were on hand. Here they say are buried the sons of Iphitos; one
returned safe from Troy and died in his native land; the other,
Schedios, died, they say, in the Troad, but his bones also were brought
home.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.1">

About two stadium-lengths off the city there is, on the right, a high
rock, which forms part of a mountain, with a sanctuary of Artemis built
upon it. The image of Artemis is one of the works of Praxiteles; she
carries a torch in her right hand and a quiver over her shoulders, while
at her left side there is a dog. The image is taller than the tallest
woman.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">BULIS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.2">

Bordering on the territory of Phokis is a land named after Boulon, the
leader of the colony, which was founded by a union of emigrants from the
cities in ancient Doris. The people of Boulis are said of Philomēlos and
the men of Phokis … the general assembly. To Boulis from Thisbe in
Boeotia is a journey of eighty stadium-lengths; but I do not know if in
Phokis there be a road by land at all from Antikyra, so rough and
difficult to cross are the mountains between Antikyra and Boulis. To the
harbor from Antikyra is a sail of one hundred stadium-lengths, and the
road by land from the harbor to Boulis we conjectured to be about seven
stadium-lengths long.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.3">

Here a torrent falls into the sea, called by the natives Herakleios.
Boulis lies on high ground, and it is passed by travellers crossing by
sea from Antikyra to Lekhaion in Corinthian territory. More than half
its inhabitants are fishers of the shellfish that produces the purple
dye. The buildings in Boulis are not so wondrous; among them is a
sanctuary of Artemis and one of Dionysus. The images are made of wood,
but we were unable to judge who was the artist. The god worshipped most
by the people of Boulis is named by them
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">Megistos</span> ‘the Greatest’,
a surname, I should think, of Zeus. At Boulis there is a spring called
Saunion.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">CIRRHA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.4">

The length of the road from Delphi to Cirrha, the port of Delphi, is
sixty stadium-lengths. Descending to the plain you come to a
race-course, where at the Pythian Games the horses compete. I have told
in my account of Elis[^661] the story of the Taraxippos at Olympia, and
it is likely that the race-course of Apollo too may possibly harm here
and there a driver, for the superhuman force
\[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">daimōn</span>\] in every
activity of man bestows either better fortune or worse. But the
race-course itself is not of a nature to startle the horses, either by
reason of a hero or on any other account.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.5">

The plain from Cirrha is altogether bare, and the inhabitants will not
plant trees, either because the land is under a curse, or because they
know that the ground is useless for growing trees. It is said that to
Cirrha … and they say that from Cirrha the place received its modern
name. Homer, however, in the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span>,[^662] and similarly in
the hymn to Apollo,[^663] calls the city by its ancient name of Crisa.
Afterwards the people of Cirrha behaved wickedly towards Apollo;
especially in appropriating some of the god’s land.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.6">

So the Amphiktyones determined to make war on the Cirrhaeans, put
Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sikyon, at the head of their army, and brought
over Solon from Athens to give them advice. They asked the oracle about
victory, and the Pythian priestess replied:—

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

You will not take and throw down the tower of this city, 

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

Until on my precinct shall dash the wave

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_verse_line">

 Of blue-eyed Amphitrite, roaring over the winedark sea.

</div>

<div custom-style="chs_normal_continue">

So Solon induced them to consecrate to the god the territory of Cirrha,
in order that the sea might become neighbor to the precinct of Apollo.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.7">

Solon invented another trick to outwit the Cirrhaeans. The water of the
river Pleistos ran along a channel to the city, and Solon diverted it in
another direction. When the Cirrhaeans still held out against the
besiegers, drinking well-water and rainwater, Solon threw into the
Pleistos roots of hellebore, and when he perceived that water held
enough of the drug he diverted it back again into its channel. The
Cirrhaeans drank without stint of the water, and those on the wall,
seized with obstinate diarrhoea, deserted their posts,

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.37.8">

and the Amphiktyones captured the city. They exacted punishment from the
Cirrhaeans on behalf of the god, and Cirrha is the port of Delphi. Its
notable sights include a temple of Apollo, Artemis and Leto, with very
large images of Attic workmanship. Adrasteia has been set up by the
Cirrhaeans in the same place, but she is not so large as the other
images.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">OZOLIAN LOKRIS, MYTHICAL
HISTORY</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.1">

The territory people of Lokris that is called Ozolian adjoins Phokis
opposite Cirrha. I have heard various stories about the surname of these
people of Lokris, all of which I will tell my readers. Orestheus, son of
Deukalion, king of the land, had a bitch that gave birth to a stick
instead of a puppy. Orestheus buried the stick, and in the spring, it is
said, a vine grew from it, and from the branches
(<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">ozoi</span>) of the stick the
people got their name.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.2">

Others believe that Nessus, ferrying on the Evenus, was wounded by
Hēraklēs, but not killed on the spot, making his escape to this country;
when he died his body rotted unburied, imparting a foul stench to the
atmosphere of the place. The third story says that the exhalations from
a certain river, and its very water, have a peculiar smell; the fourth,
that asphodel grows in great abundance and when in flower \[…\] because
of the smell.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.3">

Another story says that the first dwellers here were aboriginals, but as
yet not knowing how to weave garments they used to make themselves a
protection against the cold out of the untanned skins of beasts, turning
outwards the shaggy side of the skins for the sake of a good appearance.
So their own skins were sure to smell as badly as did the hides.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">AMPHISSA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.4">

One hundred and twenty stadium-lengths away from Delphi is Amphissa, the
largest and most renowned city of Lokris. The people hold that they are
Aetolians, being ashamed of the name of Ozolians. Support is given to
this view by the fact that, when the Roman emperor[^664] drove the
Aetolians from their homes in order to found the new city of Nikopolis,
the greater part of the people went away to Amphissa. The originated,
however, from the people of Lokris. It is said that the name of the city
is derived from Amphissa, daughter of Makar, son of Aeolus, and that
Apollo was her lover.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.5">

The city is beautifully constructed, and its most notable objects are
the tomb of Amphissa and the tomb of Andraemon. With him was buried,
they say, his wife Gorge, daughter of Oineus. On the citadel of Amphissa
is a temple of Athena, with a standing image of bronze, brought, they
say, from Troy by Thoas, being part of the spoils of that city. But I
cannot accept the story.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.6">

For I have stated in an earlier part of my work[^665] that two Samians,
Rhoecus, son of Philaios, and Theodoros, son of Telekles, discovered how
to found bronze most perfectly, and were the first casters of that
metal. I have found extant no work of Theodoros, at least no work of
bronze. But in the sanctuary of Ephesian Artemis, as you enter the
building containing the pictures, there is a stone wall above the altar
of Artemis called Goddess of the First Seat. Among the images that stand
upon the wall is a statue of a woman at the end, a work of Rhoecus,
called by the Ephesians Night.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.7">

A mere glance shows that this image is older, and of rougher
workmanship, than the Athena in Amphissa. The Amphissians also celebrate
mysteries in honor of the Boy Kings, as they are called. Their accounts
as to who of the gods the Boy Kings are do not agree; some say they are
the Dioskouroi, others the Kouretes, and others, who pretend to have
fuller knowledge, hold them to be the Cabeiri.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">MYONIA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.8">

These people of Lokris also possess the following cities. Farther inland
from Amphissa, and above it, is Myonia, thirty stadium-lengths distant
from it. Its people are those who dedicated the shield to Zeus at
Olympia. The town lies upon a height, and it has a grove and an altar of
the Gracious Gods. The sacrifices to the Gracious Gods are offered at
night, and their rule is to consume the meat on the spot before sunrise.
Beyond the city is a precinct of Poseidon, called Poseidonium, and a
temple of Poseidon is in it. But the image had disappeared before my
time.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">OEANTHEIA</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.9">

These, then, live above Amphissa. On the coast is Oiantheia, neighbor to
which is Naupaktos. The others, but not Amphissa, are under the
government of the Achaeans of Patrai, the emperor Augustus having
granted them this privilege. In Oiantheia is a sanctuary of Aphrodite,
and a little beyond the city there is a grove of cypress trees mixed
with pines; in the grove is a temple of Artemis with an image. The
paintings on the walls I found had lost their color with time, and
nothing of them was still left worth seeing.

</div>

<span custom-style="chs_Greek_high">NAUPACTUS</span>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.10">

I gather that the city got its name from a woman or a nymph, while as
for Naupaktos, I have heard it said that the Dorians under the sons of
Aristomakhos built here the vessels in which they crossed to the
Peloponnesus, thus, it is said, giving to the place its name.[^666] My
account of Naupaktos, how the Athenians took it from the people of
Lokris and gave it as a home to those who seceded to Ithome at the time
of the earthquake at Lacedaemon, and how, after the Athenian disaster at
Aigospotamoi, the Lacedaemonians expelled the Messenians from Naupaktos,
all this I have fully related in my history of Messenia.[^667] When the
Messenians were forced to leave, the people of Lokris gathered again at
Naupaktos.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.11">

The epic poem called the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Naupactia</span> by the Greeks is by
most people assigned to a poet of Miletus, while Kharon, the son of
Pythes, says that it is a composition of Karkinos of Naupaktos. I am one
of those who agree with the Lampsacenian writer. For what reason could
there be in giving the name of Naupactia to a poem about women composed
by an author of Miletus?

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.12">

Here there is on the coast a temple of Poseidon with a standing image
made of bronze; there is also a sanctuary of Artemis with an image of
white marble. She is in the attitude of one hurling a javelin, and is
surnamed Aetolian. In a cave Aphrodite is worshipped, to whom prayers
are offered for various reasons, and especially by widows who ask the
goddess to grant them marriage.

</div>

<div id="@urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.aprip-nagy:10.38.13">

The sanctuary of Asklepios I found in ruins, but it was originally built
by a private person called Phalysios. For he had a complaint of the
eyes, and when he was almost blind the god at Epidaurus sent to him the
poetess Anyte, who brought with her a sealed tablet. The woman thought
that the god’s appearance was a dream, but it proved at once to be a
waking vision. For she found in her own hands a sealed tablet; so
sailing to Naupaktos she ordered Phalysios to take away the seal and
read what was written. He did not think it possible to read the writing
with his eyes in such a condition, but hoping to get some benefit from
Asklepios he took away the seal. When he had looked at the wax he
recovered his sight, and gave to Anyte what was written on the tablet,
two thousand staters of gold.

easily accessible in the old but still useful edition of Allen 1912. The
plot-summaries of the epics in the Cycle are attributed to one Proclus,
who can most probably be dated to the second century CE (Nagy 2015.12.24
§1n5). These plot-summaries cover the following epics, attributed to
otherwise unknown poets as named here:
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Cypria</span>, by Stasinus of Cyprus;
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Aithiopis</span>, by Arctinus of
Miletus; <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Little Iliad</span>, by
Lesches of Lesbos; <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliou

<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek_high">Homer</span>. In the
Classical period and toward the end of the earlier archaic period, he
was thought to be the Master Narrator of the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>. (See under
<span custom-style="chs_emphasis">Classical period</span>,
<span custom-style="chs_emphasis">archaic period</span>, and
<span custom-style="chs_emphasis">Master Narrator</span>.) During the
post-Classical period as represented by the works of figures like
Plutarch and Pausanias in the second century CE, Homer was thought to be
the author of the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>, and his authorship
was viewed as a matter of ‘writing’,
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>. (HPC 31.)
During the Classical period as represented by the works of figures like
Plato and Aristotle in the fourth century BCE, Homer was likewise
thought to be the author of the Homeric
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span>, but his authorship
was viewed as a matter of ‘making’,
<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">poieîn</span>, analogous to the
crafting of an artifact by an artisan or craftsman: Plato and Aristotle
avoided any references to the making of Homeric poetry as a matter of
‘writing’, <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">graphein</span>. (HPC
31.) During the earlier Classical period as represented by the work of
Thucydides in the fifth century BCE, Homer was thought to be the author
of not only the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> but also of at least
some <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Homeric Hymns</span>, like the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Homeric Hymn to Apollo</span>. (HPC
18.) During this same period, as we see from the reportage of Herodotus
in the fifth century BCE, Homer was thought by some to be the author of
a wider range of epics, such as the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Cypria</span>. (HPC 75–78.) In the
archaic era, such epics were thought to be parts of a poetic corpus body
of epic poetry known as the epic Cycle. (See under
<span custom-style="chs_emphasis">archaic period</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_emphasis">epic Cycle</span>.) \[\[GN 2016.07.21

In this commentary, the article “the” will be avoided in wording that
refers to the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> together, as here.
That is because the <span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> are treated as
complementary epics in this commentary. In other words, the
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Iliad</span> and
<span custom-style="chs_citetitle">Odyssey</span> are treated together
as a structural unity. Such a unity can be traced back to the late
eighth and early seventh centuries BCE: see Nagy 2015.12.24 following

    <span custom-style="footnote reference"></span> Pausanias
    depersonalizes his narrative. The name of the author is known by way
    of Stephanus of Byzantium, who worked in Constantinople (also known
    as Byzantium) in the sixth century CE. Stephanus was the author of a
    geographical dictionary, and one of his sources was the work of
    Pausanias. See Habicht 1998:1. Stephanus, in his citations of
    Pausanias, occasionally indicates the number of the scroll from
    which the given citation is taken. See Habicht 1998:5n28. The work
    of Pausanias can be dated to the second half of the second century

    <span custom-style="footnote reference"></span> I take it that
    Pausanias here is guardedly indicating that he saw the tomb of
    Hippolytus himself, situated next to the tomb of Phaedra. Our
    traveler is guarded because, as he said earlier at 2.32.1 about the
    hero cult of Hippolytus, the people of Troizen ‘do not show
    \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">apophainein</span>\] his
    tomb \[<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">taphos</span>\],
    though they know where it is’. In the wording of Pausanias,
    <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikiā</span> ‘house’ can
    refer to the ‘abode’ of a cult hero, that is, to his tomb. And he
    ostentatiously uses this word here at 2.32.4. A telling parallel is
    the wording at Pausanias 2.23.2, where he refers to the tomb of the
    cult hero Adrastos as an
    <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikiā</span> while he calls
    the nearby tomb of Amphiaraos simply a
    <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">hieron</span>
    ‘sanctuary’<span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">—</span>and
    while, even more simply, he refers to the nearby tomb of Eriphyle,
    wife of Amphiaraos, as a
    <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span>, the literal
    meaning of which is ‘memorial marker’. This same word
    <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span> is used by
    Pausanias here at 2.32.4 with reference to the tomb of Hippolytus.
    For more on <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">mnēma</span> as
    ‘tomb’, see the relevant note at Pausanias 1.22.1. Other examples
    where <span custom-style="chs_translit_Greek">oikiā</span> refers to
    tombs of cult heroes include 2.36.8, 5.14.7, 5.20.6, 9.11.1. 9.12.3.
